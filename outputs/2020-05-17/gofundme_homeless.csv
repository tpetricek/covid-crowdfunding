Since then we have been doing daily outreach to 250-350 homeless serving food  hot drinks and having conversations. In the first 6 weeks we have served more than 11 000 meals.    We are committed to continuing this work until normal support facilities for the homeless have reopened.     Under One Sky is a collective of private individuals. Nobody is employed by Under One Sky. Our work is 100% volunteer based.    There was a need to move so quickly we didn't have the resource to launch a new fund raising campaign for our Covid19 emergency initiative. Instead we decided to use our winter fund raising page. The text below is from that campaign.    ---------------------------    Since 2012 Under One Sky has supported more than 3000 people living on the streets of London. Over the coming winter months  we hope to reach another 1000 homeless during our night walks.     Our work is inspiring others to join the Under One Sky family with events being planned in Cambridge (UK)  Madrid  and Boston (US).    In the last 12 months 9000 slept rough in London - an increase of 18%. Deaths among homeless in England and Wales increased by 22% to 726 in the same period.    Under One Sky is a 100% volunteer run collective of 450 passionate people with full-time jobs and families. At our most recent events  more than 10% of volunteers were children and teenagers. Our founding principle is that humanity is ONE family regardless of nationality  race  religion  class or any other label.    On cold winter nights we meet the homeless in a spirit of compassion and with a genuine desire to connect. To make them feel they belong in this world just as much as anyone else. Letting them know they have not been forgotten.    We distribute life support packages: food  clothing  toiletries  sleeping bags  gift cards  books  and messages of hope and light for those living in some dark times in their lives. The gift cards can be used to buy tents  winter clothing  or other necessities – they are a life saver. Our mantra: “For a better tomorrow  you must survive today”.    We are completely reliant on private funds  and every penny we raise goes directly to the homeless people we serve. Your donation will be used to buy gift cards and supplies.    You Will Make A Difference    We can’t wait to bring your donation to those who are fighting every day to simply stay alive. Our first winter event this year will take place on the night of Saturday 14th December where we will support at least 250 homeless people.    If you are not able to donate  then we would love for you to share our campaign using the “Share” button (below the “Donate Now” button) or using this link: www.gofundme.com/f/underonesky-homelessaid2020    It is also possible to support by donating sleeping bags using our Amazon Wish list    Finally  you are welcome to send us a message for us to share with the homeless – simply contact us on this page.    To learn more about the potential impact of your support…read below about:    - Two homeless men we helped get off the streets and into jobs recently    - Our aim to raise awareness about the realities of homelessness    - Our ""Very Important Homeless Person"" entertainment events launching in 2020     “At least we are under the same sky – you and I.” Ranata Suzuki    Campaign Team    Under One Sky helps bring a voice to the homeless  when often it feels as though nobody is listening. By telling their stories we hope to raise awareness to the realities about what being homeless truly means. We aim to educate and inspire more people to reach out and take action.    In early 2020 we will launch our first Very Important Homeless Person (VIHP) event. An afternoon of food and entertainment (music  talks  comedy) exclusively for the homeless – a moment to feel “normal”. We have support from a major music company who will help source artists  and a UK comedy streaming platform.    The real impact your support can have….    Last year  our Embankment team met Robert  who to their surprise was working for UberEats despite sleeping on the streets. He used our £30 gift card to buy a mobile charger for his bicycle so he would no longer lose out on income when charging his phone. The team were so impressed with Robert that we looked for other ways to support him. One afternoon we told his story on Facebook with a call out for job opportunities and housing. In a few hours he had four job interviews and two people offering him free temporary housing. Robert moved in the next day and had a job a week later. We also sponsored him so he could visit his mother who was diagnosed with cancer.    Two years ago  our Oxford Street team met a young homeless man named Singh and changed his life immediately. With their encouragement and a £30 gift card he bought a mobile phone and contacted his family. Our team were also able to arrange a job interview. Within six days Singh had a flat and a job. One year later he joined the same Oxford Street team that had helped him  to support other homeless people. Since then  Singh has been promoted twice at work  and is now saving up to buy a property.    We have heard many heart-breaking street stories over the years but often told by people with immense life spark. We have brought many smiles  hugs  and lifesaving supplies to those same people and we hope to bring many more this winter with your help.    Supporters    ",False

We provide food  clothing  toiletries and emotional support to our friends on the street. In order for us to continue our much needed operation and allow us to grow  we need to raise funds for a suitable vehicle which will carry our equipment for our walking groups and to supply a hot food station. This will also allow us to collect our essential donations from the public.     Having a van solely for use of the group will mean so much for the people in Glasgow. No matter how big or small your donation is  we are extremely grateful for every penny.     Please help where you can.    Following on from COVID19  we are providing a daily service to our homeless friends. We are providing hot food  kettled food  sandwiches  crisps  juices  toiletries and clothing on a daily basis. We service around approx 100 people per evening. Evening times and Glasgow Live have appealed on our behalf to the people of Glasgow to support our community group.

I felt that by doing a little bit for my local charity by having my head shaved  then that would go a small way to help this fantastic group of people.   The Bham Homeless support team are a non funded charity. The team go out to Birmingham in all weathers  support the homeless  re-clothe them  feed them etc. The people on the street have hit bad times  we are now facing a crisis unknown to anyone  anyone of us might find ourselves at this point  and these people are truly inspirational and without their dedication and desire to help alot of people would not survive. My city is a proud city  a sometimes misunderstood city  we need to look after our people and by giving as much as we can will help someone have clean clothing  food to eat etc.",True

are raising money and awareness for Help Bristol's Homeless  founded by Jasper Thompson.     If you want to donate less than £5 please use this page: https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/help-the-homeless-34    Jasper started out handing out food  then went onto a caravan mobile home and now runs a space with a bus with 10 beds along with 20 fully converted shipping containers that are now safe  stable and comfortable homes.     Our friends at Dazed  a Bristol based events company  have already raised £2 000 from the charity event they ran that featured drum and bass legends Roni Size and Danny Byrd who both gave up their time and skills for the cause.     It can be easy to feel alone around Christmas time on the streets but people like Jasper remind homeless people and everyone else  that they're willing to fight for you even if no-one else seems to be.     Let's do the same for Jasper with this. If you can help  please do - £5 can make a big difference.    We will be giving the money to Jasper via a cheque once we have reached our target. To provide transparency we will post a photo update of this.",True

It is becoming increasingly difficult for those in self isolation and the vulnerable (including the homeless and elderly) to collect shopping  prescriptions and other essential items . Because of this we are aiming to provide around 40 care packages for the most in need in our community. Any monetary donations or donations of essentials (including baby wipes  soap  toothbrushes  toothpaste  feminine hygiene products  snacks  bottled water  socks and blankets) would be greatly appreciated!!!

A team that is united through our passion for football.    Over the last few weeks the COVID-19 crisis has brought our team even closer together as we have taken time away from the training ground to reflect on what we can do for our society at a time when it needs us most.    We have a vision of creating a fund that can be used to support those that are vulnerable and we want to help spread the awareness of pressing issues that affect our community.    Our first fundraising project will be to support a great cause and local charity based right here in Bolton - Homeless Aid UK.    Homeless Aid UK is a group of volunteers that are dedicated to ending homelessness by delivering life-changing services and campaigning for change. They work at grass root levels with those who are struggling in the Bolton/Manchester area in particular and they supply essential food hampers and clothing to the growing number of people living in poverty.     As they rely solely on donations and the support of the local community  FC Bolton will help to raise funds for this cause.    We hope to inspire other grassroots football teams and youth groups within our community to come together in giving  aiding and raising money for those that are less fortunate.    Together we can make a real difference!",False

We’ve all seen people sleeping rough near where we live and work. Rough sleeping has more than doubled in London since 2010. During the past year alone  almost 9 000 people were seen sleeping out on London’s streets.    Welfare changes  soaring housing costs  and a shortage of affordable accommodation mean that more and more people are left with nowhere they can call home. The London Homeless Collective (29 charities with decades of experience in tackling homelessness) are working with the Mayor of London and local councils to provide services to help people rough sleeping to leave the streets.     Every Londoner can help too. You can donate to the London Homeless Collective so that we can offer more support to help people leave the streets and rebuild their lives.    Each member of this group has a specific project – such as providing emergency accommodation  longer-term support  or providing advice and assistance - that will benefit from your support. By giving your money to this coalition of charities  you can be confident that your donation will be distributed fairly and provide real help for people sleeping rough.     The Mayor of London  Sadiq Khan said: “The number of people sleeping rough on our streets is a national disgrace  and since becoming Mayor I have made it a priority to do everything in my power to tackle this crisis.    “The generosity of Londoners is well known  especially at this time of year  so I implore everyone to give what they can to help some of the most vulnerable people in our society.    “Every year we help record numbers through my winter programme - and while this is a testament to the hard work of outreach workers and shelter staff  it is also a damning indictment of the Government’s failure to get to grips with this vitally important issue.”     If you would like to find out more about the projects that will be funded email lhcg@homelesslink.org.uk    The London Homeless Collective comprises:    The 999 Club and Lady Florence Trust  The Albert Kennedy Trust  Barons Court Project  Caritas - Anchor House  Centrepoint Soho  The Church Army  The Connection at St Martins-in the-Fields  Crisis UK  Depaul UK  Evolve Housing + Support  Glass Door Homeless Charity  Homeless Action in Barnet  Homeless Link  Housing Justice  Kingston Churches Action on Homelessness  LookAhead  New Horizon Youth Centre  Providence Row  The Salvation Army  Shelter  the National Campaign for Homeless People Limited  The Single Homeless Project  Spear Housing Association Limited  St Mungo Community Housing Association  Thames Reach Charity  The Big Issue Foundation  Passage 2000  West London Mission Methodist Circuit  National Council of Young Men's Christian Associations  Veteran's Aid.    Homeless Link is managing and coordinating the equal distribution of donations across the London Homeless Collective coalition.     A bit about the process:    We are fortunate to have the support of GoFundMe who donated £5 000 towards the winter campaign and who have been incredibly supportive throughout the planning and launch stages. GoFundMe do not charge any platform fees. A processing fee of 1.9% and 20p applies to all donations. If you choose to claim Gift Aid on your donation  100% of this will be delivered to the charities. All funds will be distributed by PayPal Giving Fund to Homeless Link  who will distribute them equally between the 29 member charities.     Please do get in touch if you have any questions about the appeal or our work. Contact lhcg@homelesslink.org.uk",False

We’ve all seen people sleeping rough near where we live and work. During the past year  almost 8 000 people were seen sleeping out on London’s streets.    Welfare changes  soaring housing costs  and a shortage of affordable accommodation mean that more and more people are left with nowhere they can call home. Rough sleeping has more than doubled in London since 2010.    Homelessness charities are working with the Mayor of London and local councils to provide services to help people rough sleeping to leave the streets.     Every Londoner can help too. You can donate to the London Homeless Charities Group so that we can offer more support to help people leave the streets and rebuild their lives.    22 charities with decades of combined experience in tackling homelessness have come together to provide a single point for donations. By giving your money to this coalition of charities  you can be confident that your donation will be distributed fairly and provide real help for people sleeping rough.     Each of the participating charities has nominated a project that will benefit from your support. All the projects share a commitment to helping people sleeping rough or who are at risk of doing so  whether through providing assistance and advice  emergency accommodation  or the support people need over the long term. Contact us if you want to know more about our work by e-mailing LHCG@Mungos.org .    The Mayor of London  Sadiq Khan  said:     “Even one person sleeping rough in London is one too many  which is why I’m asking Londoners to join me on my mission to end homelessness.     “Last year Londoners generously donated £200 000 to homelessness charities  and made a record number of referrals through StreetLink  which helps outreach workers find rough sleepers and offer them support. This year  we’ve brought together 22 charities running homelessness projects who Londoners can give money to  both through this single donation page and through new contactless donation points across the capital.     “I urge Londoners to get involved  donate  and join me in doing all we can to help make homelessness a thing of the past.”    Sign up if you would like to receive updates about how the Mayor is helping rough sleepers off the streets .    Your donation could help towards a community initiative that provides safe rooms and support to young people  or it could help provide personalised  long-term support to someone who is homeless with mental or physical health issues. You could be supporting emergency severe weather shelters for people with nowhere else to turn in sub-zero temperatures  or specialised skills training to help someone experiencing homelessness into work. How ever much you are able to give this winter  you will be helping someone who is in crisis to access the support they need to stay off the streets for good.     The London Homeless Charities Group comprises:        St Mungo’s is co-ordinating the appeal for the LHCG this year and will distribute donations equally to the 22 charities to fund vital services for people in London who are sleeping rough or at risk of doing so.    We are fortunate to have the support of GoFundMe who have donated £5 000 towards the campaign and who have been incredibly supportive throughout the planning and launch stages. GoFundMe do not charge any platform fees  but a standard third-party payment processing fee of 1.9% applies to all donations. If you choose to add GiftAid to your donation  100% of the additional Gift Aid amount will go direct to the charities. All funds will be distributed by the Pay Pal Giving Fund to St Mungo's  who will distribute them equally between the 22 member charities.     The LHCG is also supported by TAP London. You can read more about their work here.    Please do get in touch if you have any questions about the appeal or our work. Contact LHCG@Mungos.org",False

Previously I have hired a van and drove around the streets of London with family and friends in tow whilst we distributed clothing/food/drink & bedding to any rough sleepers. However this year I will be doing something a bit different & I will be supporting Crisis in their campaign. For every £30 raised  Crisis will reserve a place for someone at one of their Christmas centres. Now I understand that £30 is a lot  so any donation you can make will all add up & all money raised from this campaign will be used to reserve places! The more we raise  the more places we can reserve Please help spread the word and let’s make this Christmas a little more pleasant and comfortable for those who really need it x",True

There is less access to food  and we are meeting that need by increasing our outreach  visiting the homeless men and women where they sleep on the streets most nights to ensure they have hot food  sandwiches  hot and cold drinks and other essentials that they need. But it's costing us around £100 per week just in fuel to keep going to provide these essentials. We have to keep going  we can't leave these men and women during this time of crisis  they can't go inside  they can't self isolate  and they still need food and drinks. Please help us wherever you can  Covid-19 is hard for all of us  but it's particularly hard for those who don't have a home  and can't close their front door to keep safe. All donations will help us to keep going to make sure we can still get out and help them.",True

The Grand Iftar is an inclusive voluntary community project organised by Oxford Homeless Project founders Shabnam Sabir and Tayyaba Hameed.   This year we have teamed up with volunteers from Oxford Mutual Aid  Oxford Community Action  BAPS Oxford and Oxford City Council to support as many people as we can.     The Grand Iftar celebrates and connects Oxford's diverse communities  people of faith and no faith during Ramadan over an Iftar (breaking of the fast) meal.     This year  because of the Covid-19 lockdown  we are unable to meet as a city and enjoy an Iftar meal together.     Instead  on Friday May 15th  our volunteers will organise and deliver at least 1 500 delicious meals to people in our city. Covid-19 is having a profound impact on people across our city. This is our way of celebrating our city and uniting communities during a challenging and difficult time.    Please donate to our fundraising page to help us cover the costs of offering a scrumptious 3 course ‘Grand Iftar’ meal . The more money we raise - the more meals we can provide!     Thank you!

In this day and age nobody should be living on the streets  everybody should have a place they can call home or a place they feel safe.    Many homeless people in Blackpool have been issued with dispersal orders by simply doing nothing wrong  I personally have come in to contact with some that have been issued with one as they've been sitting in a shop doorway keeping themselves to themselves or been getting their head down for the night on a street. How is this fair  they have nowhere to go? No home  no safe place! They just get moved on to which they locate at another place until they are moved on again.    The homeless need the help of the public to make them feel as though they have a purpose in life  to help them out of the vicious circle they find themselves in as nobody chooses to live on the streets. All they want is a normal life like the rest of us without being judged for the situation they've found themselves in.    I'm not saying I have the answers to be able to resolved this issue however I feel I can make a difference by raising awareness and help raise funds to support people in their time of need so this is why I've decided to do a 2 day sleep out to raise funds to support those in need of a homeless support kit.    I will be looking to do a 2 day sleep out in Blackpool starting Thursday 21st November at 12 midday and finishing on Saturday 23rd November at 12 midday.    I'm hoping to raise £1000 which will be to purchase the homeless support kit bag which will including the following items:    A camping rucksack to be able to carry their belongings  A tent   Waterproof coat & pants  Sleeping bag   Hat  scarf and gloves  Foil blanket  First aid kit  Cleansing & welfare pack which will consist of items such as toothbrush  toothpaste  shampoo  body wash  underwear  tissues    Please consider donating as much or as little as possible as every penny will help me purchase these essential items for the homeless.    Upon receiving donations  items will be purchase and published via an update along with a receipt showing items purchased.    Thank you for taking the time to visit and read my story.    Kind Regards   Tom    P.S - Please feel free to email helpblackpoolhomeless2019@gmail.com for any questions you may have or any donations you would like to make from the list above.

Instead he got a tent and sleeping bag and lived in a field in Litherland until kids starting constantly hassling him. Then a kind landlord heard of his problems and let him live in the back garden of the Red Lion pub. On 22nd Dec the landlord is leaving and Jaffa’s future is uncertain. He doesn’t have drug  alcohol  or mental health issues  so falls between the cracks of council support. He has never signed on the dole and instead  works 12 hrs a days  walking round the pubs of Liverpool selling socks  towels  or boxer shorts  if he doesn’t sell his stock  he doesn’t eat. Most days he lives on £5 a day for food.     He was born and bred in Nottingham. He told his jamaican mum at 7 that one day he would move to Liverpool to follow the mighty reds and by 12 he was living there. He followed Liverpool everywhere  and the kop could often be heard sing Jaffa Jaffa give us a song.     Please support him  winter is coming and no one should live like this. ",True

I will be fundraising by sleeping out in the city centre on Wednesday 22nd of January alongside my close friend Shane to experience what it’s like to sleep rough in cold conditions and feel what thousands of people go through daily. The charity is a close one to heart  I’ve seen Arif and his team work so hard over the years whether it’s the weekly feeds  running the charity shop  nightly checks  delivering and preparing emergency help or helping into people get into accommodation. My aim is to raise £1000  this money will be used to help with ending homelessness in Leicester!   Thank you to everyone that donates and let’s end homelessness and poverty now! ",True

This has now left me unemployed and essentially homeless.     With no transport (it came with the job) or prospect of being able to rent a property in the current situation I've had to use the last of any savings to buy a van to secure my belongings and to call home for the next few months or until normality restores and things start to look up.     The van will give me a roof and travel options  two birds with one stone.     Unfortunately the van isn't quite yet liveable  with no windows  insulation and a much used trade interior it needs a fair bit of work and a basic fit of plywood before I can fit in a bed  stay relatively clean  warm and not damp.    I have found a company that can do it  but now need the funds to store all my belongings and get the van there and back.    Any help at all would be a huge help! and the thanks will never be forgotten.    Thank you   Dan        ",True

We’ve all seen people sleeping rough near where we live and work. Rough sleeping has more than doubled in London since 2010. During the past year alone  almost 9 000 people were seen sleeping out on London’s streets.    Welfare changes  soaring housing costs  and a shortage of affordable accommodation mean that more and more people are left with nowhere they can call home. The London Homeless Charities Group (22 charities with decades of experience in tackling homelessness) are working with the Mayor of London and local councils to provide services to help people rough sleeping to leave the streets.     Every Londoner can help too. You can donate to the London Homeless Charities Group so that we can offer more support to help people leave the streets and rebuild their lives.    Each member of this group has a specific project – such as providing emergency accommodation  longer-term support  or providing advice and assistance - that will benefit from your support. By giving your money to this coalition of charities  you can be confident that your donation will be distributed fairly and provide real help for people sleeping rough.     However much you are able to give this summer  you will be helping someone who is in crisis to access the support they need to stay off the streets for good.     The Mayor of London  Sadiq Khan  said:     “Even one person sleeping rough in London is one too many  which is why I’m asking Londoners to join me on my mission to end homelessness.     “Last year winter Londoners generously donated almost £250 000 to homelessness charities  and made a record number of referrals through StreetLink  which helps outreach workers find rough sleepers and offer them support. This summer  we’ve once again brought together 22 charities running homelessness projects who Londoners can give money to  both through this single donation page.     “I urge Londoners to get involved  donate  and join me in doing all we can to help make homelessness a thing of the past.”    Sign up if you would like to receive updates about how the Mayor is helping rough sleepers off the streets .     If you would like to find out more about the projects that will be funded email lhcg@homelesslink.org.uk    The London Homeless Charities Group comprises:    Homeless Link is managing and coordinating the equal distribution of donations across the London Homeless Charities Group coalition.     A bit about the process:  We are fortunate to have the support of GoFundMe who donated £5 000 towards the winter campaign and who have been incredibly supportive throughout the planning and launch stages. GoFundMe do not charge any platform fees. A processing fee of 1.9% and 20p applies to all donations. If you choose to claim Gift Aid on your donation  100% of this will be delivered to the charities. All funds will be distributed by PayPal Giving Fund to Homeless Link  who will distribute them equally between the 22 member charities.     Please do get in touch if you have any questions about the appeal or our work. Contact lhcg@homelesslink.org.uk",True

Please take a moment to look through this spreadsheet.  You will see just how far your money can go.  A hot meal of corned beef hash and beans is less than 70p!  We have calculated for £1.20 we can provide a hot meal  hot drink  a packed lunch and bottle of water! We always give weekly updates of how we are getting on and who we have met and pass on stories from our homeless friends for you to read.  If you are on Facebook and interested  please send a friend request to Angela Hamlett and you will be able to see the work we carry out for yourselves. If you would like any more information regarding our work  please do not hesitate to contact myself or Nic. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and we look forward to hearing from you soon.              ",True

I know people who wouldn’t have survived this long.     I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Dex. He’s a serving police officer for over 10 years who joined after 13 years in HM Forces-Royal engineer Bomb Disposal and high risk search team commander. Like too many of our friends  families and colleagues Dex has hit tough times. After being diagnosed with PTSD in 2017 by Combat stress Dex was unable to carry on working. Following 6 months of being off sick from work he went onto half pay and 6 months later he was on NO PAY. As happens to all too many Dex’s marriage broke down due to the stress of his illness and he found himself homeless. Yes. A serving police officer sleeping rough! This stuff happens. Who cares for the carers when it all goes wrong. We do. A man who has served his Country and given over 17 years of public service now needs the GREAT British public to repay their thanks by small donations. Lots of small donations add up. I want to secure his safety and well being for the next 6 months whilst we support him into some housing pending being retired on ill health.     He’s a good man who needs our help.

(Not just a Facebook friend but an actual friend from our college years)    Oben lives in Istanbul  Turkey  and I cannot put into words how selfless this woman is. She walks the streets both day and night tirelessly feeding and caring for the many homeless  unfed and often poorly dogs &puppies of Turkey. she does so primarily from her own pocket and any food donations people are kind enough to sometimes offer. She sends me the videos of her endless work regularly  and though it’s heartwarming to watch  it’s also heartbreaking at the same time! Oben always puts the needs of these dogs before that of her own! And for this reason I’m more than proud to call her my friend❤️❤️❤️ Unfortunately today she sent me a really upsetting message  one she has never sent me before in all our decades of friendship  and it broke my heart to read it:     “Hi Danielle  I dont know how to ask this so I'm just gonna ask You know I currently have about 40 something dogs in my direct care and I feed them everyday... I use a pack of dog food everyday which is 15 kilos. Up until this year I managed to get some help from people who donated dog food to me... but this year I am literally on my own... And I am financially done for  I cannot afford more food right now. But these dogs rely on me&I dont know what to do...    I’ve even been buying chicken and boiling and mixing it with pasta! they like it but its just not enough...   I was wondering if you could maybe organise some sort of food donation thing for me... I never ever ever accept money... only dog food!!!! https://www.carrefoursa.com/tr/jetix-kuzu-etli-kopek-mamasi-15-kg-p-30257508This is a very reliable web site and very good dog food for very resonable price...I think its about £10 a pack (15 kilos) .... ı am so sorry for asking this I would never ask if I wasnt desperate. You know that. İf any one you know is interested in donating I could give you my address and they could order&send the food directly to me...    I just came from feeding them and today I had to add bread to their food... This is the hardest message I have ever had to send And I’m so so sorry for asking this of you! But I am so very desperate. Oben”    Anybody who knows me is fully aware of my love for animals  but Oben goes above and beyond to help these dogs. She even takes them to the vets for treatment whenever she can afford to. So I’m asking on behalf of my amazing friend  if anyof my other friends or family could send her a helping hand As Oben said herself: she never accepts money  only dog food! And so I have set up this page in the hope that anybody wanting to help-can either order her a bit of food from the above website  and I can give you her postal address  or if you could donate however much you can spare  every single pound or penny would be much appreciated and ever so helpful  then we can hopefully order her a bulk amount of food and get it to her urgently.     I’ve never done a GoFundMe before  but I can’t think of a better reason to do one  as I know her personally  and I know how much this will mean to her and her cause.  I have set the goal amount of £560 as this would provide 2 months worth of food!!! A huge Thank you from both of us     Danielle & Oben xXx ",True

On Wednesday 9th of December 2015  I witnessed something very disturbing and until today it is very much bothering me.    The sister and her toddler have been sofa surfing for the past 2 years now  due to dire circumstances. The last place where she was staying  she had to move out of a few weeks ago. Her last resort was to move with her mother who is not muslim. The mother HATES the fact she is muslim. When she went back  her mother was causing arguments with her. She even called the police (Friday 4th of December) on the sister for saying she delibrately broke off a door handle of the lounge door. Hence the lounge door was already broken.....it was bound to fall off eventually.  When police arrived on the Friday night  the police said the call was a waste of their time.   The sister decided to leave for the weekend and stay with a friend for a few days until the situation calms down.    On the Monday 7th of December 2015 when she attempted to re enter the house the locks were changed. She called her mother on the Monday and the Tuesday and her mother ignored every single call. On the Wednesday the sister tried again and to her findings her mother had blocked her number.  Myself (Ayman) and others accomapanied the sister and her toddler to the mothers property  on the purpose to get answers and get all her belongings from the house. When we arrived  we rang the door bell the mother looked through the door and refused to open the door. We were knocking for over an hour. What got to me is that knowing her grandchild was out in the cold and rain for over an hour  and she can hear the cries. She called the police on the sister once again. Alhamdulillah the sister didn't get arrested. We explained that we needed to get all her belongings from the property. The police said she could get some items but not all.  We had to get a storage on behalf of the sister to put her items in alhamdulillah. The sister had no where to go and wanted to stay in the storage. We managed to put them somewhere for a few nights alhamdulillah.    Her mother is now refusing for her to get the rest of her items subhanAllah. She has threatened her with an injunction and apparently she is filing papers to the court so that she can not be in a certain amount of distance of her house.  Also her family members are of no help whatsover.    The sisters name is on the council (government) waiting list and the bourough she is under has limited properties. She has updated them with the recent events and they said she has to make a whole new application and provide new documents. Some of these documents has to come from the mother who is refusing to give them to her. The council are saying they will not process nothing unless they have everything.     I want to raise this money for the sister and her child inshaaAllah. So they can have peace of mind. The money will be used to pay for a place to rent by a muslim landlord in London UK for a year inshaaAllah. This will help her tremendously inshaAllah and make her get back on her feet.    Please donate anything you can even if its a penny inshaAllah.    May Allah reward you all for sharing this and donating Ameen ",True

This winter we hope to make that 3000.    Under One Sky is run on a 100% voluntary basis from private donations. Every penny we receive ends up as support for the homeless. Our 400 volunteers make it possible for us to come to them on the streets.    During the winter we hand out gift cards  clothing  sleeping bags  meals  books and messages of hope and light to the homeless. The gift cards can be used to buy tents  winter clothing or other life necessities.    It all starts with meeting the homeless in the spirit of compassion. To make them feel they belong in this world just as much as anyone else. That they have not been forgotten - 8000 people slept rough in London in the last year.    Under One Sky was founded on the principle that humanity is ONE family…we are brothers and sisters regardless of nationality  race  religion  class or any other label.    “Only from the heart can you touch the sky.” Rumi    Unspoken Truths    Our street teams get to the truths that politicians and sensational headlines hardly touch.    · We hear of lives filled with trauma and rejection right from childhood.    · Deep emotional scars leading to mental health issues. 90% of homeless have mental health issues – depression being the most common.    · Not to mention the lives of friends lost. In the past year 440 homeless people died in the UK – right before our eyes.     But other truths you rarely hear about either are:    · The level of empathy among many homeless that most of us struggle to match.    · The wisdom and social intelligence gained from a life of struggle.    · The courage to tell strangers about their deepest scars and to let the tears flow.    You Make A Difference    Your funds will be spent on buying gift cards to shops that sell basic necessities such as tents  sleeping bags and winter clothing. These will be handed out at our Night for the Homeless events in London. The math is simple…for every £5000 we raise we reach 150 homeless people.    To appreciate your potential impact read two stories from our 2017/18 winter events below.    We can’t wait to bring your donation to those who are fighting to stay alive daily. Our first winter event is on 15 Dec 2018.    If you are not in a position to donate then we’d love shout-out on Facebook  LinkedIn  Twitter  Instagram etc.    Street Success Stories    Our team who covered Oxford Street for our January event made an incredible difference to a homeless man’s life in less than a week. The team had a long chat with him and gave him the encouragement needed to get him to contact his estranged brother. The man used the £30 gift card we gave him to buy a mobile and minutes. He contacted his brother and within 2 days the brother had arranged for accommodation in a flat share. A huge win. One of the team members told him of a job opportunity at a company. A job interview arranged. He nailed the interview and got the job…and ended up being promoted within probation period. In 6 days  he went from the street to being housed and employed.    In Dec 2017 our Camden team met a homeless couple (G and L). G (male) was serving in the British Army in Afghanistan when a car crash took his wife and three daughters. His world crumbled…he lost job and home. L  his now female partner (then friend)  stuck by him as his life disappeared like sand between his fingers. When our team met G he was undergoing chemotherapy on NHS. Sleeping on the streets…and receiving chemo. Two team members Mark and Marnie helped the couple with a deposit on a studio flat. With a roof over their heads L landed an office job and G landed a carpentry job. In only a few months this couple had a new path ahead of them.    We have heard many heart-breaking street stories over the years but often told by people with immense life spark. We have brought many smiles and hugs to those same people and we hope to bring many more this winter with your help.    Campaign Team        Supporters        ",True

Last year I decided that I would start collecting for the homeless in both North and South of Ireland. My first collection was fantastic  I had great support from the public. I have since done 2 more and with the help of local businesses who give me storage and somewhere to sort it all out I have been able to grow it more and more .     This will be my 4th collection and I'm hoping that I will be able to fill a 20ft container again which is kindly donated by VK Removals and Storage cookstown.     Im hoping with the money I raise through the Go Fund me page I will be able to purchase sleeping bags... This is a big necessity to the homeless  it's a little bit of comfort to them instead of sleeping with cardboard boxes over them   can you even imagine that?  I am also doing a collection of clothe items ie coats hats scarves  food items like pasta rice etc and whatever else would make life a little bit more comfortable for those on the streets. This is taking place at my business Designer Hats For Hire  on Saturday 30th November between 12pm and 6pm. . . I also have a few other businesses involved with me this time round and the support has been fantastic     With your help I can make it even bigger    So instead of buying socks or that deodorant set for dad or granddad or those slippers that might never be used maybe you could donate it and give someone a little bit of warmth and comfort for a few nights on the streets. .     Who knows  you or I could be in the same position next year.     Thanks for reading ",True

As most people are aware my passion and my heart is with homeless people I am hoping to raise money to be able to purchase sleeping bags and underwear for those people who are sleeping in our streets in this cold weather .   I have been talking to help the homeless Glasgow who are in desperate need of these items . I would also hope to purchase some xmas presents for these people who will wake up on xmas morning on the streets of city centre while we wake up in our warm homes . These people dont choose this life sometimes you just fall in to this life not by choice but not for any one to judge   as at the end of the day it can happen to any one of us.   So if you can even spare as much as £1 to £2 this would even get a can of deodorant to make up an hygiene pack that I will be handing out also .   The £40 I paid to register will automatically go to beatson cancer .  Many thanks",True

We are also preparing packs of toiletries  clothing and food to give to multiple homeless shelters across the Wirral. Any money that comes as extra will be donated to the charities also.    Roughly 320 000 people are homeless across the UK  which is 1 in every 201 Brits  equating it to be a major issue for the British government. There are few homeless shelters but many cafes that provide food for free for homeless people in the Wirral.

See this link to read more about our COVID-19 outreach activity https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/coronavirus-packs-homeless-london-volunteers-a4384786.html    The ever growing homelessness is alarming and this needs to be addressed urgently. We recently visited local businesses around north London to collect donations which we are very grateful for namely: Tesco  Sainsbury's  Poundland  Weston Park Bakery  Crouch appreciation Society and Rowans Tenpin bowls. We set up by Finsbury Park Bridge on New Year’s Day and handed out hot soups  tea  coffee  cakes  baguette’s  chocolates and sanitary items which were requested upon a recent survey. We also offered hot drinks to passers by who were also very grateful as this initiative is a community project. We hope to continue doing this for the homeless every month. We also noted that many of the homeless were women and were in desperate need of sanitary items  which we also gave out. We will be liaising with local councils/ churches/ community centres etc to discuss options/initiative’s we can put in place to make this go from strength to strength. Our first launch took place on New Year’s Day and it was a very humbling experience with a large turn out.

Instead of renting a hall  cooking meals and serving the food to the community indoors  we have decided to make food hampers and deliver them.    We will be delivering food hampers to families who are struggling financially and cannot afford basic kitchen essentials. The hampers will include all essential ingredients to help families to prepare food. For example  they will receive oil  sugar  tea  perishable goods  flour  jam and cheese ..    As the community attempts to reduce social contact  we decided it’s not appropriate to deliver the project in the usual way. However  it’s important that we help those families in need who are left without work and cannot access local shops due to health conditions putting them at further risk. We have been given authroisation to deliver food instead.   PLEASE READ OUR STORY!   Each year  during the month of Ramadan  we fundraise to feed the homeless community  in Marrakech.    The Moroccan association  Massar for Cultures and Art  is a not-for-profit organisation  which runs various volunteering community projects. These projects include supporting orphanages  children and adults with disabilities  delivering activities for children on the streets  and feeding the homeless. The association also performs theatre shows in the community and delivers workshops in other villages.     During the holy month of Ramadan  our charity runs a food kitchen for the homeless  in Marrakech. Food is provided for 150 homeless people everyday for Iftar  over the 30 days (23/04/20 - 22/05/20). As Ramadan is fast approaching  we are (hopefully) able to fundraise £1500 (18 000 MAD) to fund the feeding homeless project during Ramadan. All money raised goes directly towards buying food and cooking materials for the project. As you can see from the pictures  we have limited resources and feed a vast number of people over the course of the month. It is important that we have enough funds to run the programme successfully. Basic things  such as bowls  plates and plastic cups  are needed as well as food ingredients. If anyone would like to donate or send plastic plates  cups etc. i can take these donations or send you an address.    Last year  we managed to raise just over £1000  which was fabulous but it wasn’t enough to fund the whole month of Ramadan. This year  we are hoping to raise a little more with your kind donations  so that we are able to provide more and a wider variety of food over the course of the month.     I first began volunteering with the Moroccan charity in May 2018 and supported this project throughout the holy month of Ramadan. All the volunteers do an incredible job and providing food for the homeless community in Marrakech was a very rewarding experience! Please watch the youtube video and see the attached pictures to see just how much of a difference our donations make.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xItEgNxGSUE&feature=youtu.be    Thanks for reading!

The people we spoke to were so grateful and wouldn’t accept the food if they’d already eaten saying to give it somebody else that may not have had food that day. One of them wouldn’t take the gloves as he already had a pair and said to save them for someone who needed them more than him. How selfless if that! Not greedy and not one of them approached us. Despite being sat in the freezing cold with nowhere to go and no Christmas to look forward to  they were all still smiling and wishing us a Merry Christmas. We take for granted so much and don’t realise how lucky we are to have a home to go to and to have people around us who care. I know some people have made bad decisions in their lives but it’s not always their fault that they’ve ended up in that situation. That’s why I’m asking for a little help so that this Christmas Eve we can give more than a few blankets here and there. I’d like to get sleeping bags  blankets  hats  socks  thermals and hot food & hot drinks. Even if it puts a smile of their faces for a just that moment. Whether you believe in giving to charities or not  these are people sleeping outside in the cold  starving and alone in our communities.",True

head this Christmas.    12 year old Raghu and his Mum Suman  are currently homeless in Ahmedabad  India. They live together at the end of a footpath on the side of a road.     She became homeless six years ago when her husband sadly passed away. This was made worse by an unfortunate accident  where she lost her right hand.    Suman struggles has problems walking and needs medical assistance. She also has a problem in one of her eyes that needs urgent medical attention.    With only one hand  she has struggled to find enough work to support herself and her young boy. She survives by doing basic tailoring work on the street for small change.    In the UK we have support systems in place to make sure that children have shelter. Raghu doesn’t have that. He sleeps outside with his Mum at the end of a footpath  where they’re vulnerable to predators and the elements.    This family needs a little human kindness to help get back on their feet. Let’s work together to get this family into a safe  warm home and help this young boy get an education to better his chances in life.     Suman has an elder Son who lives nearby  but has no resources to help her. We’d like to get little Raghu and his Mother into an apartment nearby the elder Son  so that he can support them with day to day things  within his capabilities.     We want to raise enough money to:    · find a rental apartment for them which has kitchen facilities  heating and hot water. (approx. £60 per month) and cover the rent for at least twelve months    · Cover basic utility and living expenses for the same period    · provide them both with basic furniture  utensils and food    · buy clean clothes & shoes for them both.    · To provide access to a Doctor & Dentist for a check-up and any medicine they need.    · help Suman Ben find some work or access welfare to secure a source of income.    · help Raghu enrol in school and catch up on his missed education.    · Pay a trusted local person with use of a car to transport them to various appointments to facilitate the above things.

Hopefully drop-in centres and other facilities will be able to open safely soon  but in the meantime we need to act quickly to help.   Any help highly appreciated  the rough sleepers will be grateful.  I have seen the situation at Trafalgar Square  where I am helping handing out food to the homeless  it is quite sad to see so many people still on the street  numbers rising  with less support than before. It won't solve the problem  but the kits will at least ease the situation for the individuals temporarily. For the kit we will need:     Plastic or Tote bags  2 litres bottle of water  hand sanitiser  toothpaste  toothbrush and cover of folding brush  deodorant  Soap bar  6 pack of tissues  Facial wipes  Wet toilet wipes  chocolate bars    MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE PLAN AND HOW YOU CAN HELP HERE:  https://www.notion.so/Emergency-Hygiene-Kits-Appeal-3bebf69279a24db7a1a5bf4a6f15d2d2    With the help of volunteers from Hoxton West Mutual Aid and Re-action I hope to get 500 kits together over the next 4 weeks  125 a week  to be distributed in Hackney in liaison with the outreach organisations  who provide food all over the borough. Surplus to be distributed in other hotspots  like Trafalgar Square and King's Cross.    Please give what you can – if you are still paid  think about how much money you are saving right now :-)",True

5","Christmas is one of the toughest times of the year for lots of people. Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland. Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen feed people seven days a week and will now be able to buy pallets of fresh produce to cook with  whilst the foodbank will be able to use the money to produce emergency three day food parcels.

I have been on nights out where drunk people have stepped on and kicked over someones pot of money and laughed and am found disgusted by the way that some humans treat other humans. I give away my change when I have some however with contactless banking nowadays etc barely any of us carry change anymore. I see the homeless struggle at this time of year  with everyone saving money and spending on Christmas and presents and would love to give something small to a handful of people who must use the concrete as a bed at night and may not have a Christmas dinner. Unwrapping a christmas present is something we all take for granted and it could help someone who is lost keep hope! Isabel De La Paz and I are looking to raise £100 in 10 days in order to buy a few small gifts for the homeless to keep them warm this Christmas  if you can give anything towards that we would be extremely grateful  the more we can raise the more people we can reach! If you are unable to donate please share this page for awareness! Be grateful this Christmas :)",True

We understand if this is not what you intended your donation for and if you feel you would like your returned please feel free to request it.     When we are able to access the funds we will be depositing the funds on to a pre paired credit card as we do not have a bank account to put the funds into at the moment   as soon as its cleared we are having a meeting with a local organisation who are better informed on helping homeless people.    Anthony is getting on great these days he has been very lucky and we have introduced him to some people who are leading him in the right direction we are hoping this will lead to a permanent position for him who knows watch this space ....",True

Using the knowledge that we have gained using legislation that is in place to help house our veterans  we wish to continue to work with local authorities and councils to make sure that they are all abiding by the Acts that are in place. We have contacts with over 80 local authorities and councils who are abiding by legislation and we hope to continue and make many more working relationships. However we can only carry out this work with the help of the general public. Whilst working with legislation will save a huge amount of money there are still costs involved with providing deposits or rent in advance as well as furniture  clothing and welfare support etc etc. We will carry on our working relationships with many other organisations and charities and we have the full support of many influential individuals within government and the MOD. 100% of money raised will be used to help our veterans as nobody is taking any wages. I have been asked to go along this route of setting this CIC up by many friends and supporters of the work that i do and whilst i am no fan of GO Fund Me pages  this is the only way i can raise the funds needed. Our two Trustees are Lord Stephen of Westbury who has great influence in the charity sector and is also a veteran himself and we have WOII Neil Hague who is currently serving in The Royal Military Police and has a huge amount of contacts and influence combined with his job role. Our Two Ambassadors are Samantha Bunford and Samantha Shapley who are both so passionate about making a difference to the Veterans that have served our country and have worked alongside myself for over 2 yrs. The volunteers we have in place have been with me for over 3 years and together we make a formidable team and we work on the ethos of there is no ( I ) in Teamwork. So there we are. We are hoping to become registered as a full charity within 6 months and whilst you may all say """" Not Another Charity """" which i understand please look at my record of housing veterans which i believe speaks for itself.

On Thursday 19 March 2020  Zimbabwe recorded its first COVID-19 case. Zimbabwe is undergoing a tough time economically and many Zimbabweans live hand to mouth and do not have much in terms of savings and stored goods in case of emergency.     When lockdown was announced on Friday 29 March 2020  many casual labour employees lost their form of income resulting in another crisis of how to feed their families.    Furthermore  with a lack of water facilities in many parts of the country  washing hands is not something that comes as easily as turning on a tap. Sanitisers are expensive and without an income  their small reserves will go to food.    By supplying buckets  soap and hand sanitisers it will give them a greater chance in fighting this pandemic!     http://www.vimba.co.uk/home/",True

We are at a point where we believe we could help and support the start of a self-contained container home  if we can raise vital funds to start this project off.     We know that the crisis in Leeds is getting worse  if we can have these containers as a halfway point before they secure another pathway or permanent affordable social house.   This would also give us a base/Hub to be able to do vital paperwork/referrals to organisations that could vitally help at that moment with one of our guys who we help. We are going down the professional route with engaging with a local solicitors firm to form a professional organisation - fighting homelessness in Leeds called Vulnerable Citizen Support.     We have now joined forces with #Acecontainers in Leeds  one of the leading container firms in Leeds & the UK. This project has just become exciting with so many directions we can go down.     We are will be showing our #Pilot/#Model design within the coming weeks  with our spec being drawn out as we speak  we will be converting a 20x8 Container into a insulated 1 bedroom self contained home. With speaking with the design man (Dave) at #Acecontainers we aim to provide the following facilities.     1 x Shower   1 x Toilet   1 x Bed   1 x Drop Down Table   1 x Wardrobe     Cooking facilities will be separate for a Health & Safety point of view at the moment  we are asking for as much help as possible. Lately everybody has started to come together  contributing in many different ways.     This will be a project that needs alot of man time and power and will gain more experience as time goes on.

(Bukhari)    We serve on average 80 plates of hot food alhamdulillah.    Who Are We?  We are a small group of Muslim friends who feed the homeless twice a month and provide essentials like sleeping bags  rucksacks  tents  socks and  during winter months; gloves  balaclavas  winter socks and emergency blankets. Alhamdulillah we have been doing this for over 4 years in Charing Cross  London outside the Zimbabwean Embassy.    ​How Do Your Donations Help?  You provide warm food for those in need  you give them a warm place to sleep for the night  a shelter when it's windy or raining and a place to store their belongings. In the ice cold winter you help keep their hands  feet and faces from freezing.     Such A Blessing!  In February 2016 Allah blessed us with the ability to start our project and we started out distributing sandwiches  fruit  crisps and water. Al hamdulillah  shortly after we progressed to serving warm  cooked food  directly onto the service users plates. We have stuck to that method as we want to ensure the needy get wholesome warm food.     They Love the Chicken!   We have volunteers who cook; some regular  some when they can and the favourite food that we take down to the homeless is the 'chicken'! They love the chicken! Oh and hard boiled eggs! They love to take them for later when no food is available. A great source of protein.     Chicken and rice was on the menu!    Sleeping Bags  Tents  Rucksacks Etc.  We also progressed into taking down the essentials like sleeping bags etc. And have them on hand for anyone who asks  which they usually do and once you go to the car for one  the rest follow. So many are in need that we can't even supply for everyone as we just don't have the funding.     Man happily received a sleeping bag from our brother Abdul Raheem.     A homeless brother needed a rucksack.     Homelessness Isn't Racist  The homeless in London are from all over the World but primarily the UK and Europe. Muslim and non Muslim. Can you imagine sleeping on the ground without something to keep you warm  or in the rain with out a shelter  or no where to store the small amount of belongings that you have? We truly are blessed to have homes  and food to eat whenever we want. Al hamdulillah! Please be a part of making their lives better with the little that they have.     Yummy rice  chicken and vegetables during Ramadan. Date's too!    Please note  Prices for supplies are approximate depending on availability. We can't buy wholesale as we don't have the storage capacity so we buy from Ebay or Amazon at the best prices we can find at the time. ",True

We have been operating as an outreach support team to the most vulnerable and ensuring as many people as possible have shelter  warmth  food  drink and are shown kindness- the fundamental pillars of survival and wellbeing.     Before Christmas we set up a health and wellbeing day for those who are rough sleeping  sofa-surfing and families struggling to make ends meet in Hereford. The day was a great success with a huge response with donations in food  clothing  toys and we were able to make hampers to deliver to families in our community on Christmas Eve which also really made a difference!     On the day we had over 30 people  mostly who are rough sleeping and at the winter night shelter and we received fantastic feedback. They were able to get hot showers  have a hot meal  get a haircut and socialise with others not in their day-to-day circles and enjoyed the conversations. They were also able to take food and clothing away with them.    A few days after Christmas we received messages from people we had met on the day and some dangerous situations for those who weren’t staying at the shelter came to light. We are very aware of the amazing job the shelter  hot food provisions and all the other organisations involved in homelessness are doing  but we can’t help but see urgent needs which are easily solved in the short term for those still sleeping rough. We continue to distribute warm clothing  waterproof boots  shelter  coal and wood  food  hot water bottles and rucksacks full of basic survival resources. We have run two other provision and socials days and been out on foot most days in the most severe weather to make sure everyone we know of is as warm and safe as possible  providing assistance and resources whenever needed.     The support from the community for all initiatives has been incredible and whilst we are also looking into long term solutions with partner organisations  with the help of continued support and donations we will continue to provide these basic provisions because we know there is still more needed immediately for some of our community’s most vulnerable.     We are thrilled to be in the process of setting up as a registered charity which will enable us to access further funding and support from businesses to be able to secure a premises and reopen a day centre in Hereford. This vision will ensure that those who find themselves homeless are able to access shelter  food and drink  clothing and ongoing support in a neutral  safe and inclusive environment.

Since Coronavirus came to the U.K. homelessness has increased  many people losing their jobs and unable to pay their rent have now found themselves on the streets along with the heartbreaking amount that were already living there. Without the foot traffic or leftovers from cafes and restaurants they are in dire need of food  shelter and warm clothes. Under One Sky (www.underonesky.cc) are a volunteer based charity doing everything they can to provide them with these necessities.     As I have no easy access to London right now I thought raising money for them to continue their work  and spreading the word (maybe even encouraging others in the capital to volunteer??) was the best I could do. This is the article that kicked my butt into gear  give it a read if you want to know more about the current situation: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/london-coronavirus-sacked-hospitality-workers-sleeping-rough    Running - 5k a day  in May    I know this might not sound hard for some  but as a novice runner  who’s never been able to ‘run long distance’  running 5k is still a struggle for me. I’m also very much a fair weather runner  being put off at the slightest bit of rain. So my aim is to run 5k every day for the month of May  come rain or shine. I also am aware that a lot of people are struggling for money at the moment  or out of work completely. So by all means don’t feel like you have to donate if you can’t afford to  or if you can spare as little as £5 it will definitely be appreciated. If you can do anything  volunteer / spread the word / share this info with people who can help  then that too would be amazing.",True

I'm Kerry :)    Periods are not a great time of the month for any woman  but for homeless women with very limited access to the expensive 'luxury' of sanitary items  it is a truly awful and humiliating time  and because of the taboo that surrounds the topic  it's something that doesn't often cross our mind.    Some women are forced to use ripped up cloths  old socks or toilet roll from public toilets  or make a few tampons last the entire length of their period. This can lead to infections  and so it isn't just the emotional impact - it's also the danger to women's health.    This is why I have joined Keely and the rest of the team at the Albert Street Project in Birmingham in promoting The Homeless Period  to supply the women in Edinburgh with the items they struggle to get access to.    I now co-ordinate the Edinburgh project  collecting donations of wipes  underwear and sanitary items and produce female care packages which are delivered to various projects and shelters across the city    If you would like to help  you can donate here  or drop/send sanitary items to:   The Mash Tun  154 Easter Road  Edinburgh  EH7 5RL    The money and donations go towards creating our special period care packs  which each contain underwear  wipes  and a selection of sanitary products. These packs will be going out to other homeless charities and projects in Edinburgh to make a difference for as many women as possible who are in difficult circumstances  allowing their dignity and health to be maintained through their periods.

My name is Charlene Davis. I am finding this very hard to do and don't even know how to start. For me this is way out of my depth but indeed my situation has gotten so deep I guess I'm desperate and asking for help just seems like the best and only option. So I have a council place  I been living here for 18 years since April 22nd 2002. Prior to then I had lived in many hostels  around 7 or 8. Due to family domestics and breakdowns I was on my iwn from aged 16  my last year of school. I fell pregnant aged 17 and moved into my house with my baby aged 18. I later had another son and made home for the 3 of us. As a young single parent back then  I always had my priorities in.check  I made sure rent  council tax  gas and electricity were taken care of. However  as I was a person who enjoyed their independancy and constantly strived I would seek employment or studies. For some reason this always disrupted my rent account due to the changes. Eventually I was summoned to court for rent arrears eviction back in 2018. I was currently unemployed at the time. I was ordered to pay £133 per month off my rent. The problem I was facing was I was on Universal Credit And my take home pay after all these deductions was £190 per month. Which I was meant to pay £133 towards my arrears. This was ridiculous  unrealistic and started to affect my mental health. I became very depressed  had frequent panic attacks and just a lifeless soul. In 2019  I was diagnosed with ADHD. And I was given the book called 'The Gift of Add in Adults'. It really helped me to understand myself better  and to relate to things  vwhy I felt so different to the world. I began taking my prescribed medication XL Concerta 90mg each day. They were like magic beans. I was no longer depressed and able to gain clarity through the foggy  haze that I'd have in my head. I began to gain my confidence and went bk into the world if work. However  due to personal issues jobs were short lived. But I'd continue to get another job and so on. I literally went downstairs and received this letter today as I Sat 14th March. I feel like a complete waste as I don't have the amount. It's a lot yes but in the sense to become homeless over it feels like a real shame. I mean people reach tens of thousands I am £2897.22 in arrears. Like I said from the very beginning  I cannot believe I am doing this... But I rather fail having tried then failed having never asked for help. At this point my pride is laid down. I will sincerely be greatful for any help you can provide/assist me with.. Please  please share my story  that will be much appreciated too. I'M JUST A NORMAL PERSON. I want to say God bless you from now for your grace and kind hearts. The Lord is all seeing and all knowing and your support will manifest back to you by ten folds. Thankyou in advance for the love and I promise to keep you all updated. With good news  in God's will. Xxx",True

After a long battle with mental health  he was advised by doctors to take time off work but this caused arguments with his wife and the eventual end of their relationship. Darren has been on the streets ever since.    Darren spends most of his time outside the Tesco next to Central Village (university halls) in Leeds. He doesn't beg  cause a fuss or take any substances. After several friendly interactions  a few of my friends and I have been helping ensure he is safe and giving him as much support as we can. He's registered with a hostel in Leeds as homeless and can get a night's stay and breakfast for about £5 a night. However  there is only so much we can do as students.    Our Goal    We've learnt so much from Darren  he's shown us more care and appreciation than many people doing far better than him. Through this GoFundMe we hope to give him a head-start in getting back on his feet and give him the fresh start in life that he deserves. 86% of homeless people report problems with their mental health and Darren is part of this shocking statistic. Rates of homelessness in the UK are rising at an alarming rate  so we're hoping that this campaign will show people that a little means a lot to people in these circumstances. Please help us by just doing a little  even if that's the most you can do.    How will we use the money?    The money donated on this page will go towards buying Darren fresh clothes  a haircut and hopefully a more permanent living situation. Even if he just has enough to stay in the hostel more nights than not  he would be unbelievably grateful.

Do you have a support network to catch you if you fall?  How many pay cheques are *you* from homelessness?    My name is Laura Kidd - I’m an independent musician based in Bristol releasing music under the name She Makes War  and today I’m writing to ask for your help raising money to get Anthony the homeless poet off the streets and fund his dream of helping other people in his position.    Last Wednesday I was in Bristol city centre early to go to the Post Office before work. Walking along near Castle Park  I gave £5 to a man sitting on the pavement near Starbucks  and found myself drawn into conversation with him. A trained chef  on the streets after losing his job and attached accommodation  he had a notebook set out in front of him. Anthony had started trying to make sense of his situation by writing poems about the people he was meeting throughout the day. Despite having had his bag stolen (containing his work clothes  phone  bank cards and ID) he seemed unbelievably relaxed and philosophical but it was bitterly cold outside and I thought about him all morning  kicking myself for not giving him enough money to at least spend the night in a hostel.    At lunchtime I hurried back to see if Anthony was still there  keen to find out if there were any practical things I could do to help. Giving money to people for hostels or food feels better and more direct than going through other channels  but is only ever a sticking plaster for a much bigger problem. He was happy to see me again and I sat down on the step with him for a while  talking everything through. Anthony is only recently homeless  having just returned to Bristol from working in another city. He doesn’t do drugs  doesn’t even drink much  and feels safer sleeping in a doorway on a busy street than in a hostel. He’s also saving money from public donations to buy new chef’s whites so he can work  so doesn’t want to “waste” the cash he’s given on accommodation as it’s so incredibly hard to save up any meaningful amount. I was surprised to hear that £215 - an achievable sum of money for someone in employment to save up relatively quickly - would cover all the clothing and equipment he’d need  but of course that was only one of the issues keeping Anthony out in the cold.    I asked what the main barriers were to him getting back into work and he said two: his lack of work clothes  and somewhere to have a shower and sleep so he can be presentable for work. Having no address means it’s way harder to apply for a new bank card and ID  impossible to get a mobile phone contract…simple things we take for granted. Without somewhere to stay he can’t keep a job  and without a job he can’t get the money to get a place to live. What a cruel catch-22.    On Thursday and Friday nights I took my live band along to Manchester’s Deaf Institute and Bristol’s The Exchange to support alt rock band Lonely The Brave. I’d given Anthony my number and asked him to send me a wish list of things that would be useful to him. I knew a smartphone would enable him to start looking for work  so my husband Tim dusted off an old one from a drawer and I arranged to pass it on that Friday along with a rucksack and a new toothbrush. We’d also talked quite a bit about poetry and performance  and Anthony had said he wanted to get on stage one day  so it was a simple thing to invite him to come along to the Bristol gig and read a couple of his poems at the end of my set. I wanted to share the platform I’ve carved out for myself from a position of relative privilege with someone who was currently reduced to being ignored by thousands of people every day.    Despite having never read his poetry on stage before  Anthony aced it. I’m so grateful to Lonely The Brave’s audience for being so welcoming and encouraging  and there was a real beauty and power to watching this humble man command the full attention of nearly 200 people. After the gig we managed to raise about £80 to go towards replacing Anthony’s work clothes  and a couple took him home with them that night so he could get a proper night’s sleep and have a shower.    We met up again the next day to talk about what could happen next. Though Anthony continued to ask for absolutely nothing  I decided to pay to put him up in a private hostel room for 7 nights to give him time to rest  regroup and have a chance to take the next steps towards getting his life back. I just couldn't bear the thought of someone I was becoming friends with laying his head in a doorway to sleep. It’s my belief that a quiet  private  clean living space is a basic human right and it felt good to do something meaningful for someone. Unfortunately I’m not in a position to do anything more than this financially  which is why I’m turning to you.    We can’t help everyone  but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t help anyone. I’m not a religious person  but I have the phrase “There but for the grace of God go I” on a loop in my mind at the moment. If we truly let ourselves feel all the pain and sadness in the world we wouldn’t be able to function  so of course it’s easier to lower our eyes and scurry past the person asking us for help. It can feel hard enough to balance our own financial lives without even starting to think about other people  but if Anthony’s story has touched you at all I would really appreciate your donation  big or tiny.    In his own words:    ""So I found myself on the streets  not for the first time in my life. Hopefully the last  but one cannot always know what with possible down turns in economy  redundancy etc. Something that could happen to anyone really.    What brought me here? Well  at 13 I was on the streets for a year or so. Luckily it’s equipped me for this recent outing! Basically from a broken violent home I went into Care. This didn’t define who I was  just what hand I was dealt.    At 16 I went into a kitchen and found I had a gift. I love food - like music it can bring the masses together in a harmony of flavours (or sounds). Throughout my life I have also enjoyed words  of the poetry kind. But never really followed it through.    Anyway  back to why I’m here. Basically  I lost a dear person who meant a lot to me last year. Depression hit  I was frivolous with money and didn’t care for the next day. Being self employed and having my accommodation tied to my job  I lost my job. Which then meant I lost my flat.    I found myself on the streets of Bristol. Having my bag stolen on night one left me without my uniforms or tools to work let alone a change of clothes or a phone! I have since had a total retake on how I view people  the world and life. I have found my love for poetry and embraced it  and have been lucky to have had the chance to share it.    I so badly want to return to work. My dream which keeps me positive is to have a barge or boat  which can ultimately be a bistro by night or cafe by day  with the profits going to then feed the homeless. Or even to franchise/rent a cafe in the evening when not in use so we could use it to make money to use the profits to feed the homeless. My situation may seem severe but I believe that me going back to work will also potentially blossom into something many more people will benefit from.     I believe in the goodness of fellow humans. If we all take 5 minutes of our days to put into society  not to just the homeless but the old lady down the road or the lonely guy next door with no friends  a smile to a fellow person or five mins chatting to a stranger that looks upset.    We have a duty to give  not ignore. To build the society we live in from the inside out. Bristol is unique and gorgeous. Just think of how good we could really make it.    Anthony.""    Anthony’s wish list:    “Just basic list really  things to start work  general living things. I put glasses as I had mine in my bag. And struggling without them. Humble but would get me back into a job earning again.”    Work uniform  3 jackets £50  2 trousers £40  4 aprons £25  Shoes £50  Knives £50    Clothing  3 jeans £45  3 t-shirts £15  Underwear £15  Jumper £10    Glasses £80    = £380    If we could raise £500 it could cover all Anthony’s basic needs to get back into work plus give him a nice treat of a year’s supply of Moleskines so he can keep writing poetry (12 x £10 = £120).    BUT without somewhere to stay while applying for jobs it will be impossible for Anthony to stay off the streets  so I’m also hoping to raise more money to keep him safe in his private hostel room for a few weeks. When I first suggested this crowdfunder to him  he said he just wants to be able to get a job  save up and make a plan to settle somewhere  but after a few days of safety and security in the hostel he's feeling more ambitious and has already started setting up meetings to make his dream to feed the homeless a reality. It's inspiring to see. I truly value the time we've spent together over the past week and just hope I can help get him back on his feet.    Thank you so much for reading. If you’re able and happy to donate - thank you again! As Anthony doesn't currently have access to his bank account he's asked me to deal with the donations to start with  the first batch of which will be used to secure temporary accommodation for him right away.    Finally  if you know of any jobs or accommodation in Bristol which might be suitable for Anthony  we’d love to hear from you. Let’s bring someone in from the cold this winter.

The money raised will be used to purchase winter warmer essentials such as  thermal hats  gloves  scarfs and thick socks for shelter-less individuals struggling to survive this icy-cold weather.     I will be purchasing these items from a reputable wholesaler which means a sizeable scope of people will be kept warm this winter and I will be personally distributing them around the streets of London every fortnight.     I will be making packages for each individual which will include FOUR items (1x thinsulate thermal hat  1x thinsulate thermal glove  1x thermal scarf & 1x thermal sock). Each package will cost me approximately £6.     Just for your reassurance  this is a non-profit page therefore all money raised will be used to purchase more stock for packages.     Whilst we are privileged to have a roof over our head  warm meals  heating and warm clothes  there are thousands of people who don’t.

She is so cheerful and hopeful and always tries to help passersby - she gave me a sandwich once when I came out without my purse.  I have started this GoFundMe campaign to try and help her to raise enough so that she can put down a deposit and have at least enough to cover her rent for the first month or so.  If she has an address  she could do so much. She was studying for a business qualification when she was kicked out of her house by her previous landlord because the benefits system has changed here in the UK.    It is getting colder and colder and it is unbearable to think that a young person with so much life inside them and so much hope in their eyes is reduced to sitting on a blanket  shivering and begging  and sleeping in a tent at night  in a grave yard. I really think that if she could find herself back in a house  or even in a room  that would mean one less person is lost. She knows that I'm starting this campaign for her.   That is not her in the picture - I wouldn't do that to her  but she has tried all the ways of pulling herself back up and she is on all sorts of waiting lists.     If you can possibly help  by donating even the price of a cup of coffee that would be enormously appreciated.  I will top up with anything else she needs and would make sure that the funds go towards housing for her.    Please let's help to get her into the warm by Christmas.",True

I cannot stop smiling and it has really being truly overwhelming for us both  it’s something I could not possibly express enough gratitude for. Ashley Alexander whose idea it was to come up with this fundraiser  has tirelessly worked to try and promote this cause over the last few weeks and he feels this is the perfect opportunity to make a difference. Going back to the initial shared post on my Facebook page of myself giving away the trainers  we realised that so many other people’s personal experiences with Derek mirror ours. This convinced us  that we can use this moment as a community to do even more for this very nice and pleasant individual. This GoFundMe page has been setup to see if we could all go one step further for Derek and raise enough money to enable him to put down a deposit and try to get a roof over his head for this winter  the most difficult period of the year for the homeless. Ashley has been working hard over the last few weeks behind the scenes contacting local authorities to see how we can assist this man in regards to gaining an accommodation.      I have seen Derek regularly on the streets for the last 2-3 years in our town of Ipswich and through it all he has always had a smile on his face despite his perilous situation. During this time  I have always wondered to myself  what I could do  if anything to help him get out of his situation. It would mean more than the world to me  if we can work together and achieve this target to allow him to get a fresh start in his life. Every time I see him  he makes me and everyone else feel good about themselves by way of his compliments and positivity  which I  and others genuinely appreciate and this was the motivation of my gesture towards him the other day. We know we cannot help everyone in the world but if we could start by just helping this one  it would make everything that has happened in the last few days all worth it!!!    I want to clarify our intentions in raising the funds for Derek and how we are planning to use it. We are getting in contact with Derek's support worker and the local authorities so we can provide clear updates and transparency to all our donor's with regards to where exactly their money is going and we will provide receipts of every penny that gets spent. We will initially support Derek with engaging with the local authority and relevant agencies so he can get the best outcome possible. Once he has been allocated an accommodation  the donations will go towards his deposit and ensure that his months upfront rent is paid. Remaining funds will then go towards providing him with things like bed sheets and furniture – if needed. If we go over our target for Derek  we will donate the remaining donations to regional charities such as FIND (Families in Need)  Emmaus  Ipswich Locality Homelessness Project (ILHP) who all do a brilliant job in providing support to those who are most vulnerable. We are going to reach out to these charities in the coming weeks  so they are aware of our movement. These charities support trying to combat the issue of homelessness by means of providing food parcels  furniture and support funding emergency accommodation which is going to be crucial in the upcoming months.

We began with 2 women walking the streets with a flask and biscuits unsure if they would see any homeless people  but they did  too many in fact.    It soon became obvious what these people needed.... they needed other people!!    Our aim has always been to build relationships built on trust  this has taken time and a lot of commitment but we are now heavily involved and accepted within the homeless community.    we support people on a daily basis meeting basic needs of food  warm clothing  sleeping bags and whatever else is needed.    Following on from this we have been privileged to get to know people and the stories behind what brought someone to the lowest point of their life.    We now support in many different ways  we have helped people gain employment  permanent accomadation  reunite with estranged family members.    We also have helped people access support through the mental health sector  going to appointments with people who have been too afraid to seek out help alone.    We managed to help signpost people to residential rehabilitation centres so to begin the first steps in their journey of building their life back together.    We have had many success stories with people now in full time employment and education  some have their own homes.    We have also had some very sad  heartbreaking stories  we have lost too many friends along the way to pneumonia  poor living conditions  suicide and hyperthermia.    This year we have our annual fundraiser  we only do this once a year because we are not about constantly asking for financial aid  we do of course take donations of clothing  food and other items all year round.    While of course we do receive support in these areas it sometimes isn't enough to meet the high demand so we fundraise once a year in the hope of raising funds to help purchase supplies.    Any help at all will be so greatly appreciated be it a donation of money  supplies or your time volunteering in distributing food etc    If anyone would like to contact us directly then please feel free via our website where you will find all contact details.

We will also use any money for donated to secure accomodation through hostels & bed and breakfasts  because no one deserves to be on the streets especially at winter time.

We are an entirely self funded volunteer led group of like minded local people  young and old  who wanted to do something to help the homeless and needy in our neighbourhood. So in November 2018 we founded the Tooting Community Kitchen. Since then we have run a weekly distribution of hot food  and essential supplies. We now have over 50 volunteers and we have been able to assist hundreds of people........so far!    Currently  every Saturday evening our volunteers are able to provide the following help:    • We distribute food packs to a local shelter for homeless people  • We set up a stall from 6.30pm to 7.30pm next to Tooting Broadway Market where we serve hot food  soups  drinks and hand out toiletries and sanitary products  • Our outreach volunteers visit known places where homeless people sleep in the local community and we provide them with a hot meal  a hot drink  toiletries and sanitary products and sleeping bags  • Our outreach teams are now able to serve people in Wandsworth (Southside area)  Clapham Junction  Putney High Street  and Clapham South / Common / and North.      We urgently need donations so this much needed work can carry in the community.     Please help us to help those in need.      Tooting Community Kitchen",True

We have the skills  resources and a commercial kitchen with the ability to make fresh  healthy meals in bulk and feed a large number of people at cost price.

The Moroccan charity  Open Hands  is a not-for-profit organisation  which runs various volunteering projects to support the community. Projects include supporting orphanages  children and adults with disabilities  delivering activities for children on the streets  and feeding the homeless.     During the holy month of Ramadan  Open Hands runs a food kitchen for the homeless  in Marrakech. Food is provided for 120 homeless people everyday for Iftar  over the 30 days (05/05/19 - 04/06/19). As Ramadan is fast approaching  i am (hopefully) fundraising £800 (10 000 MAD) to fund the feeding homeless project during Ramadan. All money raised goes directly towards buying food and cooking materials for the project.     Last May  i volunteered with Open Hands and supported this project throughout the holy month of Ramadan. All the volunteers at Open Hands do an incredible job and providing food for the homeless community in Marrakech was a very rewarding experience! Please watch the youtube video and see the attached pictures to see just how much of a difference our donations make.     As you can see from the pictures  we have limited resources and feed a vast number of people over the course of the month. It is important that we have enough funds to run the programme successfully. Basic things  such as bowls  plates and plastic cups  are needed as well as food ingredients. If anyone would like to donate or send plastic plates  cups etc. i can take these donations or send you an address.     Thanks in advance everyone! :)    ",True

My name is Natalie Denny and I am an Education and Training Manager from Liverpool. Thank you so much for taking the time to look at The Homeless Period Liverpool fundraising page. Periods are not a great time of the month for any woman  but for homeless women with very limited access to the expensive 'luxury' of sanitary items  it is a truly awful and humiliating time  and because of the taboo that surrounds the topic  it's something that doesn't often cross our mind. Some women are forced to use ripped up cloths  old socks or toilet roll from public toilets  or make a few tampons last the entire length of their period. This can lead to infections  so it doesn't just have an emotional impact but is a danger to women's physical health. This is why I have joined The Homeless Period Team  to supply the women in Liverpool with the items they struggle to get access to. We are all volunteers and will be collecting donations of wipes  underwear and sanitary items and produce female care packages which are delivered to various projects and shelters across the city If you would like to help  you can donate here. We will also be setting up donation stations and will provide the address to send donations to once they are confirmed. The money and donations go towards creating our special period care packs  which each contain underwear  wipes  and a selection of sanitary products. These packs will be going out to other homeless charities and projects in Liverpool to make a difference for as many women as possible who are in difficult circumstances  allowing their dignity and health to be maintained through their periods. Thank you again for visiting our page. We are incredibly grateful for the support and donations given to our cause no matter how big or small! Natalie  <3 ",True

A group of volunteers will be cooking and serving the dinner on Christmas eve and spending some time with the individuals who will be attending the dinner and hopefully help them create some lovely Christmas memories.     We are looking to raise £250 to primarily pay for the ingredients  however if we exceed our target  we will be putting together some care packages to give out to a few people around London who will be sleeping on the streets.     Please give whatever you can  even if our target is not met  Wooden Spoon LDN will be matching what is raised to still make the Christmas dinner at the Dennis Handfield House possible.       Some background information:   Rough sleeping and homelessness has become a crisis in London. The number of rough sleepers has increased by 1 371 totaling over 8 000 people in the year ending March 2019. Furthermore  the homeless experience a wide range of issues such as lack of food  drink  shelter  medical care and sanitation products.     Many people tend to spend time with the friends and family during Christmas. However  those who are homeless often go without some of the pleasures many experience during the festive period. #FeedingLDN aims to provide those who are homeless with food  water and other daily essentials as well as some kind words to ensure that they do not go without food and love during the festive period.       Thank you for taking the time to read this  and thank you for your donations!     Merry Christmas :)    Here are some photos from last year’s #FeedingLDN     http://www.woodenspoonldn.co.uk/csr",True

This whole project started off as a few friends getting together to make a few meals but thanks to your help we have the resources to make this something really amazing. So we've decided to postpone this until the new year when we've had time to properly organise the money to make sure we're making the most of it.

My beautiful friend and her lovely child are being made homeless from a domestic violence refuge in 2 weeks time.     They have exhausted all options in fighting this  minus a legal challenge which would be costly  time consuming and utterly draining on a traumatised and exhausted mum. So the funds are for two things - to provide a suitable short term let  and to help fund a preloved static caravan so they have some stability and peace while she can contemplate her next (long term) move.     They have been in a number of refuge accommodation for 3 years now after having to flee their home from domestic violence. They have been 2 years with the same council and have been on the waiting list for housing in that time. They are still not close to getting a council or HA home due to the excessive demand in the area.       They have been offered a room in a hostel  with shared facilities which is wholly unsuitable due to disabilities and health issues that they both have  this has been backed up by occupational therapists and paediatric consultants. Social services have also admitted this is not suitable but there is nothing else they will provide for them.     They have also been told they cannot bring her son’s cat. For a traumatised autistic child this just isn’t an option my friend can contemplate.     Private landlords will not even consider her due to one or all of needing possible future adaptations for disabilities  a pet  housing benefit. She also needs a very long term landlord due to these health issues and they both just need some stability and somewhere they can lay down roots.     I would be so grateful if you could help  it breaks my heart everyday to see this happening to them and not being able to do anything meaningful about it. I know once they have been able to heal from this awful period in their lives that my friend will give back in so many ways. She has a lot of insight into the way we as a country treat our most vulnerable.     Thank you.     For their safety I cannot share any information about their location.",True

The latest official numbers show around an 130% increase in Rough Sleeping and more than double the numbers managing to get into some sort of temp or emergency accommodation where homeless often struggle because of the lack of normal household items  we are providing these essential items as part of our remit. These items sometimes are as simple as plates and cutlery but sometimes we provide microwaves  radios and even TV's which encourage the clients to spend more time in their rooms making it easier to engage with services and keeping them away from the dangers on the streets. We also supply food drops giving them a start till their benefits catch up.    New shelters alongside the established ones are helping more this year than ever but they still for whatever reason between them only cover less than half of the rough sleepers  we are servicing the rest approx 120. On top we are providing a weekly full meal alongside clothing and provisions to the many who for whatever reason will not engage with the more established services.    Our commitment to working towards a solution for homelessness could not be more evident as is our ability to provide a free and unrestricted service to some of the hardest or most vulnerable in the city  we turn no one away.    We would formally like to request consideration for a funding grant from either the Homeless Support Funds or/and Prevention of Homeless Funds. An award would see us safely through to the end of winter period and we have estimated the increase in extra provisions will leave us having to find approx £9400 to cover running costs till then.

I'm currently in a crisis as I'm being threatened of being kicked out from the place I'm currently living at. My landlord is a live-in landlord and has made many sexually uncomfortable remarks towards (making me extremely uncomfortable and I can't involve the police as we don't have an official contract so he can evict me at any time causing my immediete homelessness) me as well as been racist towards me and my friends who are also coloured.  I'm at the verge of entering homelessness again and am extremely desperate and need your help.    As some of you know I don't have a secure biological family and fend for myself so I literally have nobody.    I'm trying to raise 1000 which will be enough for a deposit for a room as well as for a month's worth of rent.    Please help me  I appreciate it so much.    I love you    Tai",True

Sadly  not everybody is able to do that. There are still thousands of homeless people living in Scotland  many of whom are living on the streets  with others living in unsanitary  cramped accommodations  where distancing is not an option. There are also many people facing uncertainty within their own homes  as thousands across the country lose their incomes and begin to struggle to pay rent and mortgages. Shelter works to change this  providing advice and help to those in need  from legal advice to setting up accommodation. They also campaign with and against local authorities and the government  to protect against and change systematic injustice.   I don’t think it’s any secret that Shelter is a cause that has been very close to my heart for the last few years  (in fact i’m sure some of you are sick of me going on about it)  but I am once again asking for your help.   Anyone who knows me knows I have been growing my hair for the past 5 years  and it is now reaching almost my mid back. If we are able to raise £200 for Shelter  I will cut my hair. I’ll also do so on video  to further the pain!   Please  please help me to achieve this. No one should be living without a suitable home  or with the uncertainty of whether they will be able to keep their home  in times like this.   Once the goal of £200 is reached  I will be doing a stream on Facebook Live of me losing my beautiful flowing locks  so you all know I have held up my end of the bargain  so please look out for that!

He isn’t entitled to any benefits as he has no fixed address and no bank account no family for support! If we could raise first months rent this is a massssssiveeee good start for him!

Chris donates his 1ps and 2ps to the charity shops and he has absolutely nothing to give if he can donate so can we!

There is a huge problem in Kullu and Bhuntar with homeless children who are not going to school  at all. As such  they are completely trapped in a spiral of deprivation  as they cannot acquire skills to help them get work  and therefore they cannot earn money to ""move on"".    Alongside the voluntary teaching in schools that i have been doing  i have now set up 2 ""Street Schools"". These are basic  very basic indeed. So far  this consists of evening ""classes"" for a little over 150 children per week.    I need money for 3 things. Firstly  i want to expand the scope of these two provisions to cover 4 additional slum areas locally. Secondly  i would like to provide a very basic hot meal to children. And thirdly  i want to continue to provide the very basics of eduction to the children. This would include exercise books  pencils  pencil cases  and some simple reading books.    Please help. Even if you have helped before  please see it in your heart to help again. I cannot begin to describe either the level of need that exists  or the tangible difference that this work is already making. Seeing children smile that otherwise have nothing to smile about in life should make YOU  you generous people  feel that you are part of what i want to achieve.    The lives that some children live is beyond comprehension. Together  we can create a provision that could change that for years to come around here.     I will continue to throw all my effort  available cash  and the preverbial ""kitchen sink"" at this.     Please  be part of it. All my love xx",True
