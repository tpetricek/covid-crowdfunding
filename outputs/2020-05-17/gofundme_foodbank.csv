SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK. 

1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR, to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.

I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food, distributing it, identifying that I was struggling and helping me out. 

And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.

As the impact of coronavirus takes hold, and the knock on effect of unpaid work, unfulfilled contracts, zero hours workers getting literally zero hours, new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay, who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!), More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank, only to find that their shelves are empty too.

It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.

People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.

We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy, society, communities. But poverty is already isolating, lonely, and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves, more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.

All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.

If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free. Thankyou for your support.

The Trussell Trust, in conjunction with local communities, develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need, providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.

Our family were in awe by his altruistic desire to give, feed and aid ALL, despite race/ethnicity/religion among him even whilst suffering himself.

 Since opening, our family alone have vetted 25 families with monthly food rations from December 2019- present. Unfortunately, 25 families do not cover the innumerable amount of people starving, for whom we want to share some light, hope and nurture to amidst dark times, that is their indefinite reality.

Our foodbank prioritises poor families with children, single mothers/widowers and those who themselves or their children suffer with debilitating mental/physical health issues trying to make ends meet to provide for their children- this is done with rigorous checks by our team to ensure nobody exploits such a service. The families are issued with a monthly ration card valid for 12 months which provides them with stock for each month as per the individual needs of the family. These include: 10kg chapati flour (atta), 5kg sugar, 5kg various lentils/daal, 5kg rice, 5L cooking oil, tea leaves, salt, spices and other necessary food items. £25 will feed a family of 5 for the month however any donation, no matter how big or small will impact them greatly. 

100% of the donationsgo to those in need, with our incredible staff being voluntary workers (so no wages or salaries are deducted from donations) and our facilities funded with the finances that the late Safdar Hussain Shah left behind for us to carry this out in his legacy- we are relying on your kind donations which will solely provide stock for the families. 

During the current COVID-19 crisis, we are aiming to try and provide emergency food supplies to all those suffering in the locale, with the most vulnerable holding priority, we are giving out thousands of food rations but are broken to see that we are unable to extend our help to everyone that needs it- as a small start-up charity, we are grateful for all the support and donations we receive in order to help us reach as many individuals suffering from the crisis as possible. 

Unfortunately, we can't do this alone, with the power of unity together we can help fill the stomachs of the poor, not only with food but also the fulfilment of life and hope they may gradually receive from your donations. Our brothers and sisters around the globe need us, we are united by our efforts. 
Any donation, no matter how big or small will be greatly appreciated especially in the blessed month of Ramadan, whereby charity is considered its greatest. 

We are not the givers, we are just Allah SWT, the Almighty's, servants and can only give what he allows and wishes to be given. The families we aim to feed is by the grace of Allah SWT and it is he who provides to all. 

May Allah SWT accept this from you and me, may we fulfil our duty by helping those in need, for which it is their right upon you and I.

So in today's tough times so many people during the Covid 19 pandemic, are finding many great ways to raise funds, for those less fortunate.
Currently, there is a huge need to help support the food banks, as so many people are needing additional help, to put food on the table, which is where the idea came from.

Many people leading up to the bank holiday would be planning where they are going to stay overnight camping or in their vans or on holiday, sadly for the VE-Day weekend that can no longer happen. So why dont we celebrate at home ?

So the idea is simple plan your trip based at home, prepare everything you need to go camping, stay overnight on the drive in your van, a tent in your garden, or even in your house (but it must be set up like a camping trip), or in your caravan. 

So how do we raise funds ? 
Donate a minimum of £5 in the pot or the amount you would normally have paid for a night camping at your favourite spot during the bank holiday weekend.
If local to Nailsea, the money will go to food bank in Nailsea, if not to the national food bank network, every £ will make a difference.

Its not just about fundraising, so let's have some fun, go to town decorating your place of accommodation, take pictures, upload them to the Facebook page, use your imagination to have an amazing night or more 'away at home!'"

"Donate Tin Can Cook to foodbanks","Southend-on-Sea, East of England, United Kingdom",https://www.gofundme.com/f/donate-tin-can-cook-to-foodbanks,44606,30000,2020-04-20T10:36:04.0000000-05:00,11/01/2018,,,1000,"PLEASE SEE UPDATE SECTION FOR IMPORTANT UPDATE - IT'S VERY GOOD NEWS! :)

I'm Jack Monroe, and in 2011-2013 I lived in desperate poverty. I was eventually referred to a food bank, where I survived for six months on kindness and donated tins and packets. I started to write about my experiences online, and haven't stopped since. I now write cookery books teaching people to cook on the smallest of budgets and smallest of kitchens. I work with food banks, charities, homelessness shelters, and campaign against austerity and for decent jobs and wages. 

Tin Can Cook is my fourth cookbook, and I insisted on writing it, partly as an entry-level cookbook for people who have never learned to cook, but mostly to restore some dignity to a food bank box. To give people choices, and agency, and good food, and resources. Tin Can Cook is a book of 75 easy, fun, delicious recipes, made from tin cans! Recipes include Carrot Cake Overnight Oats from a tin of carrots, Tinned Spud Fishcakes, a Chicken And Ham Pie, lots of curries, Cherry Chocolate Fudge, and how to cook pasta from a kettle or microwave. Tin Can Cook has received a lot of encouragement since it was first announced, with Jay Rayner from the Guardian describing it as 'both a brilliant thing and necessary', and support from Tom Parker Bowles, Ryan Riley from LifeKitchen, Nigella Lawson, and an article in the Telegraph.

I have donated my previous books to food banks and told them they can photocopy the pages to hand out to their clients, and they have done so in their thousands. I have made thousands of recipe cards to hand out to food bank users in conjunction with Oxfam and the Trussell Trust. But I want to do more.

I want this book to reach as many people as it needs to. I'm not in this to make money - the royalties for an author are laughably piteous, 7-10% of the RRP - so this isn't about flogging books. It's about giving people hope, dignity, and decent meals in the most dire of situations. And you can help.

At the moment, the retail price for Tin Can Cook is £6.99. I also need to factor in postage, packaging, and administrative costs. (I have done a Kickstarter before and ended up personally very out of pocket for not accurately factoring in postage costs, so I am being over cautious with my calculations, as it is better to overdeliver than disappoint. If I do find a way to get around the postage costs to deliver to approximately 400 different locations, I will donate the difference directly to the Trussell Trust and let you know).

I am also in conversation with corporate sponsors to see if they would match the books donated by you, which would be fantastic!

So, with postage, admin costs, packaging, and all that nonsense, at the moment I estimate that for every £9 raised, one book and three tins will be donated to a foodbank. (If this changes for any reason, and it shouldn't, I will let you know).

Books will be evenly distributed throughout the Trussell Trust network of food banks across the whole of the UK - you can find the areas that they cover here: https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/find-a-foodbank/ (but it's pretty much all of them!)

And what do I get out of this? Well to be honest, not much at all. But that's not what I'm doing it for. I wish I was rich enough to just donate a million books for every food bank user in Britain, every family in poverty, every school, every library, but I just earn the Living Wage (yes, really) and some months even that's a bit hairy, so I can't do this by myself. But you can help. 

I know £9 is a lot of money to some people, so pledges start at £5, meaning you can co-fund a book with another donor. For every £9 raised, one book and three tins will be donated to a food bank, and they will go to a family or a person who would be at risk of starving without emergency food help.

For my backstory, click here: https://cookingonabootstrap.com/2012/07/30/hunger-hurts/

Every penny raised will go towards making a real difference, so thankyou for your help.

The Trussell Trust currently operate 420 food banks across the UK. Here's a breakdown of where the money raised here will go.

If we raise £3,780, every Trussell Trust food bank in the UK can receive one copy of Tin Can Cook to photocopy and hand out the photocopies to their clients - I've waived the copyright for food banks, they can copy it to their hearts content. I did this with previous books and foodbank managers said it made a real difference. And 1260 tins of food will be donated across the UK to feed people in need.

If we raise £7,560, every Trussell Trust food bank in the UK will receive two copies of the book, and 2,520 tins of food will be donated.

If we raise £37,800, every TT food bank in the UK will receive ten copies of Tin Can Cook, to distribute to 4,200 food bank users, and 12,600 tins of food will be donated across the UK to feed people who would be at risk of going hungry otherwise.

To give a book and a parcel of tins to every food bank user in Britain, we would need to raise around £7m. So every donation counts. Every single donation counts. If you can't afford to donate, please share on your social media instead - it's free! 

If you have any further questions, or for press enquiries, please get in touch on thetincancook@gmail.com and I or my admin angel, Caroline, will get back to you.

Thanks again for your support - I know this book would have made a real difference to me on the breadline, and I want to make that difference for other people.

It is more important than ever that we work together to support one another. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund has launched to provide support to those most at need in our community. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund Right now many of us are understandably feeling anxious and vulnerable, but there are many among us that need immediate support in order to ensure that they can have access to food. Greenwich residents have a proud history of looking after one another - and never has this been more important than now. So I have been working with Greenwich Food Bank to create the Greenwich Food Bank Fund. As the borough faces one of its most important challenges in living memory, the Fund has been set up to ensure that those in need across the borough have access to the help they need. Please, even during this most difficult of times, we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Greenwich. Please be assured that even the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference. Thank you for your generosity. FAQs Where will the funds go? The funds will go directly to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by the Greenwich Food Bank and delivered to food banks across the borough, from Blackheath to Eltham, Kidbrooke, Thamesmead and beyond. A full list of food bank locations is available at https://greenwich.foodbank.org.uk/locations/. If I donate will it go directly to those who need it? Yes, your donation will go directly to Greenwich Food Bank. Unlike some other platforms, GoFundMe does not charge a fundraising fee although it takes a small transaction fee. See https://www.gofundme.com/c/free-fundraising for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to. Will the money be spent in Greenwich? Yes. Is there anything else I can do? The most immediate need is to raise finance, so that purchasing can continue. However there is also a need to: (1) donate food where possible; and (2) create a team of delivery drivers as the Food Bank moves to a delivery model. If you are able to help with either of these, please email contact@greenwichfoodbank.co.uk. Where can I find more information about Covid-19?

But the coronavirus epidemic will be a massive challenge for them, on a whole new scale. More and more people are going to need their help over the next few months.

People on zero hours contracts won't get paid.

Food will need to be delivered to the elderly and sick who are self-isolating.

If schools close, many children will lose their main meal and need to be fed.

And all this is happening at a time when the rest of us are going to the supermarket less and - let's be honest - thinking about our own food cupboards first.

So, here's a very simple way to help. You give money. Every time we get to £100 I ask the foodbank what they need most and go and get it. If things get really bad, I will organise a delivery. We all keep doing this over and over again until things get better.


Why aren't Fair Frome doing this? Well, they've got a heck of a lot on their plate right now and this is one way I can take the load off them. It's also easier for me to set up a fundraiser as an individual.

Who am I anyway? Good question, I have volunteered for the food bank before, and here I am with Lenka, their co-ordinator, in the food bank. Fair Frome know that I am making this appeal and are very happy to have the fundraising happen.


I will post the receipt on here every time I go shopping.

But if you're still worried, please do take some food to the Fair Frome collection points in Sainsburys, Asda, Frome Wholefoods and Barnardos instead. 


Frome is a great community. Let's channel this and do our best to see all our town through the next few months.

ABOUT
“The foodbank was there when we really needed it, it was an absolute lifeline.”

We don’t think anyone in our community should have to face going hungry. That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks, supported by The Trussell Trust, working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.

ABOUT OUR FOODBANK
An introduction to the Morecambe Bay Foodbank project.
Morecambe Bay Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups, working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. It began life at the GYM Church on Green Street in Morecambe and has now moved to The West End Community Centre on Westminster Road in Morecambe. We receive and distribute over six tonnes of food each month and our operation has been growing since its inception in 2012. 

We have a small staff team led by our Foodbank Manager, Annette Smith, and over eighty regular volunteers who give up their time to help us each week.

ABOUT
HOW FOODBANKS WORK
Providing emergency food to people in crisis.
Every day people in the UK go hungry for reasons ranging from redundancy to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. A simple box of food makes a big difference, with foodbanks helping prevent crime, housing loss, family breakdown and mental health problems.

FOOD IS DONATED
Schools, churches, businesses and individuals donate non-perishable, in-date food to a foodbank. Large collections often take place as part of Harvest Festival celebrations and food is also collected at supermarkets.

FOOD IS SORTED AND STORED
Volunteers sort food to check that it’s in date and pack it into boxes ready to be given to people in need. Over 40,000 people give up their time to volunteer at foodbanks.

PROFESSIONALS IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN NEED
Foodbanks partner with a wide range of care professionals such as doctors, health visitors, social workers and police to identify people in crisis and issue them with a foodbank voucher.

CLIENTS RECEIVE FOOD
Foodbank clients bring their voucher to a foodbank centre where it can be redeemed for three days’ emergency food. Volunteers meet clients over a warm drink or free hot meal and are able to signpost people to agencies able to solve the longer-term problem."

Bevendean Foodbank serves Bevendean, Moulsecoome, AND Coldean. This is a huge area for a weekly Foodbank. With the current COVID-19 situation, Kate recently attended an emergency food meeting for Moulsecoomb and Bevendean. The upshot is that Bevendean Food bank may have to close Fear not, though, as The Bevendean Cooperative Pub has closed as a pub and is now the identified main hub for the area in the Council's city wide emergency food plan. They will be coordinating deliveries of both food parcels and cooked food. They urgently needed funds to buy in initial supplies, to undertake a deep clean, to retain staff and, really urgently, to buy containers for cooked meals. This is why I have donated £1000 of this GoFundMe to them to enable to them hit the ground running and keep this vital support going during these unpredictable times. This does, of course, leave the GoFundMe in its last few hundred pounds. I have seen a spike in donations since Monday which is amazing and thank you all so much for your continued support. I am asking that you share this GoFundMe around as MANY PLACES AS YOU CAN so we can continue to support as many people as possible. Donating money to the fund is more helpful, and safer, than donating food. I can buy in bulk with more money and get better deals. I work closely with the Foodbank to get a list of the items they desperately need which ensures they are stocked with the right things all the time. I am not an “at risk” person so having just me out and about collecting and dropping food is safer than having many people donating. Thank you, once again, to everyone who donated the first time around and who is donating now. I couldn’t have done any of this without you all ❤️"

Also feedback from some healthcare workers is that they really appreciate the public support, but feel well-paid. So they would like people to help those less well-off in our community.

I am running the Liverpool half marathon in March in support of South Liverpool Foodbank. Why have I chosen this particular cause? Here are some numbers...

- More than 11,000 people used SL Foodbank last year
- One in three children in Liverpool are growing up in poverty. In some areas of the city region, that rises above 50%.
- In the 2019 Indices of Deprivation, Liverpool ranked 2nd in England for highest proportion of neighbourhoods classed among the 10% most deprived nationally.

Food banks really shouldn't have to exist, but we have a government in this country which systematically perpetuates poverty and inequality, so sadly they're an absolute necessity for millions of people to live. 

It might be 21km worth of pain on the day, but it will be for a very important and worthwhile cause. Anything you can give is greatly appreciated.

‘Let’s Eat’ Community Foodbank 
Help us feed our Leeds community in the COVID-19 crisis Why are we asking for help?:
Chapeltown Youth Development Centre have identified a need to launch a new, weekly foodbank in Leeds 7 in direct response to the Coronavirus pandemic. Our local community urgently needshelp and support to tackle one of the very basic but very real challenges they are facing; that of feeding their families. 

Some young people and their families live in poverty all year round, but we are finding, because of the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, so many more are contacting us because they’re struggling with increased pressures on their household budgets. People who are battling with job losses, reduction in their incomes, wait times/not being eligible to receive benefits, an increase in utility bills etc during lockdown and ultimately children that go hungry. There are also vulnerable people in our community that need help; ie elderly, disabled, those shielding for health reasons or in self isolation who haven’t got anyone else to help them. We know these impacts will be felt long term.

Every penny you donate counts. It will help us achieve our foodbank project’s aims of reducing food poverty and inequality. It will help us tackle some of the very real challenges young people, the disadvantaged and vulnerable in our community are facing right now. Alternatively, you may have or work at a business that can offer us some support or help - if you have any ideas around this, please contact us at letseatproject@yahoo.com

We want to make a difference and help families put healthy food on the table, and we are grateful for any help you can give us to make this happen and make something positive come from this difficult time in the longer term. Thank you so much for your support ❤️

A Bit More About Us and ‘Let’s Eat’ Foodbank:
CFYDC (CHANCE) T/A Chapeltown Youth Development Centre are a Leeds based registered charity (No. 1121341). Our focus is on supporting young people to achieve their fullest potential in life. We do this by offering and subsidising a range of positive diversionary activities such as football, rugby, boxing, education and training opportunities and gang prevention work - regardless of background, race, religion, ethnicity, gender, disability etc. We have a high proportion of BAME community members that attend our centre and we work city wide, but have a focus on helping those in Chapeltown and the other most deprived areas surrounding us in North and North-East Leeds. We have been a part of the community we serve for around 20 years so far and have supported thousands of kids. We only plan for growth so that we can support many, many more young people to achieve their aims and become their best!


CYDC have the premises, the volunteers, the will and determination to deliver this project, not just during lockdown but long term so we can truly make a difference. To achieve this though we need your help to raise the funds to buy essential equipment such as suitable fridge/freezers (approx £2500) so we can receive more food and improve the food parcels, to improve our available storage spaces (costs for this are currently being worked up, but to give you an idea we need an extra storage container, shelving/tables/materials/labour etc), cover delivery costs for those that can’t come to us because they’re vulnerable/disabled/elderly/isolating etc, to buy bags, gloves, sanitisers etc and to stock up on food and household goods that families in financial crisis need support with getting at this time. We are working in partnership with FareShare Yorkshire. 
We want to make a community food store that can make a difference. This is a project that we have begun operating immediately to react to this crisis and meet the growing need for help for families to feed themselves, but also one we want to develop, grow and make sustainable in the long term. Locally and nationally the demand for support in communities to reduce food, child, and working poverty is, sadly, an increasing trend with no signs of slowing. We also want to break down some of the social stigmas in the community that are associated with the use of food banks and make it easier for families to get the help they need.

Usually our charity is able to generate some income through some of our already heavily subsidised youth activities (we offer our activity sessions e.g. football, rubgy, boxing etc for £2 a time) - but this has currently come to a crashing halt to keep people safe! Also a lot of the grants and corporate fundraising methods have been put on hold or are under severe strain due to increased demand. We have to find a different way of fundraising during COVID-19 - and let’s just say Captain Tom was an inspiration to us! So here we are, hoping you can offer your support.

Thanks for reading our appeal. If you can’t donate yourself, maybe you can share our story so someone else might help. Either way, we hope you all stay safe, well and blessed! ❤️ "

No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children, but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship, we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment, food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.

The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations, none of it is possible.

Whatever you can give, it all helps.

- We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank, with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.

- On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities, who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland. Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen feed people seven days a week and will now be able to buy pallets of fresh produce to cook with, whilst the foodbank will be able to use the money to produce emergency three day food parcels.

We at CIG are very lucky people, we work for a company that cares for us and pays us and allows us to work from home. 

With the care packages sent out i was thinking that there must be a lot of needy people needing support with food and care during this trying time and rather than sit there and wait for someone to help i decided to start this charity drive to earn a little of money to give to the stockport foodbank charity, they currently have 7 locations in stockport and help all people who are in need of extra, not just during this trying time but always.

Darlington Liberal Democrat Vicky Atkinson has set out raising money in aid of the foodbank ran by King's Church Darlington and every donation will help. 

King's Church is passionate about working in and for the community. They have a foodbank on site that gave out 75,000 meals last year, and given this year's Covid crisis, this is set to increase. 

Vicky Atkinson has arranged for the Liberal Democrats in Darlington and Sedgefield to donate to this amazing cause. Over the past few months we've not been able to leaflet, and canvas support in the same ways as before, as we along with the rest of the country have been obeying social distancing. Instead we have been getting even more involved in community projects around the town. Vicky Atkinson has been coordinating volunteers with Darlington Coronavirus Support, and has seen first hand struggles the people of this town are having during this time, and as a result, the increased pressure on foodbanks. So it makes perfect sense that the money we've not spent on leaflets, that we donate to those foodbanks, allowing us to further take care of those in our community who need the most support. 

Darlington Lib Dems have started the pot with £750, roughly the amount we would have spent on leaflets during this time and are now asking for your support to add to this amazing cause! 

Now that the guidelines on social distancing have altered, this allows us the ability to do even more to help, whilst remaining safe. So over the coming weeks we will be doing various activities to help our community. 

Starting this Saturday when Vicky Atkinson will be meeting her one person from another household, fellow Lib Dem Karen Chapman, on a litter pick around the Hummersknott area.

We'd love it if you could support us, to support Kings Centre Foodbank and donate via our Go Fund Me page. 

Thank you all in advance and stay safe."

As per the Government guidelines regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, they have recently had to close their doors, and has repurposed into a Foodbank in order to ensure that the most vulnerable and at risk members of our community are cared for and looked after.

Working alongside MSB Woolton FC, Hugamug have been working tirelessly in order to provide food parcels, medical supplies and other essentials to hundreds of families across the area during a time of unprecedented difficulty for many.

Unfortunately, due to an administration error, Hugamug has been unable to secure the Governement funded grant which would be needed to allow them to remain functional. Whilst it is hoped that the issue with the Government grand should be rectified soon, it leaves Hugamug in the disastrous situation of being unable to pay their rent for the next month - Something which would in turn leave hundreds of at risk, vulnerable families in our community helpless.

So now we are asking you whether it would be possible for you to donate as much or as little as you could afford in order to help Hugamug continue to do their selfless work.

We are facing an unprecedented challenge and so any donation will be warmly welcomed as we continue to support those people most in need. Many of the primary locations used to donate food to are now closed, there are little or no opportunities to give food directly to the Foodbank BUT they still need stock. 

As the impact of coronavirus takes hold, and the knock on effect of unpaid work, unfulfilled contracts, zero hours workers getting literally zero hours, new universal credit claims, currently a six week delay, who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?. More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank, only to find that their shelves are empty too.

We don't know how COVID-19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy, society, communities. But poverty is already isolating, lonely, and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves, more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.

All the money raised here does directly to Ballycastle Foodbank who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger.

If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free.

The work this school is doing is phenomenal and I feel so privileged to be able to experience this, and I am already looking forward to the next 2 and a half weeks to come!

The object of the project is to teach English to the children in the village, so they have better job prospects than just rice farming, sweatshop work or prostitution. They also run a food bank project, helping some of the poorest families to become self sustainable and giving them food packages that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford.

The last few weeks teaching has been a real eye opener, and one of my highlights so far has been teaching my pre intermediate class all about women’s rights and gender inequality, they are so willing to learn it’s infectious.

I am asking for donations to be able to treat our children on Fun Friday, as lots of them have extremely hard lives and so this fortnightly treat is something they really look forward to! Any remaining money left over from fun Friday will go straight to the food bank project.

They have taken our main hard drive /pc all are password protected . They have obviously ransacked the office and damaged our filing cabinets. Along side the items we need to replace , they have taken around £200 that was donated over the Christmas period which obviously provides much needed funds for the day to day running of the foodbank. Food was taken too, so we are putting an appeal out for tinned fish, rice pudding, tinned fish , tinned tomatoes and uht milk.

Personllay I feel ensuring that foodbanks have adequate food to help the most vulnerable in our community is a priority. 

There are 5 foodbanks in my local area which last year issued 64.1 tonnes of food, the equivalent of 128,000 packs of 500g bags of pasta. They feed 7,669 clients of which 3,065 are children.

My Challenge:
I am a keen cyclist and due to Covid-19 outbreak my usual social and competitive cycles have been impacted. So to keep motivated I am going to attempt to complete 10 back to back training sessions all from my virtual trainer.

To complete the training sessions I will use a virtual app called Sufferfest , which as the name suggests is a festival of suffering. On a normal day one session is tough so completing 10 back to back will be challenging.

To help me get through the agony and anguish (and saddle sores) I would greatly appreciate any donation you can make towards the foodbank so they can continue their fantastic work in our community.

The food bank is available to all local residents, regardless of age. 

During the current Covid-19 pandemic, some food banks have closed and others are operating at reduced capacity. Many elderly and vulnerable residents are unable to rely upon their usual channels of support and many in the community have been affected financially due to the crisis and are unable to meet their basic daily needs. The Square Mile Food Bank is therefore a critical resource to ensure that those most in need can be provided with urgent, nutritious food supplies.

The food bank is volunteer led and relies solely on donations from members of the community, companies and other grant giving bodies. Any donation, large or small, will make a huge difference to ensure that we are able to reach as many people as need the service.

This is a project that helps the local community. Due to certain circumstances, our original plan was rejected by our leaders. Consequently we have created a new plan.

Our new project consists of two parts. 

Part one: we will be volunteering at Colchester Foodbank on Wednesday 21st August. Here we will do a litter pick around moorside business park and we will be sorting out food products stores at the warehouse.

Part two: we will be going into Highwoods Community Centre where we will be working in Squirrels Pre School to freshen it up and make it more appealing to the eye both inside and out. This will include: painting the sheds, clearing between the sheds, clearing weeds, a general tidy up and if we raise enough we will replace the old bamboo fencing. 

We are hopping to raise around £500. This money will be split equally between Squirrels Pre School and Colchester Foodbank after taking away any expenditures including paint and ingredients for the fundraisers. In order to raise this money we will be doing a sponsored walk and swim from shrub end community & sport centre to lesiure world and back with an hour swim this Friday 16th August. We will also be doing a bake sale in culver square on Tuesday 20th August from 10am-4pm.

We hope we can reach our target with your support.

Help us get to £500.

We hope to see you at our fundraisers!!

We are understandably gutted. Not only is Canned Laughter incredibly fun but all proceeds from ticket sales go directly to the local food bank in the area the gig is put on in and right now food banks need our support more than ever: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-51837892

All ticket holders will be offered refunds. But ideally we would still like to raise the money we would have made in ticket sales from these two gigs to help the two food banks they would have supported.

We have set our target amount roughly at 80% of all available tickets sold to both events which would have been £2,560. We will split any money raised from this drive between Eat or Heat, The Waltham Forest Food Bank (Canned Laughter - April 25th) and Euston Food Bank (Canned Laughter: Karaoke Roulette - April 4th)

I'm Jen, a comic book creator based in Leeds!


Over the last 2 years, I've done a couple of twitch streams to raise money for my local Trussell Trust foodbank - You can get more information about their important work and see my two previous campaigns here:

10 Hour Stream for the Foodbank - 2018
10 Hour Stream for my local Foodbank 2017

Sadly, as the pressure on the foodbanks continue to mount here in the UK, I am once again back to do silly things on the internet for 10 hours to raise money for charity - 

Only THIS year, there's a bit of a twist!
We have a new family member! Meet Petie:


Petie was taken in by the amazing people over at Dogs Trust Leeds after he had been repeatedly attacked in his previous home. He is a senior dog who just needed a stable and safe retirement home, and we were more than happy to help!

Going through the process of adopting Petie really opened my eyes to the exceptional work that goes on behind the scenes at Dogs Trust. I decided pretty quickly that I wanted to give back to them somehow in the near future.

So this 10 hour art stream will be a bit different than my previous two!

I will need to take a break to go for a walk with Petie, so the stream will briefly go offline for that, but I'll make up for that time by streaming a bit later! Whatever money is raised will be split evenly and donated to Trussell Trust foodbank Leeds and Dogs Trust! 

If you have a few pounds spare, please consider helping us out! 
And join our art stream on the 24th of October from 8am (UK Time) at https://www.twitch.tv/jeninator !

S2 Foodbank does essential work supporting families in the S2 postcode; a large area with many families on low incomes many of whom were struggling to make ends meet even before the Coronavirus. 

Learn more about S2 Foodbank here

This became even more poignant this weekend when Pat Midgley, mother of my good friend Neil, S2 Councillor and former mayor of Sheffield, passed away due to Coronavirus. As an S2 native she was a staunch supporter and helper at S2 Foodbank, demonstrating the outstanding social conscience that runs through the family. 

All I ask is that you think of about how much would you have spent on a few drinks had you been out this payday weekend? You might even have bought me a birthday drink? Instead, please donate what you can to help.

The Marie Emmanuel Foundation based in London and Abidjan is setting up a ""FoodBank"". A food bank that will be formed through a chain of solidarity that you and we will be part of, in order to provide food support to the poor families of Abidjan (people living day by day).

It is important that the strong one support the weak one because one will carry the other ...

Don't expect the government to do our part because it matters a lot. The survival of our Abidjan community depends on it.

A site has already been selected for the storage and distribution of food.

A kilo of rice, or a packet of spaghetti, or even a can of sardines, will be enough to give hope to a family. WITH ONLY £ 1 we can help at least one family in need.

It's the union that makes strength 

Let us know how to anticipate. As it is said so well, the provident never regretted (the prudent man sees evil from afar).

N.B: Volunteers living in Ivory Coast are also welcome to help set up this food bank."

Demand on resources has not been higher, so kindness, generosity and compassion for those around us in this time of need is more needed than ever before.

This has sparked an idea with the Digital Bees here at The Co-operative Bank - we must support individuals losing their jobs, vulnerable people unable to feed their families and anyone who is feeling the pain of the coronavirus pandemic which has hit the world. Food Banks feel huge pressures at Christmas, so you can't begin to imagine what they are dealing with to feed our nation. 

As an ethical bank, this is something we feel very strongly about and we to offer whatever aid we can to the Greater Manchester community.

To support the physical donation campaign we are running, we are also taking online donations via this page. 

“Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly and most underrated agent of human change” – we all have a part to play in making these dark times more bearable for one another so please give what you can to this amazing heart-felt cause.

Can you donate just five pounds to help this crisis? My name is Andy and having lived on the streets, I know what it's like to be hungry and to struggle. I can in some small way understand the fear and worry people would face without this resource. As someone often in the church building, I see first-hand people (often not the ones we 'picture' in our minds), but everyday hard-working families, people like us, who just need a helping hand. SO I went to Tesco to buy some food for us hoping to donate some too. But there was no food to give so I thought I could give my donation in financial terms - thus allowing Yeovil Christian Support Trust to top up their own surplus and use my gift as they require. Perhaps you would consider doing the same. Could you spare a fiver to help top up the food bank and other groups the Lords larder helps. The church link is https://yeovilcommunitychurch.co.uk and the charity is www.ycstyeovil.org.uk and ALL donations will go directly to them... helping provide food parcels and support all manner of clients in OUR town. 
Because who knows in this day and age, when we may need it ourselves. Thank You. I've set the target but would love to see that broken - plus I'm happy to accept silly challenges for money!! Or to rope others in to help with this!!

We purchased a Van to allow us to deliver the parcels and also to go to various supermarkets and collection points to collect the food. We have been able to support thousands of local people as a result and this has offshooted into other projects such as healthy eating courses, money management, cooking on a budget etc and signposting the people we support.

As we have grown, more and more volunteers have joined the team and we have a wide range of referral agencies including local schools, the police, womens refuges, mental health teams, social workers, homeless centres, crisis support teams and so on.

We are Energy, Mind and Body, a community support network of individuals passionate about the mental health and wellbeing of the local community and afar.

In light of COVID-19, we are finding many families are: 
• In isolation, unable to access basic necessities
• Are vulnerable, with pre-existing conditions
• Left unemployed and unable to put food on the table

EMB is dedicating itself to ensuring no one in our community is left behind. 

We have started collecting food donations and delivering food parcels to the most vulnerable through our network of amazing volunteers. We have been taken back by the number of people requiring help. 

We've partnered up with Tesco, Marks & Spencers & The Corner Cake Shop who are providing any excess stock they can give away. We have a wonderful community that has been generously purchasing a little extra with their weekly shop and kindly donating it to the cause, but unfortunately, we are still lacking some vital resources.

We want to raise £1,000 to be able to purchase food directly ourselves and provider our team of volunteers with the correct PPC gear while they are out making donations. 

No one is sure how long this lockdown will last, and it will get worse before it's better. We will be running this service to at least the next three months. If the crisis lasts longer, we will continue until we see fit. 

EMB is a not-for-profit organisation - every penny goes directly back into providing resources. If you can't financially donate, please considering dropping off any fresh or long-life food to our HQ on Molesworth Road. 

If you'd like to volunteer and help out within the community, please join our Facebook group - Mid Ulster Corona Virus Community Support Network

Now more than ever, we must look out for each other and protect those in the community that require help. Please consider donating your time, money or talent to this cause.

Our local community is fantastic in providing food donations, however the food bank still requires financial support for running costs to keep its doors open.

Here's where I need your help! I am going to try and raise £500 for the food bank by completing a 30-mile bike ride (indoors to ensure compliance with lockdown rules) on Saturday 16th May.

With more than 50 households now on our delivery list, we are in constant need of food donations. Many kind people, organisations and businesses have supported us, but to make sure we are able to continue delivering to an ever-increasing amount of households in our area, we are now seeking more support to be able to buy in food and items we desperately need but not always get through donations. We know the need won't end when the outbreak and lockdown is over, and any funding will help us bridge to a way back to our drop-in sessions. We expect that even when the Food bank can open its doors again, and people can come out to socialise and get advice and support in person, the world will still look different, so we want to be prepared for this transition period.

My friend Emma and myself are challenging ourselves this year and have decided to do our very first mountain climb. Scaling England's highest mountain, Scafell Pike. 

I know people who have to scratch about for money every month to be able to pay for bills and other essentials but, are still left wondering how to feed themselves and their children and it's just getting worse.... No one should have to do this but luckily there are food banks that can help out. I would like to raise some money so I can donate it to our local food bank ""The Cromer & District Foodbank"" to help them buy a few supplies. I don't know how much that will be but I hope anything is a help to them and the people that use the food banks.

Statistics taken from The Trussel Trust:

Between 1st April 2017 and 31st March 2018, The Trussell Trust’s foodbank network distributed 1,332,952 three day emergency food supplies to people in crisis, a 13% increase on the previous year. 484,026 of these went to children.

So if you are one of the lucky ones who can afford to spare a small amount, please think about sharing it with those who can't. Really, I would appreciate any donation. Plus, I need to get my bum up that mountain so please give me a little boost to get up there! 

The climb will take place on June 15th 2019 (weather depending).

Thank you

Love, Zoe x

PS: I hope to be the first person to twist a balloon dog at the top :D

This year for my birthday my loving parents decided to enter me into two marathons in one week! One in Edinburgh on the 26th of May and one in Cork on the 2nd of June. I can only presume they did this because they hate my guts (and my legs!!!). Seeing as I have no choice in the matter I thought I may raise some money while I am at it for a very worthy cause. 

In the UK nearly 1 in 5 children under the age of 15 live in a household that is moderately or severely food insecure, according to the British Medical Journal.

Storehouse NE Fife is one of many voluntary groups that needs our help to alleviate this issue. This is a very worthwhile cause, where every penny goes to helping those in need. 

So please donate whatever you can! It will be greatly appreciated!

And if you don't see me frantically running around St Andrews, trying to get in shape as quickly as possible, you can find me behind the bar in the Whey Pat you can give me a friendly word of encouragement!

Times are very hard during the current climate with the dreaded covid looming over, and the foodbank is as empty as it has been in a very long time. Shelves are bare and not enough donations being dropped off due to people isolating and keeping social distance rules.

Let's make this possible and donate what you can, you just never know when you may need to get help from the food bank, or know someone close that needs a helping hand.

On top of this, foodbanks currently do not receive any special treatment from supermarkets, limiting them to the two items per customer rule.

As a well established Foodbank of 12 years, volunteers continue this amazing community work in the difficult times.

Stocks need replenished continually and foodbank shopping trips for fresh food and items they're short of, amount to 100's of pounds. Not only is less food being donated to the foodbank, more people are in need of it. 

If donating items works best for you please see a list below of things that are needed and where these can be left. If, like me, you're isolating at home, and feel you have money you can donate, then this will be gratefully received. I will post updates here and on the Galashiels Foodbank Facebook page (link below).

From Facebook...
""During this difficult time in history it's wonderful that so many kind people have given donations of food and significant amounts of cash.
Having cash reserves allows us to buy in fresh food.
We really need ongoing donations of food items e.g. dried rice, pasta, cooking sauces for rice and pasta, tins of cold meat as well as meat for heating e.g. meatballs, tinned vegetables, instant potato e.g. smash, tins of custard, rice pudding. Also packets of breakfast cereal, sugar, tea, jars of instant coffee.
Food donations are gratefully received in the front porch of St Peters in Gala and Holy Trinity in Melrose as well as the collection points in Asda and Marks and Spencers, and COOP in Melrose.
Many thanks for your fantastic support.

We appreciate the uncertainly many are facing, but if you’re in a position to donate even just £5 (the equivalent of door entry into Hectors), this will massively help the effort. Every little really does help.

Every Sunday across the next 3 months (or however long the COVID-19 period continues for), we will use the funds raised that week to purchase and then drop off urgently needed food items. Whilst doing so, we’ll follow all guidance on social distancing and take hygiene precautions.

We'll keep you updated each week as to how much has been raised and the positive impact it's going to have for our local community.

This played big on my heart and mind and I want to do something especially on the lead up to Christmas. So my thought was to create a food parcel for my local Foodbank. When researching where the Foodbank was I came to realise that there is actually three of them in my small town. So I thought how can I give food parcels to all three locations? So I thought I would reach out to the fellow public. No Matter if I get help or not I will. Still commit to making one food parcel myself and donate it to the bank closest to myself.

A few days ago, someone came into the food bank desperately asking for food, but the staff could only give him half a bag of spaghetti to be given to the next person coming in.

The shelves are usually supposed to be filled with cans of food, but they are all empty. And the number of people coming in is increasing day by day.

Unfortunately i am not able to give much to them myself, so i decided i would create a campaign to raise money for the adults and children who are in need.

The work that foodbanks do is very important but due to the logistical issues of storing perishable produce the food is canned or dried.

Our aim is to offer fresh produce to those in need via our home delivery subscription service.

We plan to distribute voucher books to different food banks who can then issue a voucher to everyone who uses there foodbank. The voucher then can be redeemed via our website or over the phone.

Everyone deserves to eat fresh and healthy food. For every £26 raised one family will get a months supply of fresh greens delivered.

It is important, in this moment, that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has launched to support our community and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.

The Lambeth Food Bank Fund 

Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable, but there are many among us that will need more support, from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.

In Lambeth we have a history of looking after one another - and that spirit has never been more important than right now. 

So we are creating something called the Lambeth Food Bank Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after. 

Our borough has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has been set up for us to help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time. 

Please, even during these unprecedented circumstances, we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Lambeth. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.

FAQs

What can I do?

Right now because of the severity of the situation, the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money, so that we are able to help the most vulnerable. 

Where will the funds go?

The funds will go to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by Holy Trinity Clapham and delivered to food banks across the borough - including Brixton & Norwood, Clapham Park, Vauxhall, and Waterloo - that can help the most vulnerable. 

If I do donate will it go to those who need it? 

Yes, your donation will go to those who need it. Unlike other platforms, GoFundMe do not charge a fundraising fee although they take a small transaction fee. See here for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to.

Yes.

We have since been fortunate to receive some generous funding . The funding has enabled us to reach out to local schools, churches, council groups and other community organisations to identify families who would massively benefit from a food hamper during these difficult times. To date we have provided over 1500 food hampers to family’s within Northampton, and the demand for this support is increasing daily.

Grocery shopping has become a whole new experience entirely and I don't think any of us ever anticipated having to queue up outside the supermarket for ages- only to get inside and find many essential items not available. Fortunately for most of us this is only a temporary situation. 

Sadly many families have been financially hit hard by the lockdown. In particular the Refugee and Asylum Seeker community have not been able to work in lockdown and are not eligible for benefits and furlough pay. They have had to rely on Food Banks because they can't afford to shop at the supermarket; and the demand for these services is growing rapidly. 

Barnet Refugee Services set up a Food Bank in North London (Edgware) at the beginning of lockdown to ensure Asylum Seekers and Refugee families don't go hungry. In their first week of opening they provided food packages to 120 households, and now there are over 200 families depending on this service.

As COVID-19 seems to take us by surprise day by day we feel like now is the right time to act as a community to help those most in need.

How will your donation help?

This particular service will help us supply food and essentials to the vulnerable and those most in need in Barton. We will personally be out buying and delivering the essentials to do our bit to help the community.

All food and other donations can be dropped off to the given address on our Facebook Page, which also includes more information if you are in need of our help.

We would like to stress that this is a totally non-profitable origination and that any left over funds will be going direct to the NHS.

But stocks are running low, and the foundation urgently needs basic food items such as cereal, pasta, pasta sauce, soup, beans, tinned vegetables, fruit, biscuits, rice, eggs, sugar, tea bags, coffee and milk to continue offering support.

Elias Mattu Foundation had been helped by Lakshmi Sweet Centre Restaurant in Blakenhall, for hot meal on a daily base but needed others to come forward.

Some of the people we are helping are on benefits, and are elderly and vulnerable. A lot of them can't get out of the house because they are self-isolating and have no one else to do the shopping for them.

We are desperate to keep on supporting them but we need food donations.

For more information visit the Elias Mattu Foundation's Facebook page, or call Asha Mattu on 07904 310530.

Food items can be dropped off at a number of 6 Milford Road, Blakenhall, Wolverhampton, WV2 4NG."

The island is an island of tourism, many of the inhabitants come from the other islands in Cape Verde to work and rely on the wealth of the world for their survival. The island is poor at the best of times, relying solely on tourism. The wages are low but the cost of living is the same as the UK, if not more. Some essential items like Paracetamol can cost an average of £5 per packet, completely unaffordable by the locals. Like the rest of the world, the island is now in quarantine, but this means the islanders are not allowed to leave to travel back to their native islands and live with their families. Without tourism, the locals are without wages and money or financial aids to support themselves - yet are expected to live and survive on next-to-nothing. There have been a few charities set up and have already started to hand out some food to the families, but it's not enough. With majority of supplies coming from overseas and high demand, the local shops have doubled their prices, so food is considerably more expensive and unafforadable for most. My daughter, Chiara often says to me ""Mum, you can't save everybody"" and of course I know she's right. Whilst I know money is tight in the UK and around the world, I just cannot ignore how these locals, who depend on the rest of the world must feel. I feel compelled to try to help them, hence this ""gofundme"" page. The monies will go directly to the locals to buy basic food, of rice, vegetables, water and supplies and distributed to the families in need. I hope you will consider their plight and help, any small donation will help and be a significant difference to those who need it the most. There will be difficult months ahead until tourism replenishes the island again, but they are the most fantastic and beautiful hosts. The islanders of Boa Vista will welcome you and any guests with open arms, today and always - so much you will never want to leave their beautiful island. Lastly, I thank you for taking the time to read this on behalf of the locals whom depend on tourism for survival. Myself, like everyone else really hope we can all return to what was once normal life soon, but in the meantime let’s do our best to look after those who treat us with nothing but love and kindness. Much Love Bruna. This is a request for help, on behalf of Igor Tequila and the Islanders on Boa Vista https://www.gofundme.com/f/boa-vista-food-bank"

Many people have already lost their jobs, or they are in a state of uncertainty while awaiting news, and self-employed workers are finding themselves in a similar position - many are asking for a referral to a food bank for the very first time.

We are getting reports from the ground that food donations are gradually slowing down, and so at Essex Coronavirus Action we are raising funds to provide immediate payments to a number of food banks around Essex for the purchase of food and supplies. We are also in discussions with a number of retailers to make sure that food banks can purchase the items that they are running short of, while still managing to respect the new guidelines about reserved shopping hours for those who need them.

Every donation will be held in a bank account in the name of the Essex Association Of Local Councils, in trust on behalf of Essex County Council, ready for direct distribution to local food banks across the county.

We are an Ecuadorian family who wants to kick-start a fundraiser for the Latin American community in London, who have been directly or indirectly impacted by the coronavirus and find themselves and their families in crisis economically being pushed below the poverty line. 



What we would like to do?
We would like to raise funds so we can buy and collect food supplies and toiletries and give them to those who are in need in the Latin American community.
We need the funds urgently and continuously for the next three months at least whilst the covid-19 crisis stabilises. 


Why is this important?
As the lockdown in London began in a matter of days, we fear many Latin American people in London, equally as the rest of Londoners, are suffering greatly, many may have either lost their jobs as many work in hospitality and catering or may be waiting on what's next for them once lockdown eases. Many may be now below the poverty line suddenly. 


What do we need?
Cash donations allow us to buy food at low prices directly via our chain of suppliers
or
Food and toiletries donations
or
vehicles (cars, bikes, vans) to collect and deliver food and toiletries parcels


Support us!
We Latinos are supportive and charitable, welcoming to those in need, so let's get together turning an uncertain situation into an opportunity to help each other.
We hope that other Latin American organisations and institutions, leaders, such as Cllr Maria Linforth-Hall Southwark & Directora de “Su Mano Amiga”, Cllr Belgica Guaña, businesses and the normal Latin person in the street join us. Let the 'invisibles' be seen and help. We can make a true difference at this time and let's not forget we all need a hand sometimes.

We are very grateful for all your help! 
¿Quiénes somos?
Somos una familia ecuatoriana que busca poner en marcha una campaña de recaudación de fondos para la comunidad latinoamericana en Londres, afectada directa o indirectamente por la crisis relacionada al Covid-19. Existen miles de familias que hoy atraviesan un momento crítico económicamente y cuyas finanzas han sido empujadas por debajo del umbral de pobreza.

¿Qué nos gustaría hacer?
Estamos trabajando en la recaudación de fondos para poder adquirir y recoger suministros útiles para el diario vivir, como alimentos y artículos de aseo, para su entregárselos a las personas más necesitadas en la comunidad latinoamericana.
Para hacerlo, buscamos fondos de forma urgente con miras a continuar con la campaña los próximos tres meses, que serán críticos, y al menos hasta que la crisis se estabilice.

¿Por qué es importante?
Debido a que las restricciones en Londres iniciaron repentinamente, tememos que muchos latinoamericanos en la ciudad, igual que el resto de londinenses, están sufriendo mucho. La posibilidad de que miles hayan perdido sus trabajos debido a la naturaleza de sus empleos (muchos trabajan en el sector hotelero y gastronómico) y la incertidumbre sobre el futuro de ese sector laboral en los próximos meses acentúa este momento crítico y, de repente, los enfrenta a niveles preocupantes de pobreza.

¿Qué necesitamos?
Las donaciones en efectivo nos permiten comprar alimentos a precios bajos y más convenientes, directamente, a través de nuestra cadena de proveedores
O
Donaciones de alimentos y artículos de aseo
O
Transporte (coches, bicicletas, furgonetas) para recoger y entregar paquetes de alimentos y artículos de aseo

¡Apóyanos!
Los latinos nos caracterizamos por nuestra solidaridad, somos caritativos, empáticos y siempre damos una mano a quienes más los necesitan. Esta es una nueva oportunidad para reunirnos y convertir una situación incierta en una oportunidad para ayudarnos unos a otros.

Esperamos que otras organización es e instituciones latinoamericanas y líderes, como la Cllr María Linforth-Hall Southwark y Directora de “Su Mano Amiga”, Cllr Bélgica Guaña Newham, empresas y la persona latina normal en la calle se unan a nosotros. Que quienes hoy son ""invisibles"" sean vistos y nos ayuden a ayudar. Podemos hacer una verdadera diferencia en este momento al no olvidar que todos necesitamos una mano a veces.

¡Estamos muy agradecidos por toda su ayuda!

The Challenge
Covid -19 is an unprecedented challenge for us all. SBT feel our immediate priority is ensuring our food banks have adequate food to help the most vulnerable in the city. They are struggling with donations due to panic buying whilst facing increased demand. 

What can I do?
We have partnered with the Sheffield food bank network http://www.sheffieldfoodbank.org.uk/food-bank-list/. There are 15 food banks in the network who helped over 40,000 people last year. We would like those of you who are not experiencing financial hardship, to consider donating a weeks bus fare, petrol, parking charges, or whatever you can afford. Given most businesses have implemented some form of home working, many may not have incurred these costs.

Donations will be shared across the 15 food banks in the Sheffield network. 

Thanks in advance for your contribution, together we can make a massive difference.

Hi everyone,

I hope this message finds you all safe and well.

I am currently at home on my own most days losing my mind in self isolation. As I sit here watching so many brave people in all sorts of walks of life putting themselves and their families at risk without a second thought, I have decided to do my bit and to raise funds for our local food banks here in all our local areas. These will include Middlesbrough, Thornaby, Stockton - On - Tees and Billingham.

I will contact each local food bank and ask if they would like me to take them stock directly or if they would prefer the cash so that they can prioritise exactly what they need.

All I am looking for is any spare change type donations which will go a long, long way to helping those in our local community in the greatest need of all.

If you are unable to donate anything just sharing this post will help raise funds for those who have fallen through the benefits system, or do not qualify for any of the government help.

I am kicking off the fund with a donation of £100.00

Thank you for your time.

Sergio."

After a succesful shop for The Axminster Food Bank Christmas 2018 and another for The Salvation Army Christmas 2019, we were hoping to do one at the beginning of the year, however in the light of Covid-19 we feel like this is a critical time to pull together to try and support our local communities and those most vulnerable. 

Fundraising

How can I help?

Did you know that 3,000 Nigerians die daily of hunger? Or that in borno state 64.2% of households are food insecure? 

A lot of people aren’t aware that approximately 61% of the population in Nigeria are living in poverty. We want to change that. Growing up in Nigeria and seeing poverty around us daily has made us understand how fortunate we are to have 3 meals a day. This is why we have decided to start a mobile food bank to help those who aren’t as fortunate. We hope to feed a minimum of 700 people in Nigeria this summer and continue this food bank during other holidays. 
 All the donations we receive will be going towards food supply and transportation.

Please donate what you can towards this food bank donation fund in order to aid individuals & families struggling to feed themselves as a result of covid-19.

No amount is too little to make a difference.

As a result of covid-19:

-Breadwinners have lost employment and their income.

-Low income families who previously relied on free school meals to feed their children will have to provide lunches, potentially for months, having had no time to plan or save for this extra expense. Parents will go hungry to feed their children.

-Elderly and vulnerable people are short on supplies due to a lack of availability in stores.

Please donate what you can towards this food bank donation fund.

You can do so via this fundraising page or in-store at Bradbury's butchers and deli Ravenshead Nottingham NG15 9BD

Any money raised will be used to purchase long-life food items at wholesale price for donation to local food banks.

We are Forty Clothing from Glasgow, and we’re trying to do our bit during these harrowing times.


Every Saturday since the lockdown began, our Managing Director and DJ extraordinaire Harry has been entertaining our customers and followers alike from the comfort of his own home. For one hour a week he plays his favourite tunes in the hope of brightening people’s weekends while we’re all stuck in the house. We’ve also been trying to promote health and safety and social distancing through our social channels to all of our amazing followers and offering free gifts with orders placed on our website, as well as starting our weekly Big Forty Quarantine Quiz as our way of helping and putting smiles on the faces of others at this time.


But we realise that more has to be done. At this time, people and businesses are struggling. People have lost their jobs and their income, others have no childcare and support. Many people are struggling with both their physical and mental health. Key workers are risking their lives every day, often in low-paid jobs. Charities are losing out on the vital donations they need to maintain the incredible work they do. 


We’d love to help these people in some way, and for this reason we are raising money for a food bank drive. Food banks are there to help those who are struggling no matter the cause, and provide them with the basic necessities they need to survive. While times are tough for us all, food bank volunteers are continuing to do their bit for society, and although we all wish there was no need for food banks in our society the sad truth is that many people rely on them to get by - and at this time they may be more stretched than usual.


Every week we will support a different food bank. Using the money raised, Harry will buy and donate the items requested by the food banks on behalf of all the Forty Family. We understand that times are tough right now for many of us, but if you do have anything to spare we would massively appreciate your help. We’ll also keep you all up to date with the process so you know that your donation has helped and made a difference to the lives of people here in Scotland.

The first food bank to benefit will be Newarthill Food Bank - from Harry’s hometown.


In the meantime, stay home, stay safe, stick together and stay apart!

Thank you and we’ll see you soon, 

Forty Clothing ❤️"

"Support Lewisham Local Food Bank born from Barbers","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-lewisham-local-food-bank-born-from-barbers,385,2000,2020-05-15T14:08:53.0000000-05:00,04/22/2020,,,14,"Ziggy, the owner of Progress Barbers in Catford, Lewisham has done something well out of the ordinary...



Due to the pandemic, countless numbers of small and local businesses have been forced to close - with barbershops/hair salons being examples of the businesses that are suffering the most. Now, the normal response for the owner of a business like this would be to take advantage of rate relief, seek bridge funding for the business and also look for financial support being offered to people that are self-employed.

But not Ziggy...



Ziggy has converted the Barbershop into a Food Bank that is specifically focused on helping the elderly and other vulnerable members of the local community to have access to the food and sustenance they need in a time when it may be challenging to make trips to supermarkets or go shopping themselves.

We all know that local businesses like barbershops are massive pillars within communities as they are connected to so many people and aware of a range of local issues. So, who better and where better for a Food Bank to support vulnerable people to come from?



As it stands, Ziggy is not only travelling (on his own dime) to his shop, to the homes of people who cannot make it to his Food Bank and even spending his own money to buy food if he is short on donations from local people that are aware his Food Bank Exists. ALL WHILST HE IS LOSING MONEY AS HE CANNOT TRADE AND RUN HIS BUSINESS AS NORMAL.

So, now we need to support this local hero by helping to alleviate the financial pressure that comes from still having to maintain the utility costs at the shop, the transport costs that come with running the Food Bank and also to help access further food to support vulnerable local people."

At this difficult time we have heard that lots of children and families are struggling to afford food and the basic things we take for granted.

So we decided to set ourselves a challenge for the next 30 days.

Amy will hula hoop for 20 minutes every day and each day she will add something new to the challenge, such as reading whilst hula hooping!

At difficult times like we are currently in, the best thing we can do is help one another and make sure everyone has enough.

As we know food banks are suffering massively and barely have anything on their shelf’s, which means families and individuals are also struggling to feed their families.

I know what that feels like, so I hope we can all pull together and donate as little as a pound towards the cause. All donations will go to supplying the local food banks with whatever they need! I do not mind showing proof of this! 

it will also be used to make a care package for the elderly. I will
locate those in need and help they as much asI possibly can.

It is the elderly community who are set to be effected the most so we will be making up some “basics bags” and asking people to let us know if they are aware of anyone (a neighbour, friend, relative...) in need of supplies so we can deliver some bits and help them through this together :)
This is a time to be aware of people who are alone. It is possible they could face isolation for months at a time... let’s show that we genuinely care.
please donate... even if it’s a pound or two! That could be enough to brighten someone’s week.
