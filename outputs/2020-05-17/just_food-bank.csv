,,,1110522,"The Trussell Trust",False,2019-11-28,"<div></div><div dir=""auto"">This festive season we’re building on the successes of the previous two years and raising money for the Trussell Trust — a brilliant charity that helps thousands of people in the UK feed their families in times of crisis via foodbanks. Last year, the Trussell Trust network gave out over 1.6 million three-day emergency food supplies to people in need, that’s a 19% increase on the previous financial year.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">When we started raising money for the Trussell Trust in 2017, 13 million people were living below the poverty line. Two years on, this number has grown to 14 million. People are going hungry every day for a range of reasons, from benefit delays (due to a drastically underfunded switch to universal basic income) to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. This number is growing for a multitude of reasons but the responsibility lies in the same place each time. Our current government is failing us.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">Winter is always the busiest period for foodbanks, so we’d like your help to raise as much cash as possible. A tin of beans costs as little as 30p, so any donation you make however small or large will really help!</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">We wish that each year we wouldn't need to fundraise for this cause, it shouldn’t be down to the Trussell Trust (and many other similar organisations), there should be a system that supports and cares for people.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">Please share this on all of your social platforms to help us achieve our goal. Then, on December the 12th please vote for a change — the right are failing us all, but most importantly, they're failing those who are in need of a social care system that works.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">Thank you, we couldn’t do this without you!</div><div><br></div><div><div><div><div><font color=""#3a3a3a""></font></div></div></div></div>",73,73,"2020-01-11 10/2019-12-24 15/2019-12-19 7/2019-12-19 10/2019-12-17 30/2019-12-16 10/2019-12-14 25/2019-12-14 20/2019-12-14 20/2019-12-14 20/2019-12-14 10/2019-12-13 20/2019-12-13 20/2019-12-12 10/2019-12-12 50/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 10/2019-12-10 10/2019-12-10 50/2019-12-10 10/2019-12-10 20/2019-12-10 20/2019-12-10 30/2019-12-09 20/2019-12-09 20/2019-12-07 20/2019-12-07 10/2019-12-06 25/2019-12-05 10/2019-12-05 5/2019-12-05 20/2019-12-03 20/2019-12-03 20/2019-12-03 5/2019-12-03 20/2019-12-02 25/2019-12-02 10/2019-12-01 20/2019-12-01 10/2019-11-30 15/2019-11-29 25/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 40/2019-11-29 100/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 50/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 15/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-28 15/2019-11-28 30/2019-11-28 10/2019-11-28 10/2019-11-28 50",https://www.justgiving.com/Foodbank2019,2020-01-11,1507,1500,"Festive Food Bank Fundraiser 2019"

This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.</p><p>Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure. We're working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.</p>",0,0,,https://www.justgiving.com/AnneThomasPhotographyVirtualShoot,,0,300,"Anne's Virtual Photoshoot"

Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year. Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, it is likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.&nbsp;</p><p><span>As part of our weekly food shop in St Albans, my wife and I always buy a couple of food items to put into the food bank. I have noticed that since the Coronavirus lockdown started, the amount of food donated has decreased massively, which is understandable given everybody's changing circumstances and concerns about their personal welfare. At the same time, demand for food banks is increasing, so I would like to do something to contribute to this worthy cause.</span></p><p><span>As I've been furloughed since April 1st, I have had time to do more cycling than I would otherwise.

So my plan is to ride 100 miles through the countryside of Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire taking in towns and villages such as Ivinghoe, Woburn and Baldock. As I use the Strava app, I intend to publish the ride details once done. Because my route will be estimated as 100 miles, if I complete it and find I am short, I will endeavour to make up the extra miles before I step back indoors!<br><br>The ride date is scheduled for May 20th with the proviso that if the weather is particularly bad I would move it to the next possible date.

I see people outside with boxes to collect customers donations. It makes me sad when I am so privalled to know there are people out there who can barley afford a meal for their family! After seing the posters I have decided to try and help and do something about this issue. I know this won't solve all hunger but it will defintley help! I am collecting donations and then using the money to buy lots of cans of food to donate to a local food bank. I will be donating all the food brought from the money raised to the Trussel Trust in Uckfield. I hope I can help some people out there who really need it:) Please donate whatever you can, it will really make a difference!

By participating in this collective endeavour, we hope that the seeds of Sewa are watered so that acts of kindness and public service are performed more often. Sewa Day is a catalyst in making this happen.",0,0,,https://www.justgiving.com/UmeshChampaneri,,0,950,"Sewa Day: Help a Neighbour Appeal"

This whole pandemic nonsense will hit those on low to no incomes the hardest and, right now, it’s tricky enough to find some of life’s essentials in the shops when you <i>can</i> afford them.</p><p>So as I sat here at home, unravelling at the prospect of being on lockdown, stuck inside, having to move house and have building work done in the midst of all of this, I realised I was being a bit of a whiny bitch. So, in a not entirely selfless effort to take back some control and maybe put a Kit-kat in a hungry mouth, I’ve decided to buzz off my hair for charity.</p><p>Specifically, The Trussell Trust, who support a nationwide network of food banks, including one in Cheltenham. Coronavirus has made food banks even more necessary for some people, so I thought they were a good recipient of the hair money. It’s like blood money but scratchier.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve never buzzed my hair off before, and I’m fairly sure I’ll look ridiculous, so there’s your incentive. I’ll live stream the removal of my distinguished locks and may well get my daughter to do the deed as she’ll no doubt find it hilarious and will be able to reach the back better.</p><p>Target’s £500. More would be amazing though, and super helpful for a really important charity. I dunno, maybe I’ll dream up some stretch goal rewards or something if we break the target. Time and date of The Buzzening to be announced as and when/if the mark is hit. If it isn’t hit, well, we’ll see. And I say buzz rather than shave because I’m not pulling a razor across my bonce.

This is a bit nuts. A lot nuts actually. See the picture of the blue football shirt? Well, it ain't just any football shirt. It is a Scotland shirt for the discerning, patriotic smaller Scottish dog. Believe it or not we have had forty of these donated and they are all in serious need of a good home.</p><p>Well in&nbsp;a few days time Scotland will be taking on the Auld Enemy at Wembley and your wee pooch must be desperate to wear the colours. So here's the good news. If you were to give any kind of donation to this page one of these canine shirts might just find its way to you in the post so long as you give me a bell on 077770 443483 to sort it out.</p><p>Yeah, I know. But these are times when frontline charities like First Base need to clutch at every straw we can find!</p><p><strong>ABOUT ME LIVING OFF ONE OF OUR FOOD PARCELS.</strong></p><p>I really don't want to make any kind of big deal out of what I'm doing here! I guess in a way I am about to put my money where my mouth is. In September I will live off one of the First Base Agency's emergency food parcels for half a week.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the picture above. I know. It isn't going to be so very hard, right?. And it shouldn't be so very hard. All of us at First Base are pretty proud of the emergency food parcels we have been handing out for the last 13 years. We are very much aware that the REALLY hard part of living off emergency food is being in a position where you NEED to live off emergency food. It is a very bleak place indeed to find yourself in. We see this every single day in the eyes of those who come into First Base.</p><p>I am lucky. I don't need emergency food. Not right now at least. So I am not asking for your support for any kind of recognition of me doing something remotely difficult. Instead I am asking for support for something much more profound. Over the coming eight months of winter over 3000 people will come through the doors of First Base. Each and every one of them will be in the miserable position of finding themselves unable to buy food to eat. And we will all do our very best to make sure each and every person who comes to us will leave the building with a bag full of the kind of food I am about to live off for a few days.</p><p>But there is a problem. A pretty big problem. As I write these words we have enough funding in place to just about keep the doors open until the end of December. Then nothing. January nothing. February nothing. March nothing. Three long, cold winter months when hundreds and hundreds of people will need us to be there to provide emergency food.</p><p>Sadly this is a problem we are only too familiar with. Every frontline charity in Britain knows how it is to live on the edge of a funding cliff. It is hard and it is stressful. Our local community is utterly amazing when it comes to donating food. Last year we received over £40,000's worth. When I spend my three days eating emergency food I will be lucky enough to have a fresh loaf of bread donated by Greggs and a pack of ham donated by Brown Brothers. The list of our food donors is a long one and we feel honoured to be supported by so many.</p><p>However the bags of food that arrive every day will never pay our electric bill. Or the phone bill. Or the rent. Or wages. Or the detailed accounts we are legally and rightly obliged to produce for the charity regulator. Or fuel in the tank to deliver made up food parcels to the 20 collection points we bow have across the region.</p><p>These are the boring bills which cover the nuts and bolts of keeping the doors of any front line charity open. They are boring but unavoidable. And the money to cover these boring bills is our life blood. By hook or by crook we need to find £20,000 before the end of March to ensure our doors stay open. It won't be easy. Anything but. However it is a situation we are only too familiar with. We have faced down this kind of funding crisis many times over the last 13 years and we are confident of doing so again. Never once have we turned away a single person who has come to us for emergency food. Not once. We're all pretty proud of that record and we have no intention of allowing such a thing to happen in the coming winter.</p><p>So. How can you help? Well there are two options. Of course you can donate a few quid on this page and if you do so we will be hugely appreciative. Or maybe you might want to go a stage further and do exactly what I am doing - live off a First Base emergency food parcel for half a week and raise so cash either with a page like this one or by using more traditional sponsorship forms. So how would that work? Easy. You can call me on either 07770 443483 or 01387 279680 or you can e mail me at markglenmill@aol.com. I will then deliver you a three day food parcel and sponsorship forms should you need any. Tell you what. I'll throw in a full signed set of my back list of books as a thank you. Then it is a case of eating emergency food for three days and chasing in a few donations.&nbsp;</p><p>So that's that I guess. Please support us either by donating to this page or by starting up a page of your own. Maybe I will see you soon with a box of food and a bag of books!</p><p>All the best</p><p>Mark</p>",127,2,"2020-03-31 20/2018-05-23 60",https://www.justgiving.com/MarkSimonFrankland,2020-03-31,12556,15000,"I'm raising cash to make sure the First Base food bank survives the winter"
,,,1140963,"FAST UK",False,2017-10-06,"<p>For the past three years FAST UK has helped to finance an emergency food bank for some of the poorest people and families living in the Rroma village called Apalina on the outskirts of Reghin. So far the charity has helped to feed over 200 families but we would love to help more!</p><p>After a past visit we were asked for some help by Pastor Attila Toth who informed us that many families within this village were trying to survive on just one or two small meals per week. In the summer months it is possible for families to survive on gleanings from locally grown crops but in winter with temperatures often dropping to as low as -32 degrees centigrade with snow on the floor this makes this way of living almost impossible.</p><p>With the money raised on this page as a charity we will send money to Attila so that he is able to purchase good basic food locally in Reghin. All of the food purchased will be given out to the most needy families according to the need.&nbsp;</p><p>On a recent visit this summer that I was on Attila told one of our trustees that the funds provided over the past few years have enabled people to have enough to eat through the harsh winters and in a few cases even prevent people from starving to death. After seeing the people living within the village in September 2017 and hearing many families stories, I feel very passionate about helping them and would love you to as well!</p><p>Currently the total we send to the food bank is £1500.00 per year but we would love to send more if possible so more people can be helped. The £1500.00 we give feeds approx 200 through the long winters which amounts to about £10 per person to see them through the whole winter period. This money not only enables people to eat but also to have a much easier time throughout the winter months as this is often the hardest time for families living in such a difficult environment and with so little.&nbsp;</p><p>Can you help some on eat well this winter for just £10?</p><p><font color=""#212121"">If you can help then that would be fantastic, remember&nbsp;no matter how much you can donate, every pound helps to feed a person for a day, week, month and winter.</font></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

,,,1156156,"Urban Community Projects",False,2020-04-15,"<p>Friends, <br><br>Thank you for taking the time to visit my fundraising page for <em>Urban Community Projects</em>, a charity which provides&nbsp;an array of&nbsp;activities - food deliveries, job training, mentoring, financial coaching&nbsp;- to members of our community who are most in need. I recently signed up to volunteer for one of Urban Community Projects' initiatives, the Camden Mobile Food Bank, to deliver food donations to vulnerable families who live on local estates. I signed up for the initiative because of 2 major reasons:<br><br>1) More so than ever, this is a time when&nbsp;the recipients&nbsp;really need our help as many of them, be it the elderly or ill,&nbsp;are confined to their homes and are unable to collect the food parcels themselves. &nbsp;<br><br>2) I myself have been fortunate enough to be a recipient of other people's generosity of time and financial resources, and I know from firsthand experience that a small act of kindness has the power to make a significant difference to another individual's life.&nbsp;To the extent that I&nbsp;am able to, I would like to keep this 'cycle of generosity' alive. <br><br>I am appealing to you because alongside my volunteering to deliver food, I&nbsp;have created a page&nbsp;to help raise funds for <em>Urban Community Projects </em>so that the charity is able to continue carrying out essential services to vulnerable members of our community, at a time when it is most needed. If you are able to, I ask that you please donate through the&nbsp;<em>Just Giving&nbsp; </em>website to&nbsp;support <em>Urban Community Projects</em>. <br><br>I will match your donations by committing to&nbsp;doing as many food delivery trips as I can possibly squeeze in outside of my work hours. &nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance.<br>Sello </p>",50,50,"2020-05-12 100/2020-05-07 30/2020-05-06 30/2020-05-04 50/2020-05-04 15/2020-05-04 50/2020-05-03 30/2020-05-01 100/2020-04-29 100/2020-04-25 50/2020-04-25 30/2020-04-21 20/2020-04-21 200/2020-04-21 30/2020-04-21 100/2020-04-21 100/2020-04-21 25/2020-04-20 20/2020-04-20 50/2020-04-19 30/2020-04-19 20/2020-04-17 50/2020-04-17 100/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 10/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 50/2020-04-16 20/2020-04-16 50/2020-04-15 40/2020-04-15 20/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-15 50/2020-04-15 50/2020-04-15 20/2020-04-15 20",https://www.justgiving.com/Sello-Lekalakala,2020-05-12,3290,5000,"A Helping Hand "

This is not your usual sponsored walk/cycle/run because several members of the team are self isolating - we're going to be getting creative and completing our miles in all sorts of ways, including exercise bikes, step machines!&nbsp;</p><p>We've chosen to support The Trussell Trust for this because we want to support the vital service that they offer. More and more people are being forced to use food banks because they cannot afford the basics in life. Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year. Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure. The Trussell Trust are working closely with their network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how each food bank can be best supported in the coming months to make sure that they're able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.</p><p>Anything you can give to help this worthy cause will make a difference.

The dogs were welcome in and I sat alone in the corner waiting for my husband to pick me up when I got talking to a stranger. One hour later it transpires that the guy was an ex- serviceman who due to PTS had found himself living locally in a tent, we got talking and although his life was tough he took nothing from the government but did odd jobs in order to provide for himself. I brought him a pint and later my son and husband turned up, he offered to buy us all a drink which I decided as we were driving, he still came back from the bar with three orange juices. We have so much and he has nothing but yet he still brought us a drink which he could not afford. We all have so much in life and yet others have nothing and yet they are willing to share what they have! My son learnt so much tonight, on the way home he asked if we could give all his old toys to other people for Christmas that didn't have things for Christmas! Tomorrow I am off to do a weeks shop and leave it with the landlord to give to that man as last night was a truly moving experience not just for me but for my entire family!

The fallout from poverty is enormous; mental health issues, access to health services, travel, employment, access to healthy food, happy and well cared for children.&nbsp;</p><p>Without foodbanks, many people in poverty would have NO access to food at all. They provide a safe space. Somewhere warm and dry. They can also offer support and advice to those in need, who may be isolated or unsure of their options. We have nurses in this country who have to use foodbanks, just to survive. I can't change the way this country is going (I wish I could), but if I can do something, even if it's only a small contribution, then I feel like I've helped in some way. Also, please donate food to local foodbanks whenever you can. You never know when you might have to rely on their services yourself.

I decided to set a challenge to some friends. There are several great efforts going on to raise money for the NHS charities, so I thought i’d go with something that is local to many of my friends and colleagues - this is the area right next to Dell Glasgow (remember that place!?)<br><br>Challenge is simple  (but not easy!) &amp; for the golfers out there, but anyone can try it! <br><br>Just like several similar challenges, the golfer needs to get 20 balls, place a bucket, basin or plant pot etc. 10 feet away. Film yourself hitting all 20 and for everyone you get in the bucket - donate (a minimum) of £2.00 to the just giving page below. <br><br>https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/carlo-cocozza<br><br>The idea is to get a lot of people taking part, so please post your video and nominate another garden golfer! <br><br>If you are tagged in this, you are nominated 😉 good luck!<br><br>Eg get 1 out of 20, donate £2 (or whatever you choose). <br>Get none in, donate at least £2 anyway.

However, having spent my 50th birthday in the pandemic lockdown, I wanted to turn the bike tour into a chance to raise money for the Trussell Trust, whose food banks so many people rely on and which sadly is in even greater demand now as the severe economic hardship for many during this crisis intensifies.</p><p>I will be setting off on Sunday 19th July.

,,,1110522,"The Trussell Trust",False,2020-03-24,"More and more people are being forced to use food banks because they cannot afford the basics in life. Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

I was fighting Pneumonia at the time, but I had no hiccups besides that. Once it came to being in active labour, I had a routine episiotomy due to some difficulty and my son was born at 3:43am January 31st 2020. However, things went downhill really quickly. Myself and Logan were put on IV antibiotics very quickly plus I had to have 2 blood transfusions (both failed) and I don’t really remember much from there. All I know is that the doctors told me they didn’t have much hope for me surviving and they were surprised I did. Logan and I were treated for sepsis for 7 days and we both came out of the situation okay thankfully. The mental effects of it were what made the suffering more horrendous and now, 15 weeks later, I want to be able to help others who have been through what I have.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>That’s why we are raising money for the U.K. sepsis trust and doing a charity bake sale.</span><br></p>",2,2,"2020-05-16 3/2020-05-16 5",https://www.justgiving.com/Tabi-Fenton,2020-05-16,8,300,"Tabi and Jack do a bake sale"

Food packs are tailored to local cuisines and diets, but they contain items such as rice, lentils, oil, sugar, flour, tomato paste and dates.

As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.</span><br></p>",169,169,"2020-05-13 20/2020-05-12 10/2020-05-11 26/2020-05-10 10/2020-05-10 85/2020-05-10 10/2020-05-10 10/2020-05-10 20/2020-05-10 20/2020-05-10 20/2020-05-09 20/2020-05-09 20/2020-05-09 10/2020-05-09 5/2020-05-09 20/2020-05-09 10/2020-05-09 10/2020-05-09 20/2020-05-09 60/2020-05-09 30/2020-05-08 20/2020-05-08 20/2020-05-08 30/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-08 100/2020-05-08 30/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-08 140/2020-05-08 30/2020-05-08 20/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-08 5/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-08 30/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-08 30/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-08 5/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-08 50/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-08 20/2020-05-08 20/2020-05-08 5/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-07 30/2020-05-07 10/2020-05-07 30/2020-05-07 30/2020-05-07 25/2020-05-07 20/2020-05-07 10/2020-05-07 20/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-06 20/2020-05-06 20/2020-05-06 20/2020-05-06 30/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-06 20/2020-05-06 15/2020-05-06 20/2020-05-05 20/2020-05-05 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 20/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 20/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 100/2020-05-04 10/2020-05-04 20/2020-05-04 20/2020-05-03 10/2020-05-03 20/2020-05-03 10/2020-05-03 10/2020-05-03 20/2020-05-03 10/2020-05-03 10/2020-05-03 20/2020-05-03 10/2020-05-03 10/2020-05-03 20/2020-05-03 20/2020-05-03 10/2020-05-03 20/2020-05-03 20/2020-05-03 10/2020-05-03 10/2020-05-03 20/2020-05-02 10/2020-05-02 5/2020-05-02 5/2020-05-02 20/2020-05-02 5/2020-05-02 10/2020-05-02 20/2020-05-02 20/2020-05-02 10/2020-05-02 10/2020-05-02 10/2020-05-02 20/2020-05-02 20/2020-05-02 10/2020-05-02 30/2020-05-02 30/2020-05-02 10/2020-05-02 30/2020-05-02 20/2020-05-02 10/2020-05-02 10/2020-05-02 20/2020-05-02 50/2020-05-02 20/2020-05-02 10/2020-05-02 10/2020-05-02 20/2020-05-02 10/2020-05-02 20/2020-05-02 10/2020-05-02 10",https://www.justgiving.com/rgarratt30milechallenge,2020-05-14,3040,200,"Richard's 30 Mile Challenge"

This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year. Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure. We're working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that they're able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.</p>",25,25,"2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-11 20/2020-05-10 10/2020-05-10 20/2020-05-10 10/2020-05-10 20/2020-05-07 10/2020-05-07 10/2020-05-07 10/2020-05-07 10/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-06 20/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-06 20/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-06 20/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-05 10",https://www.justgiving.com/Practice-O-Thon,2020-05-13,340,250,"Oscar's Practice-A-Thon"
