It is important, in this moment, that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has launched to support our community and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.

The Lambeth Food Bank Fund 

Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable, but there are many among us that will need more support, from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.

In Lambeth we have a history of looking after one another - and that spirit has never been more important than right now. 

So we are creating something called the Lambeth Food Bank Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after. 

Our borough has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has been set up for us to help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time. 

Please, even during these unprecedented circumstances, we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Lambeth. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.

FAQs

What can I do?

Right now because of the severity of the situation, the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money, so that we are able to help the most vulnerable. 

Where will the funds go?

The funds will go to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by Holy Trinity Clapham and delivered to food banks across the borough - including Brixton & Norwood, Clapham Park, Vauxhall, and Waterloo - that can help the most vulnerable. 

If I do donate will it go to those who need it? 

Yes, your donation will go to those who need it. Unlike other platforms, GoFundMe do not charge a fundraising fee although they take a small transaction fee. See here for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to. 

I want to help my local community, will this money be spent in Lambeth? 

Yes.

So in today's tough times so many people during the Covid 19 pandemic, are finding many great ways to raise funds, for those less fortunate.
Currently, there is a huge need to help support the food banks, as so many people are needing additional help, to put food on the table, which is where the idea came from.

Many people leading up to the bank holiday would be planning where they are going to stay overnight camping or in their vans or on holiday, sadly for the VE-Day weekend that can no longer happen. So why dont we celebrate at home ?

So the idea is simple plan your trip based at home, prepare everything you need to go camping, stay overnight on the drive in your van, a tent in your garden, or even in your house (but it must be set up like a camping trip), or in your caravan. 

So how do we raise funds ? 
Donate a minimum of £5 in the pot or the amount you would normally have paid for a night camping at your favourite spot during the bank holiday weekend.
If local to Nailsea, the money will go to food bank in Nailsea, if not to the national food bank network, every £ will make a difference.

Its not just about fundraising, so let's have some fun, go to town decorating your place of accommodation, take pictures, upload them to the Facebook page, use your imagination to have an amazing night or more 'away at home!'"

But the coronavirus epidemic will be a massive challenge for them, on a whole new scale. More and more people are going to need their help over the next few months.

People on zero hours contracts won't get paid.

Food will need to be delivered to the elderly and sick who are self-isolating.

If schools close, many children will lose their main meal and need to be fed.

And all this is happening at a time when the rest of us are going to the supermarket less and - let's be honest - thinking about our own food cupboards first.

So, here's a very simple way to help. You give money. Every time we get to £100 I ask the foodbank what they need most and go and get it. If things get really bad, I will organise a delivery. We all keep doing this over and over again until things get better.


Why aren't Fair Frome doing this? Well, they've got a heck of a lot on their plate right now and this is one way I can take the load off them. It's also easier for me to set up a fundraiser as an individual.

Who am I anyway? Good question, I have volunteered for the food bank before, and here I am with Lenka, their co-ordinator, in the food bank. Fair Frome know that I am making this appeal and are very happy to have the fundraising happen.


I will post the receipt on here every time I go shopping.

But if you're still worried, please do take some food to the Fair Frome collection points in Sainsburys, Asda, Frome Wholefoods and Barnardos instead. 


Frome is a great community. Let's channel this and do our best to see all our town through the next few months.

More information about Morecambe Bay Foodbank: Helping people in the Morecambe and Lancaster area who cannot get food due to an emergency situation

ABOUT
“The foodbank was there when we really needed it, it was an absolute lifeline.”

We don’t think anyone in our community should have to face going hungry. That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks, supported by The Trussell Trust, working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.

ABOUT OUR FOODBANK
An introduction to the Morecambe Bay Foodbank project.
Morecambe Bay Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups, working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. It began life at the GYM Church on Green Street in Morecambe and has now moved to The West End Community Centre on Westminster Road in Morecambe. We receive and distribute over six tonnes of food each month and our operation has been growing since its inception in 2012. 

We have a small staff team led by our Foodbank Manager, Annette Smith, and over eighty regular volunteers who give up their time to help us each week.

ABOUT
HOW FOODBANKS WORK
Providing emergency food to people in crisis.
Every day people in the UK go hungry for reasons ranging from redundancy to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. A simple box of food makes a big difference, with foodbanks helping prevent crime, housing loss, family breakdown and mental health problems.

FOOD IS DONATED
Schools, churches, businesses and individuals donate non-perishable, in-date food to a foodbank. Large collections often take place as part of Harvest Festival celebrations and food is also collected at supermarkets.

FOOD IS SORTED AND STORED
Volunteers sort food to check that it’s in date and pack it into boxes ready to be given to people in need. Over 40,000 people give up their time to volunteer at foodbanks.

PROFESSIONALS IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN NEED
Foodbanks partner with a wide range of care professionals such as doctors, health visitors, social workers and police to identify people in crisis and issue them with a foodbank voucher.

CLIENTS RECEIVE FOOD
Foodbank clients bring their voucher to a foodbank centre where it can be redeemed for three days’ emergency food. Volunteers meet clients over a warm drink or free hot meal and are able to signpost people to agencies able to solve the longer-term problem."

We reached out for food and money donations from our loyal friends and followers and started to deliver food hampers to those who needed it most. 

Our initial plan was to provide some food hampers over a 2-week period, or when the donations ran out. However, once we started this work, we observed how much hardship there is within the community and really wanted to continue and provide as much support as is possible. 

We have since been fortunate to receive some generous funding . The funding has enabled us to reach out to local schools, churches, council groups and other community organisations to identify families who would massively benefit from a food hamper during these difficult times. To date we have provided over 1500 food hampers to family’s within Northampton, and the demand for this support is increasing daily.

To continue to support the community and the increasing need, we are constantly looking for further support. As with everyone at the moment, we have no knowledge of when life will start to go back to normal, but while the pub is closed, we are determined to continue to support those who need our help."

Grocery shopping has become a whole new experience entirely and I don't think any of us ever anticipated having to queue up outside the supermarket for ages- only to get inside and find many essential items not available. Fortunately for most of us this is only a temporary situation. 

Sadly many families have been financially hit hard by the lockdown. In particular the Refugee and Asylum Seeker community have not been able to work in lockdown and are not eligible for benefits and furlough pay. They have had to rely on Food Banks because they can't afford to shop at the supermarket; and the demand for these services is growing rapidly. 

Barnet Refugee Services set up a Food Bank in North London (Edgware) at the beginning of lockdown to ensure Asylum Seekers and Refugee families don't go hungry. In their first week of opening they provided food packages to 120 households, and now there are over 200 families depending on this service.

Please help us to ensure the Food Bank is well stocked. 100% of all money donated will go to buying food and essential supplies for the Food Bank. 

Thank you so much for your support. "

The disease has led to measures beyond our wildest imaginations, including orders for self-isolation, concerns over the ability of public services to cope, major impacts on local business, and emergency legislation.

While no one has been spared from the fallout, there are certain groups who especially need our support. One of them is The Trussell Trust, which runs 428 food banks across the UK to provide emergency food to those in crisis.

The Trussell Trust and other food banks are under strain, with panic-buying and stockpiling only making things worse. Food donations have dropped sharply, especially some essential items, so the Trust now needs to buy them to make sure people coming to its food banks have what they most need. No-one should have to rely on a foodbank but the number of people depending on them is likely to increase because of the hardship caused by job losses and business closures as a result of the coronavirus​.

That’s why I am appealing for donations to The Trussell Trust, to help them ensure that the most disadvantaged in our society have enough to eat..


I know these are deeply worrying times, but I also know that we have the ability to pull together to get through this crisis. Together we can make sure that no-one is left behind. 

Thank you for whatever you can give.

The work that we do is adapting quickly in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. One of the most important changes to our offering is a new emergency food bank, to ensure that those who are vulnerable or isolated are able to access food and supplies during this difficult time.

Donations given through this fundraiser will go towards purchasing necessary items for emergency packages, and supporting distribution to those unable to leave their homes. Each session costs the organisation around £80 in food and deliveries - our target of £3400 would allow us to run the food bank for a full year, through this crisis and the months that will follow.

In this worrying and uncertain time it is crucial that those in our communities who are most vulnerable are looked after. Your donations will go towards ensuring that those in need have access to essential supplies.

Thank you so much for your generosity, and even if you can't afford to donate at this please share this fundraiser with others."

Bevendean Foodbank serves Bevendean, Moulsecoome, AND Coldean. This is a huge area for a weekly Foodbank. With the current COVID-19 situation, Kate recently attended an emergency food meeting for Moulsecoomb and Bevendean. The upshot is that Bevendean Food bank may have to close Fear not, though, as The Bevendean Cooperative Pub has closed as a pub and is now the identified main hub for the area in the Council's city wide emergency food plan. They will be coordinating deliveries of both food parcels and cooked food. They urgently needed funds to buy in initial supplies, to undertake a deep clean, to retain staff and, really urgently, to buy containers for cooked meals. This is why I have donated £1000 of this GoFundMe to them to enable to them hit the ground running and keep this vital support going during these unpredictable times. This does, of course, leave the GoFundMe in its last few hundred pounds. I have seen a spike in donations since Monday which is amazing and thank you all so much for your continued support. I am asking that you share this GoFundMe around as MANY PLACES AS YOU CAN so we can continue to support as many people as possible. Donating money to the fund is more helpful, and safer, than donating food. I can buy in bulk with more money and get better deals. I work closely with the Foodbank to get a list of the items they desperately need which ensures they are stocked with the right things all the time. I am not an “at risk” person so having just me out and about collecting and dropping food is safer than having many people donating.

I am running the Liverpool half marathon in March in support of South Liverpool Foodbank. Why have I chosen this particular cause? Here are some numbers...

- More than 11,000 people used SL Foodbank last year
- One in three children in Liverpool are growing up in poverty. In some areas of the city region, that rises above 50%.
- In the 2019 Indices of Deprivation, Liverpool ranked 2nd in England for highest proportion of neighbourhoods classed among the 10% most deprived nationally.

Food banks really shouldn't have to exist, but we have a government in this country which systematically perpetuates poverty and inequality, so sadly they're an absolute necessity for millions of people to live. 

It might be 21km worth of pain on the day, but it will be for a very important and worthwhile cause. Anything you can give is greatly appreciated.

‘Let’s Eat’ Community Foodbank 
Help us feed our Leeds community in the COVID-19 crisis Why are we asking for help?:
Chapeltown Youth Development Centre have identified a need to launch a new, weekly foodbank in Leeds 7 in direct response to the Coronavirus pandemic. Our local community urgently needshelp and support to tackle one of the very basic but very real challenges they are facing; that of feeding their families. 

Some young people and their families live in poverty all year round, but we are finding, because of the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, so many more are contacting us because they’re struggling with increased pressures on their household budgets. People who are battling with job losses, reduction in their incomes, wait times/not being eligible to receive benefits, an increase in utility bills etc during lockdown and ultimately children that go hungry. There are also vulnerable people in our community that need help; ie elderly, disabled, those shielding for health reasons or in self isolation who haven’t got anyone else to help them. We know these impacts will be felt long term.

Every penny you donate counts. It will help us achieve our foodbank project’s aims of reducing food poverty and inequality. It will help us tackle some of the very real challenges young people, the disadvantaged and vulnerable in our community are facing right now. Alternatively, you may have or work at a business that can offer us some support or help - if you have any ideas around this, please contact us at letseatproject@yahoo.com

We want to make a difference and help families put healthy food on the table, and we are grateful for any help you can give us to make this happen and make something positive come from this difficult time in the longer term. Thank you so much for your support ❤️

A Bit More About Us and ‘Let’s Eat’ Foodbank:
CFYDC (CHANCE) T/A Chapeltown Youth Development Centre are a Leeds based registered charity (No. 1121341). Our focus is on supporting young people to achieve their fullest potential in life. We do this by offering and subsidising a range of positive diversionary activities such as football, rugby, boxing, education and training opportunities and gang prevention work - regardless of background, race, religion, ethnicity, gender, disability etc. We have a high proportion of BAME community members that attend our centre and we work city wide, but have a focus on helping those in Chapeltown and the other most deprived areas surrounding us in North and North-East Leeds. We have been a part of the community we serve for around 20 years so far and have supported thousands of kids. We only plan for growth so that we can support many, many more young people to achieve their aims and become their best!


CYDC have the premises, the volunteers, the will and determination to deliver this project, not just during lockdown but long term so we can truly make a difference. To achieve this though we need your help to raise the funds to buy essential equipment such as suitable fridge/freezers (approx £2500) so we can receive more food and improve the food parcels, to improve our available storage spaces (costs for this are currently being worked up, but to give you an idea we need an extra storage container, shelving/tables/materials/labour etc), cover delivery costs for those that can’t come to us because they’re vulnerable/disabled/elderly/isolating etc, to buy bags, gloves, sanitisers etc and to stock up on food and household goods that families in financial crisis need support with getting at this time. We are working in partnership with FareShare Yorkshire. 
We want to make a community food store that can make a difference. This is a project that we have begun operating immediately to react to this crisis and meet the growing need for help for families to feed themselves, but also one we want to develop, grow and make sustainable in the long term. Locally and nationally the demand for support in communities to reduce food, child, and working poverty is, sadly, an increasing trend with no signs of slowing. We also want to break down some of the social stigmas in the community that are associated with the use of food banks and make it easier for families to get the help they need.

Usually our charity is able to generate some income through some of our already heavily subsidised youth activities (we offer our activity sessions e.g. football, rubgy, boxing etc for £2 a time) - but this has currently come to a crashing halt to keep people safe! Also a lot of the grants and corporate fundraising methods have been put on hold or are under severe strain due to increased demand. We have to find a different way of fundraising during COVID-19 - and let’s just say Captain Tom was an inspiration to us! So here we are, hoping you can offer your support.

Thanks for reading our appeal. If you can’t donate yourself, maybe you can share our story so someone else might help. Either way, we hope you all stay safe, well and blessed! ❤️ "

To prevent people in our community going hungry we are having to purchase additional food every week. 

We have no ongoing funding for the Food Bank apart from the 50p voluntary donation that users make for their food; and the supplies we get from FareShare, which whilst excellent, can not meet all our community's food needs in this crisis.

Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period, others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.

At the heart of Football is community, and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children, but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship, we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment, food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.

The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations, none of it is possible.

Whatever you can give, it all helps.

- We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank, with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.

- On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities, who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland. Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen feed people seven days a week and will now be able to buy pallets of fresh produce to cook with, whilst the foodbank will be able to use the money to produce emergency three day food parcels.

I work for an NHS Older People Community Mental Health Team; so my clients are generally over the age of 70 and have diagnosis such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and dementia.

Many of my clients are self-isolating, and lots of them have family or carers that are doing their food shopping, so they are well supported.

However, quite a few of our clients live by themselves or with their elderly husband or wife, with no other support. These are the people my colleagues and I are most worried about. They are unsupported and at high risk.

As you know there has been an amazing volunteer movement in response to Corona Virus lockdown. However, due to red tape issues the volunteers aren't being linked with our clients in need of this support as quickly as we'd like.

My colleagues and I have set up a mini food bank to help our most vulnerable clients whilst we wait for volunteer support to be put in place.

I know times are hard but please please give a donation, of whatever you feel you can, so we can help our most vulnerable clients live through their self-isolation.

If there is any food or money leftover after this crisis will be donating it to a food bank charity.

Thank you so much!!!!!"

As COVID-19 seems to take us by surprise day by day we feel like now is the right time to act as a community to help those most in need.

How will your donation help?

This particular service will help us supply food and essentials to the vulnerable and those most in need in Barton. We will personally be out buying and delivering the essentials to do our bit to help the community.

All food and other donations can be dropped off to the given address on our Facebook Page, which also includes more information if you are in need of our help.

We would like to stress that this is a totally non-profitable origination and that any left over funds will be going direct to the NHS.

"Raising money for in-patients and food banks","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.gofundme.com/f/raising-money-for-inpatients-and-food-banks,2743,10000,2020-05-13T07:38:24.0000000-05:00,04/18/2020,,,94,"My name is Mohini, I am a staff nurse looking after covid-19 patients. 

Although we are trying our level best in treating patients affected by covid-19 in hospital, I feel that there is a lot more we need to do to help these patients in hospital as well as those affected by this pandemic in the community.

Many people are temporarily out of jobs and are struggling to make ends meet. Basic necessities such as food supply and toiletries for many families has become a burden. Families are having to resort to food banks to ensure that their families have something to eat. However, food banks are also in major crisis as they are opening their doors to more people than ever before during this covid-19 pandemic. Provisions that they would normally be supplying per week is now being distributed within a day. 

At the same time, many patients in hospital are taking their last breaths of life alone without any relatives beside their side. Families are yearning to see and hear the voices of their loved ones fighting this disease in hospital alone. Yet, due to the highly contaminated nature of this disease, many hospitals are reluctantly having to stop normal hospital patient visiting times. Many patients with a background of dementia and/or Alzheimer's find it very difficult to understand why they are in hospital and what is happening to them. More so, being in an unfamiliar hospital environment without any families visiting them makes it even more difficult for them in aiding their recovery. It breaks my heart that families cannot come to see their loved ones knowing that they are in their last few hours or days of life. 

The reason I am setting up this fund raising page is to help both patients and families to be connected in the hospital as well as those affected by covid-19 in the community. The money we raise will be used for two primary causes:

1) To collect enough money to buy food and basic toiletries that can be distributed to local food banks to keep up the pressure of ensuring that nobody goes hungry during this covid-19 pandemic. 

2) To collect enough money to buy electronic ipads, phones and phone chargers for patients to stay connected through face-time with their families on the outside whilst they are fighting off this disease alone in hospital. 

Charity does not decrease one's wealth, in fact charity is like a flowing river, you can only gain from its clean water. ""The best of us are those who bring greatest benefits to others"". 




Thank you =)"

Elias Mattu Foundation had been helped by Lakshmi Sweet Centre Restaurant in Blakenhall, for hot meal on a daily base but needed others to come forward.

Some of the people we are helping are on benefits, and are elderly and vulnerable. A lot of them can't get out of the house because they are self-isolating and have no one else to do the shopping for them.

We are desperate to keep on supporting them but we need food donations.

The island is an island of tourism, many of the inhabitants come from the other islands in Cape Verde to work and rely on the wealth of the world for their survival. The island is poor at the best of times, relying solely on tourism. The wages are low but the cost of living is the same as the UK, if not more. Some essential items like Paracetamol can cost an average of £5 per packet, completely unaffordable by the locals. Like the rest of the world, the island is now in quarantine, but this means the islanders are not allowed to leave to travel back to their native islands and live with their families. Without tourism, the locals are without wages and money or financial aids to support themselves - yet are expected to live and survive on next-to-nothing. There have been a few charities set up and have already started to hand out some food to the families, but it's not enough. With majority of supplies coming from overseas and high demand, the local shops have doubled their prices, so food is considerably more expensive and unafforadable for most. My daughter, Chiara often says to me ""Mum, you can't save everybody"" and of course I know she's right. Whilst I know money is tight in the UK and around the world, I just cannot ignore how these locals, who depend on the rest of the world must feel. I feel compelled to try to help them, hence this ""gofundme"" page. The monies will go directly to the locals to buy basic food, of rice, vegetables, water and supplies and distributed to the families in need. I hope you will consider their plight and help, any small donation will help and be a significant difference to those who need it the most. There will be difficult months ahead until tourism replenishes the island again, but they are the most fantastic and beautiful hosts. The islanders of Boa Vista will welcome you and any guests with open arms, today and always - so much you will never want to leave their beautiful island. Lastly, I thank you for taking the time to read this on behalf of the locals whom depend on tourism for survival. Myself, like everyone else really hope we can all return to what was once normal life soon, but in the meantime let’s do our best to look after those who treat us with nothing but love and kindness. Much Love Bruna. This is a request for help, on behalf of Igor Tequila and the Islanders on Boa Vista https://www.gofundme.com/f/boa-vista-food-bank"

We are facing an unprecedented challenge and so any donation will be warmly welcomed as we continue to support those people most in need. Many of the primary locations used to donate food to are now closed, there are little or no opportunities to give food directly to the Foodbank BUT they still need stock. 

As the impact of coronavirus takes hold, and the knock on effect of unpaid work, unfulfilled contracts, zero hours workers getting literally zero hours, new universal credit claims, currently a six week delay, who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?. More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank, only to find that their shelves are empty too.

We don't know how COVID-19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy, society, communities. But poverty is already isolating, lonely, and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves, more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.

All the money raised here does directly to Ballycastle Foodbank who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger.

If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free.

The work this school is doing is phenomenal and I feel so privileged to be able to experience this, and I am already looking forward to the next 2 and a half weeks to come!

The object of the project is to teach English to the children in the village, so they have better job prospects than just rice farming, sweatshop work or prostitution. They also run a food bank project, helping some of the poorest families to become self sustainable and giving them food packages that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford.

The last few weeks teaching has been a real eye opener, and one of my highlights so far has been teaching my pre intermediate class all about women’s rights and gender inequality, they are so willing to learn it’s infectious.

I am asking for donations to be able to treat our children on Fun Friday, as lots of them have extremely hard lives and so this fortnightly treat is something they really look forward to! Any remaining money left over from fun Friday will go straight to the food bank project. 

Many thanks"

They have taken our main hard drive /pc all are password protected . They have obviously ransacked the office and damaged our filing cabinets. Along side the items we need to replace , they have taken around £200 that was donated over the Christmas period which obviously provides much needed funds for the day to day running of the foodbank. Food was taken too, so we are putting an appeal out for tinned fish, rice pudding, tinned fish , tinned tomatoes and uht milk. 
We as a charity can little afford the extra costs incurred to replace the more valuable items and office furniture. Any donations will be greatly received and used to help to wider community .


As stated our original target was £1000 and we have blown away by the generosity of the wider public. I am one of the merry band of volunteers at Oldham Foodbank. We offer assistance to those in crisis with food parcels for 3 days . As we have smashed our target , extra money raised will be used to enhance our current security systems to prevent ourselves from being targeted again . Furthermore the money raised will secure day to day expenses of the Foodbank for the foreseeable future , enabling us to continue to provide to those in need and crisis. 
All monies raised is to be transferred to Oldham Foodbank bank account which is run by our Trustees. 

Update on 17/5/19 

We are in the process of withdrawing funds , The funds will be withdrawn via the manager of the Foodbank and promptly transferred to the Oldham Foodbank account which the Trustees will be able to allocate funds as we require them .

She has kindly shared another story with us, that she has written about the Coronavirus. This is to, hopefully, enable us to raise funds for our food bank that has been extremely useful to those in need at this difficult time. Not only that, it has helped 71 families so far. If you'd like to, you can make a donation here, but only if this is feasible. The smallest amount of money can make the biggest difference. WE THINK THIS STORY IS BRILLIANT! We hope you enjoy it too!

Many people have already lost their jobs, or they are in a state of uncertainty while awaiting news, and self-employed workers are finding themselves in a similar position - many are asking for a referral to a food bank for the very first time.

We are getting reports from the ground that food donations are gradually slowing down, and so at Essex Coronavirus Action we are raising funds to provide immediate payments to a number of food banks around Essex for the purchase of food and supplies. We are also in discussions with a number of retailers to make sure that food banks can purchase the items that they are running short of, while still managing to respect the new guidelines about reserved shopping hours for those who need them.

Every donation will be held in a bank account in the name of the Essex Association Of Local Councils, in trust on behalf of Essex County Council, ready for direct distribution to local food banks across the county.

Essex Coronavirus Action is a collaboration between Essex County Council, The Essex Public Health Team, and local Facebook groups across Essex. For more information, please visit our Facebook page.

The demand for food packages is likely to increase as people are forced to leave their jobs, have a reduced household income and be completely isolated. I know it's scary and seeing others stock up on canned goods and toilet roll may be pushing you into wanting to do the same but I implore you to remain calm and think of others during this difficult time. If you are healthy enough to get to a grocery shop and buy fresh food please do so, if you have friends/family around you who could easily bring you groceries if you have to self isolate please do so, if you are able to utilise online shopping while isolating please do so and leave food on the shelves for those who desperately need it. And while I have your attention if you can please donate to this fundraiser so that I can I put together a donation for local food banks. I will be shopping carefully and sensibly, visiting different stores and shopping on different days to avoid wiping out a grocery stores dwindling supply of baked beans etc and I shall be trying to buy items with long shelf lives that are not currently in high demand.

We are an Ecuadorian family who wants to kick-start a fundraiser for the Latin American community in London, who have been directly or indirectly impacted by the coronavirus and find themselves and their families in crisis economically being pushed below the poverty line. 



What we would like to do?
We would like to raise funds so we can buy and collect food supplies and toiletries and give them to those who are in need in the Latin American community.
We need the funds urgently and continuously for the next three months at least whilst the covid-19 crisis stabilises. 


Why is this important?
As the lockdown in London began in a matter of days, we fear many Latin American people in London, equally as the rest of Londoners, are suffering greatly, many may have either lost their jobs as many work in hospitality and catering or may be waiting on what's next for them once lockdown eases. Many may be now below the poverty line suddenly. 


What do we need?
Cash donations allow us to buy food at low prices directly via our chain of suppliers
or
Food and toiletries donations
or
vehicles (cars, bikes, vans) to collect and deliver food and toiletries parcels


Support us!
We Latinos are supportive and charitable, welcoming to those in need, so let's get together turning an uncertain situation into an opportunity to help each other.
We hope that other Latin American organisations and institutions, leaders, such as Cllr Maria Linforth-Hall Southwark & Directora de “Su Mano Amiga”, Cllr Belgica Guaña, businesses and the normal Latin person in the street join us. Let the 'invisibles' be seen and help. We can make a true difference at this time and let's not forget we all need a hand sometimes.

We are very grateful for all your help! 
¿Quiénes somos?
Somos una familia ecuatoriana que busca poner en marcha una campaña de recaudación de fondos para la comunidad latinoamericana en Londres, afectada directa o indirectamente por la crisis relacionada al Covid-19. Existen miles de familias que hoy atraviesan un momento crítico económicamente y cuyas finanzas han sido empujadas por debajo del umbral de pobreza.

¿Qué nos gustaría hacer?
Estamos trabajando en la recaudación de fondos para poder adquirir y recoger suministros útiles para el diario vivir, como alimentos y artículos de aseo, para su entregárselos a las personas más necesitadas en la comunidad latinoamericana.
Para hacerlo, buscamos fondos de forma urgente con miras a continuar con la campaña los próximos tres meses, que serán críticos, y al menos hasta que la crisis se estabilice.

¿Por qué es importante?
Debido a que las restricciones en Londres iniciaron repentinamente, tememos que muchos latinoamericanos en la ciudad, igual que el resto de londinenses, están sufriendo mucho. La posibilidad de que miles hayan perdido sus trabajos debido a la naturaleza de sus empleos (muchos trabajan en el sector hotelero y gastronómico) y la incertidumbre sobre el futuro de ese sector laboral en los próximos meses acentúa este momento crítico y, de repente, los enfrenta a niveles preocupantes de pobreza.

¿Qué necesitamos?
Las donaciones en efectivo nos permiten comprar alimentos a precios bajos y más convenientes, directamente, a través de nuestra cadena de proveedores
O
Donaciones de alimentos y artículos de aseo
O
Transporte (coches, bicicletas, furgonetas) para recoger y entregar paquetes de alimentos y artículos de aseo

¡Apóyanos!
Los latinos nos caracterizamos por nuestra solidaridad, somos caritativos, empáticos y siempre damos una mano a quienes más los necesitan. Esta es una nueva oportunidad para reunirnos y convertir una situación incierta en una oportunidad para ayudarnos unos a otros.

Esperamos que otras organización es e instituciones latinoamericanas y líderes, como la Cllr María Linforth-Hall Southwark y Directora de “Su Mano Amiga”, Cllr Bélgica Guaña Newham, empresas y la persona latina normal en la calle se unan a nosotros. Que quienes hoy son ""invisibles"" sean vistos y nos ayuden a ayudar. Podemos hacer una verdadera diferencia en este momento al no olvidar que todos necesitamos una mano a veces.

¡Estamos muy agradecidos por toda su ayuda!

The food bank is available to all local residents, regardless of age. 

During the current Covid-19 pandemic, some food banks have closed and others are operating at reduced capacity. Many elderly and vulnerable residents are unable to rely upon their usual channels of support and many in the community have been affected financially due to the crisis and are unable to meet their basic daily needs. The Square Mile Food Bank is therefore a critical resource to ensure that those most in need can be provided with urgent, nutritious food supplies.

The food bank is volunteer led and relies solely on donations from members of the community, companies and other grant giving bodies. Any donation, large or small, will make a huge difference to ensure that we are able to reach as many people as need the service.

There are currently 14.3 million people living in poverty in the UK, and more than one in five people (23%) in Wales. There is currently an established network of Food Banks across South Wales. Run by hard-working volunteers from buildings such as churches and community centres, Food Banks provide a range of food and other household items to people in need. Food Banks rely on donations from churches, schools, supermarkets and the general public. However, due to the growing number of people living in poverty in our local community, many of our Food Banks are simply not receiving enough donations to meet the level of demand. So, how can you help? By supporting our cause, ""Communities Unite - Supporting our local Food Banks"", we can together increase the level of donations made to South Wales Food Banks and help those in need. From speaking to friends and family, it's clear that so many people would like to do more to support the vulnerable people in our local community, but simply don't know how. For example, you may not know where your local Food Banks are located, or their opening hours. Or you may not know what goods to donate (so many of the Food Banks are over-run with items such as Baked Beans but may be desperate for dried goods such as pasta and rice, or need other items such as toiletries and feminine hygiene products). So how does it work? 1. "" Communities Unite - Supporting our local Food Banks"" will collect money from the general public through individual donations to our gofundme page. Just donate what you can, even if it's only a pound or two. Every little helps! Although this will be an ongoing project, there is no commitment - you don't need to sign up to regular donations (although we'd obviously love your continued support). Just give what you can, when you can. 2. At the end of each month, we will take your donations and divide them into funding 'pots' for the different areas across South Wales. 3. Liaising with local Food Banks in each area, we will then purchase the items most needed by individuals in their communities, and deliver these goods direct to the Food Banks. It's as simple as that! ❤ PLEASE JOIN US IN UNITING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY - WE WOULD LOVE YOUR SUPPORT! ❤ ..........................................................

Hi everyone,

I hope this message finds you all safe and well.

I am currently at home on my own most days losing my mind in self isolation. As I sit here watching so many brave people in all sorts of walks of life putting themselves and their families at risk without a second thought, I have decided to do my bit and to raise funds for our local food banks here in all our local areas. These will include Middlesbrough, Thornaby, Stockton - On - Tees and Billingham.

I will contact each local food bank and ask if they would like me to take them stock directly or if they would prefer the cash so that they can prioritise exactly what they need.

All I am looking for is any spare change type donations which will go a long, long way to helping those in our local community in the greatest need of all.

If you are unable to donate anything just sharing this post will help raise funds for those who have fallen through the benefits system, or do not qualify for any of the government help.

I am kicking off the fund with a donation of £100.00

Thank you for your time.

Sergio."

Hi everyone we're Luke Howell and Lindsay Fraser , we're based in Shepton Mallet and each year try to do a shop for local food banks and charities to help those most in need. After a succesful shop for The Axminster Food Bank Christmas 2018 and another for The Salvation Army Christmas 2019, we were hoping to do one at the beginning of the year, however in the light of Covid-19 we feel like this is a critical time to pull together to try and support our local communities and those most vulnerable. 

Fundraising
We will be fundraising for several local charities and food banks to try and help boost their stocks during this uncertain time. We’ve chosen the following charities across Somerset to help our immediate community and local area; you can find out more about each chairty by clicking the linsk below:

100% of all funds raised will go directly to the charities; split equally and will be used in at least one of the ways below:

1. To purchase foods, toiletries, baby items, cleaning products and other key items required
2. Direct cash donations 

We have spoken to our charities and noted specific items from each, of which they are currently low on, this is posted below. Our local supermarkets and home stores have also been very generous in either allowing us to either shop out of hours or with a lift on some of the restrictions in place in order to maximise the amount of people we can support. 

How can I help?
We know this is a very difficult and surreal time, we’d be exceptionally grateful for any support, in any form. We know not everyone can justify extra expenses right now which is why we're also asking for direct donations of food, toiletries etc too. 

Drop off point: 
The Cheeky Bean , 12-12A Market Place, Shepton Mallet, BA4 5AZ

Please drop any donations into the café during opening hours Wednesday - Sunday, these will be collected daily, sorted and dropped off in parcels to the charities accordingly. https://www.facebook.com/thecheekybean

Did you know that 3,000 Nigerians die daily of hunger? Or that in borno state 64.2% of households are food insecure? 

A lot of people aren’t aware that approximately 61% of the population in Nigeria are living in poverty. We want to change that. Growing up in Nigeria and seeing poverty around us daily has made us understand how fortunate we are to have 3 meals a day. This is why we have decided to start a mobile food bank to help those who aren’t as fortunate. We hope to feed a minimum of 700 people in Nigeria this summer and continue this food bank during other holidays. 
 All the donations we receive will be going towards food supply and transportation.

These have all become luxury items nobody can seem to get their hands on without visiting multiple stores which not everyone can do.

Demand on resources has not been higher, so kindness, generosity and compassion for those around us in this time of need is more needed than ever before.

This has sparked an idea with the Digital Bees here at The Co-operative Bank - we must support individuals losing their jobs, vulnerable people unable to feed their families and anyone who is feeling the pain of the coronavirus pandemic which has hit the world. Food Banks feel huge pressures at Christmas, so you can't begin to imagine what they are dealing with to feed our nation. 

As an ethical bank, this is something we feel very strongly about and we to offer whatever aid we can to the Greater Manchester community.

To support the physical donation campaign we are running, we are also taking online donations via this page. 

“Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly and most underrated agent of human change” – we all have a part to play in making these dark times more bearable for one another so please give what you can to this amazing heart-felt cause.

We also hope we inspire those outside of Greater Manchester to follow our movement and support your local community.

Thank you,

I hope you haven't. But many, many see it often, and the need is growing whilst donations are shrinking. Demand over the last couple of weeks has tripled help has not. Can you donate just five pounds to help this crisis? My name is Andy and having lived on the streets, I know what it's like to be hungry and to struggle. I can in some small way understand the fear and worry people would face without this resource. As someone often in the church building, I see first-hand people (often not the ones we 'picture' in our minds), but everyday hard-working families, people like us, who just need a helping hand. SO I went to Tesco to buy some food for us hoping to donate some too. But there was no food to give so I thought I could give my donation in financial terms - thus allowing Yeovil Christian Support Trust to top up their own surplus and use my gift as they require. Perhaps you would consider doing the same. Could you spare a fiver to help top up the food bank and other groups the Lords larder helps. The church link is https://yeovilcommunitychurch.co.uk and the charity is www.ycstyeovil.org.uk and ALL donations will go directly to them... helping provide food parcels and support all manner of clients in OUR town. 
Because who knows in this day and age, when we may need it ourselves. Thank You. I've set the target but would love to see that broken - plus I'm happy to accept silly challenges for money!! Or to rope others in to help with this!!

Please donate what you can towards this food bank donation fund in order to aid individuals & families struggling to feed themselves as a result of covid-19.

No amount is too little to make a difference.

As a result of covid-19:

-Breadwinners have lost employment and their income.

-Low income families who previously relied on free school meals to feed their children will have to provide lunches, potentially for months, having had no time to plan or save for this extra expense. Parents will go hungry to feed their children.

-Elderly and vulnerable people are short on supplies due to a lack of availability in stores.

Please donate what you can towards this food bank donation fund.

You can do so via this fundraising page or in-store at Bradbury's butchers and deli Ravenshead Nottingham NG15 9BD

I've arranged a collection for Salford food bank. After facing closure and threat to their current premises earlier this year, they are currently in a precarious situation, and would benefit from the stability of additional donations. If you have any spare cash to donate, even £1 can go a long way.

The City of Salford currently have 4 foodbanks in Swinton, Eccles, Mocha Parade (central Salford) and Salford Quays. These centres are vital for the poorest people in our city - one neighbourhood, near Salford Crescent station, sees more than 50% of families with children living under the poverty line. 

According to the centre, hope is not lost, but more needs to be done: ""A volunteer team are in the process of implementing a short-term fundraising strategy to make sure Salford Foodbank can remain open beyond March 2020, and work is underway to develop a longer-term strategy in the new year.""

We appreciate that Christmas is an expensive time of year for everyone, however we wanted to do something for those who have nothing, and won't even have enough to eat over the Christmas period. Over a third of the UK's children are recognised as living below the poverty line, and we'd just like to try to make sure that some of those in our region get fed.

We'd therefore be grateful of any small change you can spare to support us. We've already raised over £100 between us, which realistically is the equivalent of a week's groceries for a family of 4, so any further support would be appreciated.

For full transparency, a photo of the receipt will be posted.

I fell upon a lovely couple based on Orford Park, warrington, who give up their time handing out food for absolutely zero profit and ask for nothing in return.
After a brief conversation with the couple I came up with the idea to give something back, in the form of using my skill set (being a chef).... 
Hence needing the afore mentioned items! 

What I’m trying to achieve is to break down the barriers and the stigma of going to food banks like this and make people realise that it’s ok to need help!

My idea is to spend the morning with the people who are collecting food and demonstrating the best way to utilise the ingredients, that are there on the day, and handing out free tasters of the things that I have made!

We are Forty Clothing from Glasgow, and we’re trying to do our bit during these harrowing times.


Every Saturday since the lockdown began, our Managing Director and DJ extraordinaire Harry has been entertaining our customers and followers alike from the comfort of his own home. For one hour a week he plays his favourite tunes in the hope of brightening people’s weekends while we’re all stuck in the house. We’ve also been trying to promote health and safety and social distancing through our social channels to all of our amazing followers and offering free gifts with orders placed on our website, as well as starting our weekly Big Forty Quarantine Quiz as our way of helping and putting smiles on the faces of others at this time.


But we realise that more has to be done. At this time, people and businesses are struggling. People have lost their jobs and their income, others have no childcare and support. Many people are struggling with both their physical and mental health. Key workers are risking their lives every day, often in low-paid jobs. Charities are losing out on the vital donations they need to maintain the incredible work they do. 


We’d love to help these people in some way, and for this reason we are raising money for a food bank drive. Food banks are there to help those who are struggling no matter the cause, and provide them with the basic necessities they need to survive. While times are tough for us all, food bank volunteers are continuing to do their bit for society, and although we all wish there was no need for food banks in our society the sad truth is that many people rely on them to get by - and at this time they may be more stretched than usual.


Every week we will support a different food bank. Using the money raised, Harry will buy and donate the items requested by the food banks on behalf of all the Forty Family. We understand that times are tough right now for many of us, but if you do have anything to spare we would massively appreciate your help. We’ll also keep you all up to date with the process so you know that your donation has helped and made a difference to the lives of people here in Scotland.

The first food bank to benefit will be Newarthill Food Bank - from Harry’s hometown.


In the meantime, stay home, stay safe, stick together and stay apart!

Thank you and we’ll see you soon, 

Forty Clothing ❤️"

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, we have drastically changed the way we are working. We have switched to delivery-only food parcels in Moulsecoomb & Bevendean, and have seen an increase in demand from the first week. With more than 50 households now on our delivery list, we are in constant need of food donations. Many kind people, organisations and businesses have supported us, but to make sure we are able to continue delivering to an ever-increasing amount of households in our area, we are now seeking more support to be able to buy in food and items we desperately need but not always get through donations. We know the need won't end when the outbreak and lockdown is over, and any funding will help us bridge to a way back to our drop-in sessions. We expect that even when the Food bank can open its doors again, and people can come out to socialise and get advice and support in person, the world will still look different, so we want to be prepared for this transition period. Your support is very much appreciated by community we support and the many fantastic volunteers we are supported by. THANK YOU from all of us at the Bevendean Foodbank Committee.

My friend Emma and myself are challenging ourselves this year and have decided to do our very first mountain climb. Scaling England's highest mountain, Scafell Pike. 

I know people who have to scratch about for money every month to be able to pay for bills and other essentials but, are still left wondering how to feed themselves and their children and it's just getting worse.... No one should have to do this but luckily there are food banks that can help out. I would like to raise some money so I can donate it to our local food bank ""The Cromer & District Foodbank"" to help them buy a few supplies. I don't know how much that will be but I hope anything is a help to them and the people that use the food banks.

Statistics taken from The Trussel Trust:

Between 1st April 2017 and 31st March 2018, The Trussell Trust’s foodbank network distributed 1,332,952 three day emergency food supplies to people in crisis, a 13% increase on the previous year. 484,026 of these went to children.

So if you are one of the lucky ones who can afford to spare a small amount, please think about sharing it with those who can't. Really, I would appreciate any donation. Plus, I need to get my bum up that mountain so please give me a little boost to get up there! 

The climb will take place on June 15th 2019 (weather depending).

Thank you

Love, Zoe x

PS: I hope to be the first person to twist a balloon dog at the top :D

"Support Lewisham Local Food Bank born from Barbers","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-lewisham-local-food-bank-born-from-barbers,385,2000,2020-05-15T14:08:53.0000000-05:00,04/22/2020,,,14,"Ziggy, the owner of Progress Barbers in Catford, Lewisham has done something well out of the ordinary...



Due to the pandemic, countless numbers of small and local businesses have been forced to close - with barbershops/hair salons being examples of the businesses that are suffering the most. Now, the normal response for the owner of a business like this would be to take advantage of rate relief, seek bridge funding for the business and also look for financial support being offered to people that are self-employed.

But not Ziggy...



Ziggy has converted the Barbershop into a Food Bank that is specifically focused on helping the elderly and other vulnerable members of the local community to have access to the food and sustenance they need in a time when it may be challenging to make trips to supermarkets or go shopping themselves.

We all know that local businesses like barbershops are massive pillars within communities as they are connected to so many people and aware of a range of local issues. So, who better and where better for a Food Bank to support vulnerable people to come from?



As it stands, Ziggy is not only travelling (on his own dime) to his shop, to the homes of people who cannot make it to his Food Bank and even spending his own money to buy food if he is short on donations from local people that are aware his Food Bank Exists. ALL WHILST HE IS LOSING MONEY AS HE CANNOT TRADE AND RUN HIS BUSINESS AS NORMAL.

So, now we need to support this local hero by helping to alleviate the financial pressure that comes from still having to maintain the utility costs at the shop, the transport costs that come with running the Food Bank and also to help access further food to support vulnerable local people."

Amy will hula hoop for 20 minutes every day and each day she will add something new to the challenge, such as reading whilst hula hooping!

Times are very hard during the current climate with the dreaded covid looming over, and the foodbank is as empty as it has been in a very long time. Shelves are bare and not enough donations being dropped off due to people isolating and keeping social distance rules.

What you see in the picture is what I've manage to rally the community to donate on my doorstop in just one day and will continue to put my baskets out and flood the world of facebook for another day.

Let's make this possible and donate what you can, you just never know when you may need to get help from the food bank, or know someone close that needs a helping hand. If your isolating and cant drop off but what to get involved, then donate what you can, it may save a childs life who is starving in poverty, help a single parent out, help the elderly, help one of your own.

If donating items works best for you please see a list below of things that are needed and where these can be left. If, like me, you're isolating at home, and feel you have money you can donate, then this will be gratefully received. I will post updates here and on the Galashiels Foodbank Facebook page (link below).

From Facebook...
""During this difficult time in history it's wonderful that so many kind people have given donations of food and significant amounts of cash.
Having cash reserves allows us to buy in fresh food.
We really need ongoing donations of food items e.g. dried rice, pasta, cooking sauces for rice and pasta, tins of cold meat as well as meat for heating e.g. meatballs, tinned vegetables, instant potato e.g. smash, tins of custard, rice pudding. Also packets of breakfast cereal, sugar, tea, jars of instant coffee.
Food donations are gratefully received in the front porch of St Peters in Gala and Holy Trinity in Melrose as well as the collection points in Asda and Marks and Spencers, and COOP in Melrose.
Many thanks for your fantastic support.

Through discussions with Camden council and Covid Mutual Aid groups, Hampstead & Kilburn Covid Community Relief is happy to announce we will begin operating a food hub service every Wednesday from the Jewish Community Centre London (JW3)

Our volunteers will collect and deliver food parcels (received from the Felix Project via Camden council) to the elderly, vulnerable or those in need due to financial difficulties and the consequences of imposed isolation.

What is Hampstead & Kilburn Community Relief?
Hampstead & Kilburn Covid Community Relief is a community-led volunteer group operating a buddy system since the commencement of government imposed lockdown. We match volunteers with people who need assistance with the delivery of essential items such as groceries and toiletries, collection of prescription medication, and the provision of emotional support to tackle the impacts on mental health resulting from imposed isolation. 

The group was set up by a small team of local residents on 14th March 2020 and quickly amassed over 300 volunteers as the community was keen to support their neighbours and communities during these difficult and uncertain times. We use geolocation to help identify the closest volunteer to anyone contacting us for assistance. By matching people in this way we aim to strengthen the sense of community and friendship both during the crisis and afterwards. 

If you or anyone you know is struggling financially and in need of food parcels please get in touch with us at covidcommunityrelief@gmail.com or phone 07384309912.

In addition to this service, we will continue to provide assistance with grocery shopping and collection of prescription medications.

Our aim is to end hunger and poverty in the UK

We support a nationwide network of food banks and together we provide emergency food and support to people locked in poverty, and campaign for change to end the need for food banks in the UK.

In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year.

We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK.
1
FOOD IS DONATED
Schools, churches/mosques, businesses and individuals donate non-perishable, in-date food to a food bank. Large collections often take place as part of seasonal celebrations such as harvest and Christmas, and food is also collected at supermarkets.

FOOD IS SORTED & STORED
Volunteers sort food to check that it’s in date and store itready to be given to people who are referred to food banks in crisis. More than 40,000 people give up their time to volunteer at food banks across the UK.

PROFESSIONALS IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN NEED
Food banks partner with a wide range of care professionals such as doctors, teachers, health visitors and social workers to identify people in crisis and give them a food bank voucher to access emergency food.
4
CLIENTS RECEIVE FOOD
People bring their voucher to a food bank centre where it can be redeemed for three days’ emergency food. Volunteers welcome people and offer them further support to help resolve the crisis they face."

We want to provide Infection Prevention and Control kits, food, and start-up capital for these special people.
Donations are 100% tax-deductible.


The effect of COVID 19 has affected 90 % of homes in the world negatively, with the rapid spread of the virus across the world, Nations have resorted to total or partial lockdown, and either way, it harms the economy. 

Third World Countries such as Nigeria are experiencing an increasing poverty ratio of 95.9% as well as hunger and crime rates. The most vulnerable are poor Nigerians who live previously on less than 1.25$ a day, widows and single mothers are the worst hit from this condition.

These categories of people are unable to purchase protective materials that can prevent the spread of the virus and their petty business capitals have been expended on feeding. This is because the majority of the people survive through daily means of income, E.g. Hawking, and petty trading.

There is a problem that we can help solve together right from now and we invite you to help us

This calls for a need for urgent intervention which is the morale behind the We Save Lives Africa’s aim to provide tangible food item, IPC(Infection Protective control) materials such as hand sanitizers, facial mask, gloves and startup capital for petty traders, hence the need to seek external support to address the challenges.

We love you

I was at the meet and greet and asked her to sign my cd cover. She must have heard me wrong because she made it out to Alice instead of Alex.
