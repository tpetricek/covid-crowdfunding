Profits from its Social Enterprise Cafes (in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen) contribute to the mission, with 1 in 3 of its employees having experienced homelessness, or extreme barriers to employment. In addition to the cafes, Social Bite also has a restaurant called Vesta Bar & Kitchen, on Monday afternoons the restaurant opens exclusively to people experiencing homelessness to dine for free.
Since 2017 Social Bite has ran annual mass sleep out events called Sleep in the Park raising almost £8m with a further 18,000 people taking part. This movement has helped pioneer some innovitate programmes to help tackle the issues of homelessness here in Scotland. The Social Bite Village launched in 2018; a total of 10 nest houses were built on dissused council land in the north of Edinburgh to provide a safe and secure community for individuals to take the next step in life -a positive solution to unsuitable temporary accommodation.
In 2018 Social Bite ran its first youth fundraising campaign called Wee Sleep Out, a campaign encouraging young peple aged 8-16 to give up their beds for a night in support of ending homelessness. 5000 young people took part raising almost £100,000.
In addition to the Village, Social Bite has also invested £3m into Scotland's Housing First Pathfinder project, aiming at housing over 800 individuals by 2020. Housing First has proven successful in other countires around the world - tenants receive full wrap around support and studies show that after two years, individuals are able to sustain their own tenancy. You can find out more, including a count of how many individuals have been housed so far in Scotland at social-bite.co.uk/housing-first.

The Andrew Clark Trust is a UK registered charity which was established in 2004 with the aim to help in the development of a rural community in Burma (Myanmar), in need of support for education and healthcare for children. Thanks to the donors in the UK and around the world, the Trust is able to sponsor young children through state education from primary school to further education in Burma. Our basic belief is that the route to development is only through education and that requires the support of healthcare. Helping people to help themselves through education and self reliance is the essence of the Trusts existence and we aim to channel all support from donors and sponsors to this end.

Profits from its Social Enterprise Cafes (in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen) contribute to the mission, with 1 in 3 of its employees having experienced homelessness, or extreme barriers to employment. In addition to the cafes, Social Bite also has a restaurant called Vesta Bar & Kitchen, on Monday afternoons the restaurant opens exclusively to people experiencing homelessness to dine for free.
Since 2017 Social Bite has ran annual mass sleep out events called Sleep in the Park raising almost £8m with a further 18,000 people taking part. This movement has helped pioneer some innovitate programmes to help tackle the issues of homelessness here in Scotland. The Social Bite Village launched in 2018; a total of 10 nest houses were built on dissused council land in the north of Edinburgh to provide a safe and secure community for individuals to take the next step in life -a positive solution to unsuitable temporary accommodation.
In 2018 Social Bite ran its first youth fundraising campaign called Wee Sleep Out, a campaign encouraging young peple aged 8-16 to give up their beds for a night in support of ending homelessness. 5000 young people took part raising almost £100,000.
In addition to the Village, Social Bite has also invested £3m into Scotland's Housing First Pathfinder project, aiming at housing over 800 individuals by 2020. Housing First has proven successful in other countires around the world - tenants receive full wrap around support and studies show that after two years, individuals are able to sustain their own tenancy. You can find out more, including a count of how many individuals have been housed so far in Scotland at social-bite.co.uk/housing-first.
