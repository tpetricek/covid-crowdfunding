industry  from editors  booksellers and authors  to publicists  agents and designers  are donating money to go towards helping the acute crisis in poverty and hunger amongst the least well off in the country.    We live in a nation where more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. The Trussell Trust has given out over 1.6 million packs of food supplies in the past year alone. Food Banks are not just a place to pick up essential sustenance  with cuts to community centres and frontline services they have also become mini-welfare and advice centres.    We're aiming to raise £5000 before Christmas 2019  which will go to the Trussell Trust. Your donation will directly help those most in need of support. It is vital that those working in publishing come together as a community and take action.    It is important to help those in greatest need but solutions must also be found to the reasons people find themselves in need of food banks.    The Trussell Trust’s CEO Emma Revie has indicated that the benefits system has been driving a rise in foodbank use– the charity released their State of Hunger 2019 report in November.    “This is the busiest six months we’ve ever seen – more people than ever before are being forced to foodbanks’ doors ” said Revie. “Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty  but currently thousands of women  men and children are not receiving sufficient protection from destitution. This is not right. But we know this situation can be fixed – our benefits system could be the key to unlocking people from poverty. We need to put money back into the pockets of people who most need our support. It’s in our power as a country to end the need for foodbanks. This can change.”        Thank you for your support.

can respond to increasing demand. We are facing an unprecedented challenge and so any donation will be warmly welcomed as we continue to support people most in need.    I am Rev Carol Bostridge  Senior Project Manager of Lewisham Foodbank  I live in Sydenham and have been employed part-time by the Foodbank for 5 years.     All donations given via this campaign will be used by Lewisham Foodbank to either purchase food for our clients or enhancing the service we offer (eg providing volunteers with gloves  setting up a delivery service for those self isolating and purchasing addition equipment as needed).     All donations will be given directly to Lewisham Foodbank which is part of a registered charity (Transform Network) and their trustees will oversee the spending of the money and produce clear accounts.",False

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.    All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.    If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free. Thankyou for your support.    The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need  providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.    All the best    Jack Monroe.

But the coronavirus epidemic will be a massive challenge for them  on a whole new scale. More and more people are going to need their help over the next few months.    People on zero hours contracts won't get paid.    Food will need to be delivered to the elderly and sick who are self-isolating.    If schools close  many children will lose their main meal and need to be fed.    And all this is happening at a time when the rest of us are going to the supermarket less and - let's be honest - thinking about our own food cupboards first.    So  here's a very simple way to help. You give money. Every time we get to £100 I ask the foodbank what they need most and go and get it. If things get really bad  I will organise a delivery. We all keep doing this over and over again until things get better.      Why aren't Fair Frome doing this? Well  they've got a heck of a lot on their plate right now and this is one way I can take the load off them. It's also easier for me to set up a fundraiser as an individual.    Who am I anyway? Good question  I have volunteered for the food bank before  and here I am with Lenka  their co-ordinator  in the food bank. Fair Frome know that I am making this appeal and are very happy to have the fundraising happen.      I will post the receipt on here every time I go shopping.    But if you're still worried  please do take some food to the Fair Frome collection points in Sainsburys  Asda  Frome Wholefoods and Barnardos instead.       Frome is a great community. Let's channel this and do our best to see all our town through the next few months.    ",True

As it is has been cancelled  The Blue Blades have challenged HUBC to a race on the weekend of June 13th and June 14th.

Reduction in food donations because of the change in shopping habits.    3. Self-isolation of some of our regular volunteers.

Funds raised are to be shared equally between two much needed food projects in our communities  these being Lumley Methodist Church who are cooking and delivering over 115 hot meals twice a week and Bournmoor  Fence Houses & Woodstone Foodbank who are delivering many many food parcels throughout our villages. Both projects are much needed in these challenging times for vulnerable people and families in need  over 30 volunteers are involved in total across both projects.  Both Tommy & Kevin live locally and are passionate about their communities  their 10k run will take place on Saturday 9th May  to make things a little more challenging Tommy will be wearing a weighted top and Kevin will be in uniform complete with stab proof vest.  Any support at all that can be given will be very much appreciated by all in this amazing fundraiser  every little helps. Kind regards  Alan",False

It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Robin Hood Fund has launched to support our city and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.    The Robin Hood Fund     Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.    In Nottingham we have a famous history of looking after one another. You could call it the spirit of Robin Hood - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.     So we are creating something called the Robin Hood Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.     Our city has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Robin Hood Fund has been set up for us to shine a light on these vital projects and help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.     Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that if possible you donate and contribute to the common good of Nottingham. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.    The spirit of Robin Hood has created something unique in our city  now is the time to reignite that spirit so please donate today if you can and if you can’t please help us spread the word.      * * *    FAQs    What can I do?    Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the vulnerable.     Where have funds been used?    Since the Robin Hood Fund started we have always had one goal  to raise as much money as possible to help those most in need.     To date; the following causes have been supported;     Since the Robin Hood Fund launched we have had one clear goal  to raise much needed funds to support the most vulnerable people in Nottingham during the Covid-19 crisis. Following an amazing response from the people and organisations of our city we have already exceeded all expectations in raising more than £75 000 which has been distributed - or is in the process of being distributed - to a number of charities and organisations undertaking such important work during these difficult times.      To date; the following causes have been supported:      Foodbanks (£20 000)    The Robin Hood Fund has distributed £20 000 in support of food banks across Nottingham. Working closely with Hope Nottingham and Nottingham Forest in the Community to deliver the wider support  food and supplies have been centrally purchased and then distributed to a number of different food banks  including: NG11 Clifton Foodbank  Meadows Foodbank  Grace Church  HOPE Nottingham  Bestwood & Bulwell Foodbank  Himmah / Muslim Hands  Arnold Foodbank and St. Ann’s Advice Centre.      Homeless Organisations (£10 000)    Emmanuel House was awarded £6 000 for additional specialist key worker support to boost its team at a time when Nottingham’s homeless community is at grave risk. This support is helping to ensure the homeless community are being placed into hotel accommodation as an emergency measure as hostels are very vulnerable to outbreaks.       There has also been £4 000 of support released to Framework to enable them to purchase essential items to the Homeless community in Nottingham. This included  but was not limited to  the provision of items such as mobile phones so that they can remain in contact with key workers and minimise the chance of these individuals being unable to stick to the government guidelines on social distancing.       Refugee Groups (£2 500)    Refugee Roots were provided with support to allow them to move from a model that required face to face contact  to being able to still provide support in a safe and socially distanced way.      In addition  Refugee Forum has been provided with funding for a destitution fund to ensure those with no access to support in other places can still get support.       Vulnerable Women (£4 500)    Nottingham Women's Centre have been awarded funding to help them to provide mental health support and online counselling  including training for counsellors to be able to provide online support.      In addition to this  further support was provided to POW Nottingham  an organisation supporting the rights of sex workers and those at risk of being exploited. This funding enabled them to purchase essential items including food and toiletries.      Disability Groups (£2 500)      With social distancing measures causing increased issues for the disability community in Nottingham  this support has enabled the Disability Support Nottingham organisation to increase its capability to provide phone support - in addition to welfare checks - to those in need.      Vulnerable Young People (£2 500)     Funding has also been provided to help support the amazing work of Nottingham YMCA  who are working with the most vulnerable young people in our city during this crisis. The support has helped to provide food and toiletries to those housed in supported YMCA and transitional accommodation.      Where will the funds go?    The most vulnerable people during this crisis and will be administered by the city council and delivered by people and organisations across the city that can help the most vulnerable.    Every Monday Nottingham City Council will administer the release of funds from GoFundMe to Nottingham City Council bank account. This means Nottingham City Council should  on average  have the money in the bank no later than Friday of every week.    Once in Nottingham City Council account the funds are ring fenced and held until the decision re: allocation has been made.    A working group  chaired by Lee Walker  will be set up to recommend how that branch of funds is released. This group is tasked with making the biggest impact possible whilst also being certain that the organisations in receipt a) need and b) promise to spend quickly ie. nobody saves the money. On Tuesday of each week the working group will have a paper approved by a member of ‘gold’ and paperwork will be sent to a small governance committee who are tasked with ethics and assuring the highest standards of governance and distribution.    Remotely the governance group will scrutinise and approve. Once approved Nottingham City Council agrees to distribute as agreed.    Money will then go out asap so groups and organisations are in receipt within 5 days. A one page press note to support and communication online to be transparent.      If I do donate will it go to those who need it?     Yes  100% of any donation will go to those who need it.    I want to help my local community; will this money be spent in Nottingham?     Yes.

I'll be getting the iconic ""Fat Ronaldo"" Haircut  which will be done in isolation with my wonderful partner  Kristine.- I don't think she's happy one bit!     I've got a receding hairline as it is  so what looks like a ridiculous haircut on Ronaldo will look even more ridiculous on me.

Our lives have changed radically with COVID-19 and we have also realised that even if we are still young  we can try to help those in need. It all started with a math challenge we had to solve. If we managed to solve it in a day  we would receive 100 pounds from friends of our parents! Enough to buy our dream dog! We sat down a whole morning and solved it. However  we both decided that other people need this money more than us in these difficult times. Especially food banks all over our country. So this is how it all began  we have now decided to take on as many challenges as possible and donate the money raised to The Trussel Trust. We hope that you will help us by suggesting challenges and donating money along the way. We are ready to tackle anything  sports  artistic  academic  culinary  linguistic  we will give it our best! Thank you in advance for your generosity!

We want to provide care bags with toiletries & sweets for when they need a quick boost on the go. We are hearing how hot & busy it gets  so this simple gesture will make a difference and remind them that the public do care. Of course  the best thing we can all do to help them  is stay at home and fully-respect social distancing. But many of you want to do more to say thank you and every £ will help. We know money is extra-tight for some families at the moment  so please give what you can or if you can’t give  please share the GoFundMe with others.

Also feedback from some healthcare workers is that they really appreciate the public support  but feel well-paid. So they would like people to help those less well-off in our community.     Thank you and please help us not only reach our target ASAP  but also go beyond so we can provide more care packs  and also donate to other foodbanks in the Pilgrim catchment area if we smash our target!

I am running the Liverpool half marathon in March in support of South Liverpool Foodbank. Why have I chosen this particular cause? Here are some numbers...    - More than 11 000 people used SL Foodbank last year  - One in three children in Liverpool are growing up in poverty. In some areas of the city region  that rises above 50%.  - In the 2019 Indices of Deprivation  Liverpool ranked 2nd in England for highest proportion of neighbourhoods classed among the 10% most deprived nationally.    Food banks really shouldn't have to exist  but we have a government in this country which systematically perpetuates poverty and inequality  so sadly they're an absolute necessity for millions of people to live.     It might be 21km worth of pain on the day  but it will be for a very important and worthwhile cause. Anything you can give is greatly appreciated.     https://southliverpool.foodbank.org.uk/",False

The need for supplies is greater than ever!     Coronavirus is spreading  so is the hunger.     Everyone is buying online now so whatever they used to collect from collection points now they can’t. Everyone is buying (bought) in bulk so now a lot of things are not in stock in the shops.     In honour of welcoming Ramadhan I thought to call Manchester Central Food Bank and ask if they needed anything. I went shopping and delivered the items to the foodbank today (Thursday 23rd April).       But  even with a budget of £200  I did not manage to buy even a quarter of the things that the Food Bank needed. I realised quickly I cannot do it alone. The volunteers are already spending their own money but that’s only 10% of the donations. The other 90% comes from public donations which at the moment is very low.     If you want to give out in charity because of the blessed month of Ramadhan then this is your chance too.     Make sure you donate and help us provide essential food for our local community in Manchester Foodbank.    £10 can buy 5 - 10 items  £20 can buy 10 to 20 items  £50 can buy 30 to 55 items  £100 can buy 55 to 85 items    Thank you for supporting me in helping our community.     Thank you on behalf of Manchester Central FoodBank and everyone that will benefit from the Food Bank.     Find a Food Bank    Stay safe always.     Najma    UPDATE:  I did another food shop on Thursday (30th April). We bought items worth £450 and delivered to the Foodbank. We had a small car and so we could not spend all the money on this day.     We will be doing the Third Big Shop on Thursday (7th May) with the leftover but this time I have partnered with Bankeut and they will do the shop and delivery on my behalf for free.     I’ll also be doing live daily recipe demos on Instagram (sikiacooking) and/or Facebook (sikiacooking) from Sunday (3rd of May) to Saturday (9th May). Simple recipe ideas to try at home.",True

We are raising money to help provide a free meal to those people and families In Dunfermline who are struggling at this difficult time.     Dunfermline Foodbank is doing a wonderful job as is ""Food for your Future."" However  there is still a great need. Some parents struggling with stress  anxiety and mental health even find it difficult to prepare a meal.    We are aiming to provide 100 FREE meals per day to those who are in need. We are collaborating with local High Schools and primary schools to get the offer to those who could do with a little helping hand right now.    Sometimes the hardest thing for us all to do is to receive a little helping hand from time to time. We are all in this together and we are coming together to try and help in some small way. The sharing of what we have with others is what binds communities together and makes them stronger.    With that in mind we are offering free meals to those in need on a TRIAL 6 DAY period from Tuesday 12th May to Sunday 17th of May.    This had been funded by generous donations and by the Vine church because we all #loveDunfermline.    We are also looking into applying for government funding to do this on a medium to long-term basis.

I'm raising money in aid of Malmesbury and District Foodbank and every donation will help. This Sunday (19th April) I will be doing a full Ironman Triathlon in my garden. This will involve me swimming in a paddling pool for about 1.5 hours  cycling 112 miles on a static Wattbike and then running 26.2 miles - which will be around 420 laps of my garden.    For the swim I will be tethered so will be static... think of it as 1.5 hours of front crawl but never being able to reach the end of the pool    I am starting at 7am and hope to finish my 7pm!    Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to me. So far I have raised around £400 via Facebook and PayPal but know a few people have had some issues with these platforms so have brought it together here    More information about Malmesbury and District Foodbank: Malmesbury and District Foodbank provides emergency food parcels to those in food poverty.

The disease has led to measures beyond our wildest imaginations  including orders for self-isolation  concerns over the ability of public services to cope  major impacts on local business  and emergency legislation.    While no one has been spared from the fallout  there are certain groups who especially need our support. One of them is The Trussell Trust  which runs 428 food banks across the UK to provide emergency food to those in crisis.    The Trussell Trust and other food banks are under strain  with panic-buying and stockpiling only making things worse. Food donations have dropped sharply  especially some essential items  so the Trust now needs to buy them to make sure people coming to its food banks have what they most need. No-one should have to rely on a foodbank but the number of people depending on them is likely to increase because of the hardship caused by job losses and business closures as a result of the coronavirus​.    That’s why I am appealing for donations to The Trussell Trust  to help them ensure that the most disadvantaged in our society have enough to eat..      I know these are deeply worrying times  but I also know that we have the ability to pull together to get through this crisis. Together we can make sure that no-one is left behind.

This brought an end 85 years of football under the club's name.    In April 2019  however  we celebrated the establishment of North Ferriby F.C. as the successor club to North Ferriby United. Les and Gill Hare  after 4 years away   have returned to create a new club which will start this season in the Northern Counties East League Division One. It'll be great to have community football back in the village!     As it turns out  2019 is the centenary of football in the village  so we have lots to celebrate.    We at View from the Allotment End   North Ferriby F.C.'s independent fanzine  are seeking to raise funds for the club and our chosen charity for issue 12 of our magazine Hull Foodbank  which is part of the Trussell Trust.    The first game of the new club will be a pre-season friendly against local friends and rivals  Barton Town F.C on 6th July 2019. A number of us fans are planning to walk the 6.5 miles from North Ferriby  across the Humber Bridge  to Barton Town to watch the match (K.O. 3pm). We expect it will take about 2-2.5 hours.     As part of this we are seeking your kind sponsorship. All money raised will be split equally between North Ferriby F.C. and the Hull Foodbank.    Also  we welcome anyone along who wishes to join us - Ferriby fans  football fans  or fans of a good walk over the finest bridge in the world. Final details are being confirmed but we expect to leave North Ferriby in the late morning. If you wish to join us please e-mail Matthew Kempson so we can keep you informed - [email redacted]. We will also post updates on our Twitter and on here. We are considering arrangements to get back :)    And of course  we would welcome supporters down to North Ferriby F.C. this coming season. Up the Villagers!    Finally  please do check out the great work that Hull Foodbank undertake and help them directly if you can.

London may not be having a marathon this year  but Didsbury will! Not only that but  collectively  the residents plan on beating the current ""official"" world record of just over 2 hours while also adhering to strict social distancing measures!    We'd love your support. Please sponsor/donate what ever you can  all monies raised will go directly to Burnage Foodbank.    Here's how we will ensure Social Distancing:    This event is for residents only. Unfortunately non residents will not be able to spectate as there is no where to put them while ensuring social distancing.    Key points - Warm up (outside YOUR OWN) house from 9:45am    1st leg starts 10am – Participants will be notified of their group and approx. start time by Whats app!    The race will follow VERY STRICT SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES  to do this we really need all cars etc to be off the road by 9am on Sunday 26th so the road can be used as the course. We appreciate this can be tricky especially where homes have more than one car. To help  we have contacted The Parrswood Pub to see if we could perhaps park in their car park. If this is something that may be of interest/use to you  please let me know so I can confirm details.    Participants be they  Walking/Jogging or Running will start outside their own house (level with their left fence post) they will step onto the road/the course and will then will travel in an anti-clockwise direction  going down one side then up the other. Their lap (s) will finish when they return to their house. This will mean people are kept safe and social distancing will be adhered to at all times! Partipants will use the outside of the road allowing a 2m gap between them and runners running on the other side of the road.     Participants  participate at their own risk.     The footpath will act as a barrier between runners and those spectating/supporting from their drive. Supporters  please ensure you are a minimum of 2meters away from where participants will be passing ie. A minimum of 2 meters from the curb.    3 or 4 people (or in some cases 3 couples or 3 families will participate at the same time) participants will be in groups (allowing for social distancing) and will be given a start time. 1 lap is 451 meters so this will more than allow for social distancing between each participant/houshold. Those running with children under 10  should hold their hand when participating to prevent trips/falls and ensure they don’t jeopardise social distancing measures.    Participants will be categorised (by themselves) into Walkers/Potterers ie. Joggers with kids under 10years  Joggers and Runners and will participate (at their allocated slot) with others in the same category. Overtaking shouldn’t be an issue anyway but to be clear  participants will NOT be allowed to overtake!    Any questions please ask.",False

5","Christmas is one of the toughest times of the year for lots of people. Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland. Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen feed people seven days a week and will now be able to buy pallets of fresh produce to cook with  whilst the foodbank will be able to use the money to produce emergency three day food parcels.

who have been struggling since the Coronavirus outbreak. Last week alone  they helped 285 families and they expect this to increase in the coming weeks. Some of our players and friends of the club  will run a combined total of 200km in one day (this Saturday 2nd of May)  and each individual will contribute with either a 5km or 10km  also ensuring the governments social distancing guidelines are adhered to.

We at CIG are very lucky people  we work for a company that cares for us and pays us and allows us to work from home.     With the care packages sent out i was thinking that there must be a lot of needy people needing support with food and care during this trying time and rather than sit there and wait for someone to help i decided to start this charity drive to earn a little of money to give to the stockport foodbank charity  they currently have 7 locations in stockport and help all people who are in need of extra  not just during this trying time but always.

The food bank is available to all local residents  regardless of age.     During the current Covid-19 pandemic  some food banks have closed and others are operating at reduced capacity. Many elderly and vulnerable residents are unable to rely upon their usual channels of support and many in the community have been affected financially due to the crisis and are unable to meet their basic daily needs. The Square Mile Food Bank is therefore a critical resource to ensure that those most in need can be provided with urgent  nutritious food supplies.    The food bank is volunteer led and relies solely on donations from members of the community  companies and other grant giving bodies. Any donation  large or small  will make a huge difference to ensure that we are able to reach as many people as need the service.

I am raising money for the Foodbank NI and CAP (Christians Against Poverty) service in TLC compassion centre in newtownards. The Foodbank provide vital food packs for people who find themselves in various difficult circumstances. It is estimated that 1 in 5 people in Northern Ireland live below the poverty line. As a result an increasing number of people in Northern Ireland  and across the UK  rely on the emergency food supplies provided by food banks. The CAP centre help people find a practical  lasting solution to debt and poverty. Living in debt and poverty is a daily grinding battle. But together we can transform lives.  Anything you can donate would seriously help people in these circumstances feel loved and find hope again   many thanks   Lyns",False

We are understandably gutted. Not only is Canned Laughter incredibly fun but all proceeds from ticket sales go directly to the local food bank in the area the gig is put on in and right now food banks need our support more than ever: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-51837892    All ticket holders will be offered refunds. But ideally we would still like to raise the money we would have made in ticket sales from these two gigs to help the two food banks they would have supported.    We have set our target amount roughly at 80% of all available tickets sold to both events which would have been £2 560. We will split any money raised from this drive between Eat or Heat  The Waltham Forest Food Bank (Canned Laughter - April 25th) and Euston Food Bank (Canned Laughter: Karaoke Roulette - April 4th)    We thank you so much for your support.

We are so excited about the prospect of bringing this old Grade II listed building back to life! It was originally built in the early 1900’s as a Temperance Hall  since then it has had a plethora of uses  most recent of which left the building in a semi-derelict condition which included severe fire damage.    However  following its acquisition by The Tab Church  fresh ideas began to surface as to how it might be rescued  restored  and adapted to suit the needs for modern usage as Church  Community and Conferencing facility.    The ‘Tab1Milli’ is what will enable this most significant part of the Big Build project vision to become a reality  and the building actually able to be used.    But we can’t pull this off without your generous support because this is the largest financial project The Tab has ever undertaken.    We are therefore asking you to join with us through radical generosity  as together we step out in faith towards hitting the £1Million target by continually bringing our financial gifts together now and over the coming weeks and months.    Once the entire building is renovated  it will enable The Tab to continue and expand its traditional church functions and community initiatives  which are not limited to but currently include:  · Sunday services  · Kids church for children  · Crèche during the Sunday services  · Weekly prayer meetings  · Christian education and classes  · Administrative offices  · Bookshop/resources  · Food Bank – hosting Lewisham Central’s foodbank and distribution point. This is currently offered two-three times a week  staffed by 8-12 volunteers.  · Youth mentoring – support for vulnerable young people in the local community.  · Community action team (Restoration Empowerment and Community Help) – which focuses its support and resources on three vulnerable groups in Lewisham:  The elderly (offering days out and grocery food supplies);  The homeless (offering food clothing to those living on the streets)  and  Women and children escaping from domestic abuse (offering support).    *The Big Build Project includes the overall vision of Tabernacle Global Ministries and therefore maybe used for general purposes....",False

We demand the University of Birmingham:  * Gives an above RPI inflation pay increase to all support staff;  * Becomes a Living Wage Accredited employer;  * Eliminates the gender pay gap by 2020;  * Fixes the Support Staff pay spine & allocates a budget for it;  * Negotiates with all unions on the joint unions' report on working conditions at the university (available on our website).    Hundreds of caterers  cleaners  security guards and other support staff who are members of UNISON at the University of Birmingham are in dispute with the University of Birmingham and have taken strike action on the University's Open Day on Friday 28th June as they feel let down by the University’s senior management. Unless the University of Birmingham's senior managers are prepared to address our demands  we will have no other choice but to continue to take strike action.     This strike is notable within the sector  as this is the only union branch in the Higher Education to succeed in taking strike action over the 18-19 negotiations. This comes after almost a year of failed negotiations over fair pay  living wage accreditation  closing the gender pay gap  and meaningful negotiations on a joint report of demands written together with the other trade unions on campus  says UNISON today. More than three quarters of the university staff balloted (79 per cent) voted in favour of strike action over last year’s dispute.    Senior managers at the University have persistently refused to negotiate with the unions and instead imposed a below inflation pay rise (2%) on the majority of staff. The University has also been sluggish to address the gulf between men and women’s salaries at the institution  with women earning on average less than 20% than their male counterparts  have refused to accredit  and have only been ready to restructure the pay spine if the unions were prepared to agree on worse conditions such as sick pay  overtime pay  and holiday entitlements.    The first day of action was held on Friday 28th June  on a very sunny day which was also the University's Open Day: food  music  and joyful discussions over everyone’s vision of the University are being held  and prospective students and their parents are finding out about the struggles staff are facing on campus.     In the absence of accreditation  pay at the university could fall below the Real Living Wage  meaning staff would struggle to make ends meet. ‘We already know that members have turned to foodbanks to feed their families’  says UNISON. ‘Many low-paid staff only work 15 hours per week and often hold several jobs to make ends meet. Senior managers seem happy to promote the excellent research undertaken by academics on social inequalities but are failing to see that they are often driving this inequality through the way they treat their own employees’.    Last year  the University set up a new ‘wholly-owned subsidiary company’ called the Edgbaston Park Hotel  and outsourced 40 staff. The Hotel does not recognise unions for new members (meaning that they cannot take strike action  for instance)  and new staff are being paid only £8.21/hour. Their contracts are much worse compared to those of the University of Birmingham’s employees.

Our family were in awe by his altruistic desire to give  feed and aid ALL  despite race/ethnicity/religion among him even whilst suffering himself.     Since opening  our family alone have vetted 25 families with monthly food rations from December 2019- present. Unfortunately  25 families do not cover the innumerable amount of people starving  for whom we want to share some light  hope and nurture to amidst dark times  that is their indefinite reality.    Our foodbank prioritises poor families with children  single mothers/widowers and those who themselves or their children suffer with debilitating mental/physical health issues trying to make ends meet to provide for their children- this is done with rigorous checks by our team to ensure nobody exploits such a service. The families are issued with a monthly ration card valid for 12 months which provides them with stock for each month as per the individual needs of the family. These include: 10kg chapati flour (atta)  5kg sugar  5kg various lentils/daal  5kg rice  5L cooking oil  tea leaves  salt  spices and other necessary food items. £25 will feed a family of 5 for the month however any donation  no matter how big or small will impact them greatly.     100% of the donationsgo to those in need  with our incredible staff being voluntary workers (so no wages or salaries are deducted from donations) and our facilities funded with the finances that the late Safdar Hussain Shah left behind for us to carry this out in his legacy- we are relying on your kind donations which will solely provide stock for the families.     During the current COVID-19 crisis  we are aiming to try and provide emergency food supplies to all those suffering in the locale  with the most vulnerable holding priority  we are giving out thousands of food rations but are broken to see that we are unable to extend our help to everyone that needs it- as a small start-up charity  we are grateful for all the support and donations we receive in order to help us reach as many individuals suffering from the crisis as possible.     Unfortunately  we can't do this alone  with the power of unity together we can help fill the stomachs of the poor  not only with food but also the fulfilment of life and hope they may gradually receive from your donations. Our brothers and sisters around the globe need us  we are united by our efforts.   Any donation  no matter how big or small will be greatly appreciated especially in the blessed month of Ramadan  whereby charity is considered its greatest.     We are not the givers  we are just Allah SWT  the Almighty's  servants and can only give what he allows and wishes to be given. The families we aim to feed is by the grace of Allah SWT and it is he who provides to all.     May Allah SWT accept this from you and me  may we fulfil our duty by helping those in need  for which it is their right upon you and I.    “A man’s true wealth is the good he does in this world.” Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W)    Instagram: sadaqajariya.foodbank for further updates",False

We have been operating since 2012 in London and became a charity in March 2020. Information about SWAN can be found on our website www.swanlondon.org. We run a foodbank and provide community support to many Refugee and migrant families in London. We have also been providing aid to refugees in Camp Moria since 2018 in partnership with Kitrinos Healthcare and Team Humanity who are both charities registered to work in Greece. We have collected  sent (via container) and provided vital humanitarian aid to Refugees in Moria camp including food parcels  baby milk  nappies  clothes  shoes and blankets and documented the distributions on social media (WhatsApp). Team Humanity are our implementing partner on the ground and they have distributed regular food parcels to new arrivals on our behalf. In recent months there has been a dramatic increase in the number of new arrivals and conditions are horrendous. Many families are living in inhumane conditions with little or new food. Since November 2019 SWAN - with the help of TEAM HUMANITY has been providing bread (which is prepared by Refugees) in the camp to starving refugees in and outside Moria Camp. The cost of preparing each bread is 40 cents. €400 provides 1000 breads. There are currently 21 000+ refugees in Moria and many new arrivals have no funds and the queues are so long for the food provided by the Greek authorities and local charities that many get nothing. All funds received for this campaign will be sent to our implementing partner Team Humanity to pay for preparation and distribution of the bread. The ground team send pictures of each distribution to SWAN which we share with donors for transparency. The bread we distribute is often all they will eat. SWAN aim to provide bread three times a week - £1200. If we could do more we would. But we are a small charity dependent on your support.

It was later discovered that John had suffered a brain aneurysm.         Since John’s (Riveley's) passing the family has been inundated with hundreds of messages. Friends  family and loved ones from every aspect of John’s life have been reaching out with sentiments of their own grief and reflections on his life. Upon meeting John  one would immediately discover a gentle  friendly man whose warmth  cheerful demeanour and genuine kindness is unmatched. John touched so many with his humble  unassuming and selfless acts of service. Wherever there was a need you would find John there  not as the centre of attention  but a driving force to make things happen. What you would have also been aware of is John's deep love for God  and that in all things he put his trust in Him to direct his life  no matter what the circumstances. John leaves behind Julie his wife of 18 years and two young sons Caleb and Joshua  aged 8 and 11. John had a big heart with lots of love to give and also leaves behind two current foster sons and several previous foster children who remained a regular part of his life. John was born on the beautiful island of Mauritius and leaves behind his precious mother affectionately known to many as Grandmère; four siblings  Jenny  James  Donald and Shirley (Little Sis); three neices Karisa  Saphea and Nia; and two nephews  Courtnei and Joseph. John was a role model father and devoted son and brother with his eye keenly fixed on the needs of everyone in the family. John’s untimely passing has unfortunately happened at a time when so many are facing emotional and financial challenges. Millions around the world can relate to our experience of sudden loss. Just over a week ago John’s wife would never have expected to face the significant void that John’s death has left in her life. There have been many offers of support and this go fund me appeal is a practical vehicle for individuals to reach out to Julie  Joshua and Caleb at this difficult time as the family makes arrangements to lay John to rest.       The first video attached provides a tiny glimpse of the unfailing love that John had for his children. His youngest son Caleb  attentive  loyal and constantly by his Dad's side  ready to lap up whatever fun and laughter naturally radiated from the heart of his father.       In the second video attached you will witness a celebration of life. The strength you will see as John’s Eldest son Joshua pays tribute to his father publicly within two hours of hearing the sad news of his passing is remarkable. Joshua’s faith demonstrated through his confidence and composure in the face of such loss is a testimony and a legacy of the life of his father Riveley John Michael Choyen. Joshua’s performance flowed out of love for his father and actively testified to the neighbouring community that we mourn  but not as others do  because like our brother John we have the blessed hope of life eternal. John will be sadly missed  but we know that Jesus is coming soon and we will see him again.      Just one week later Joshua and Caleb participated in an online concert “Songs of Hope” to raise money for their local NHS hospital (Croydon University Hospital) and the local foodbank. Their parents have instilled strong values of giving back to the community and these commitments were made before the tragedy struck. In spite of their own grief the boys faithfully participated in the concert dedicating their performance (clip provided below) to their beloved dad.    ",False

We are hoping for 180 people to donate £3.25 each which will pay for enough rice to complete  not one  but two rice challenges!     Every 90kg (90 bags) pays for the farmer in Malawi to send one of his children to secondary school for one year! Education is key in helping families to beat poverty  and a secondary education is so important in helping to achieve that. Sadly  however  this is not an opportunity that is open to all children in Malawi  particularly children in rural  farming communities. We want to help change that by providing farmers with a living income through the sale of their delicious fairly traded rice  as well as giving them the opportunity to send their child to school!    But what are we going to do with all that rice? Every bag purchased will go directly to the Grace Foodbank in Sheffield  which feeds some of the city's most vulnerable and impoverished families.     We know that life is tough for everyone at the moment  but for those in poverty  whether at home or abroad it is even tougher. Why not help two lots of people today and purchase a bag of rice for just £3.25?    Thank you so much for your support!    #fairtradeeveryday",True

Each lap is approximately 770 metres  so this will see me cover 100 socially distanced kilometres in 24 hours. All money raised will go to The Trussell Trust #foodbanks    The plan is to run 100 laps on day one between 12 pm and midnight  which will be pretty much back to back marathons. I'll get some sleep  then finish the final 30 laps by midday on the following day. My final lap will be at 11:55 am on the 9th; all being well.... lap number 130.     Due to the current situation food banks are in desperate need of donations  support and help. If you can spare a couple of quid  it would mean the world to both me and this incredible charity. #milesformeals    I'll be posting live updates on Instagram via my mental health support page - Run4YourMind. Please give me a follow  support me and help me make a difference.

Currently  there is a huge need to help support the food banks  as so many people are needing additional help  to put food on the table  which is where the idea came from.    Many people leading up to the bank holiday would be planning where they are going to stay overnight camping or in their vans or on holiday  sadly for the VE-Day weekend that can no longer happen. So why dont we celebrate at home ?    So the idea is simple plan your trip based at home  prepare everything you need to go camping  stay overnight on the drive in your van  a tent in your garden  or even in your house (but it must be set up like a camping trip)  or in your caravan.     So how do we raise funds ?   Donate a minimum of £5 in the pot or the amount you would normally have paid for a night camping at your favourite spot during the bank holiday weekend.

With the current situation we find ourselves in due to Covid-19  I have been inspired by the things we have seen our communities doing for each other. Within those communities  you have individuals who may shop  cook or even cut grass for people at risk or our key workers  but then you have pillars of the community such as the Greyfriars that do so much more. Not only do they help individuals with foodbanks as an example  but they are an important part of the Irish heritage and support the community in more ways than some realize. The Greyfriars has been the host to many an amazing night with some great memories with our friends and family. The team are like family to us all  and I know my late mum thought the world of that place and the people that run and drink there  and she always had a great judge of character. If my mum was here now  she would be doing anything she could to help the club and keep it open  she had such great time for that place and the people involved behind the scenes (obvious soft spot for Paul ) With the club being so important to our community  I want to help them as much as possible to allow them to continue to offer what they do for us all. So  that being said  from Monday 18th I am going to challenge myself to run 100km in 30 calendar days to raise as much money as we possibly can for the Greyfriars. That’s 25km a week give or take… as I write this  i am slightly worried for myself. I am just under 20stone and nearly 40 years of age… very much out of shape  so this is going to be a huge challenge for me. I know my mum would be supporting this and be proud of the fact we are pulling together  so when I am hurting (and it will hurt)  this will give me the inspiration I need.

We have closed our doors to the public  and at the moment it seems like that could be for some time  but the bills keep coming in.     Over the past year and a half we have done our utmost to help as many other not for profits and charities as we could  we have ran clothes swaps  foodbanks  toybanks  our booksforbairns program  and so much more. The icebox was never  and will never be  about the money. It's a labour of love for our fantastic team  but with no money coming in from events to pay the large overheads we find ourselves very close to closing. We wont allow that to happen  not with so much work still to be done.    Our team will keep striving to stay open  we don't intend to go anywhere if we can help it  but we could do with a little bit of help to stay open. Every penny raised will go to pay the bills for the next 2-3 months  (the staff manning the not for profit side of things will do so voluntarily) anything above and beyond that amount will go right to buying food for the foodbanks we have worked with in the past  hell  we intend to keep doing our foodbank runs right up until they tell us we need to stay at home ourselves!

My name is Stan Intihar and I am a high school English teacher (and part-time illustrator) here in Edinburgh.    As the situation here (and around the world) worsens  the level of suffering for the patients AND the medical staff trying to help them will become increasingly obvious.    For years I have been involved in the Parent Council Cafes at the schools of both of our children and I have become *moderately* adept at baking scones (insert cheezy smile emoji).    Having 3 asthma sufferers in our family  we have received excellent care from the NHS over the years. Now I plan to show some thanks by setting up a wee ""Scone Stall"" at the exit of the Royal Infirmary at Little France. Upon the presentation of an i.d. badge  the holder will be entitled to a scone (plain  w/ butter  w/butter & jam and gluten-free  if there's enough demand). I will also be asking these staff members what kind of provisions/items would be helpful from a roadside stall. I hope the stall will then expand and develop so that we can show these people that we are behind them.    I will be in need of flour  butter  milk etc.    In addition  I am trying to raise awareness of the situation by designing a number of stickers which will be given away for free. As with the scones  I am only interested in covering my costs. This whole operation is NOT FOR PROFIT. If this is of interest  please check out my web site for updates:     www.stinkdesigns.com    And  depending on the response  I will donate any surplus funds to the Trussell Trust Foodbank.    And...if you want to become directly involved  please get in touch via my website.    If you've read this far. Thank you.    The NHS needs us. Let's show them some love.    Cheers   Stan.",False

Since the outbreak of Covid-19  we have drastically changed the way we are working. We have switched to delivery-only food parcels in Moulsecoomb & Bevendean  and have seen an increase in demand from the first week. With more than 50 households now on our delivery list  we are in constant need of food donations. Many kind people  organisations and businesses have supported us  but to make sure we are able to continue delivering to an ever-increasing amount of households in our area  we are now seeking more support to be able to buy in food and items we desperately need but not always get through donations. We know the need won't end when the outbreak and lockdown is over  and any funding will help us bridge to a way back to our drop-in sessions. We expect that even when the Food bank can open its doors again  and people can come out to socialise and get advice and support in person  the world will still look different  so we want to be prepared for this transition period. Your support is very much appreciated by community we support and the many fantastic volunteers we are supported by. THANK YOU from all of us at the Bevendean Foodbank Committee.

My Dad  James Yule  recently turned 81 and  being on housebound lockdown for 12 weeks  he decided to do Couch to 5k on the back garden path.    (When my friends heard about Major Tom’s 100 laps for NHS  they thought it was my Dad!) Why?  Someone  BP  from a group he’s on  posted on the group page that - even though James didn’t ask for it - BP wants to sponsor him to complete his challenge  and he offered a donation to a charity of James’s choice!    This gave James his altruistic idea - That if people would like to encourage him to do it  by way of sponsorship  and other people can benefit from what he’s doing  then why would he get in the way of such generosity?!    As food and basic health needs are so fundamental/crucial for the people in the world who are most struggling  he would like the raised monies to go to the local food bank and/or care needs in the community.  St. Andrews Foodbank says:    “Those we serve may have lost their job  had a family split up  be victims of domestic violence  or had benefits delayed or suspended. In desperate times we are able to meet their immediate need for food.”  May we extend our human kindness to them.    How?  So  to make it easier for you to give  if you feel inclined  I’ve set up this page.    I will post updates between now and the end of May  by which he hopes to be able to complete a 5km run  actually running  for the half hour that the programme builds runners up to (and do the remainder by whichever means)!    What makes this a challenge  you might ask?   Doesn’t James do the Parkrun?    Indeed  James has done the Parkrun  before  and consistently since my Mum died  a year ago today  20th April.    He also has angina  a heart condition which makes running that bit more challenging for his body. So he will be doing it gradually/sustainably.    His mind/heart  whilst keeping it fit and agile - as well as desiring to support other people in the community to be well and healthy - is determined. How can you help?    With the challenge food banks face in receiving food from their usual sources (church congregations  supermarkets etc)  you giving money to this cause will ensure food banks are stocked  and people who need the support they offer can still access it.    Thank you for your generous support and donations.    Amitaśūrī  and James    ",False

I have been keeping these two jerseys to one day get framed and put them up on my wall. They mean a lot to me as anyone who knows football will know the magnitude of “that” game. During lockdown I made a decision to put them to a good cause and raise money for people who really need it most. I will always have the memories and with help from everyone we can hopefully raise a nice amount. Please donate or purchase a ticket. We can all play a little part so all donations are welcome but to enter its £15 for one ticket. No limit on tickets purchased.     Stay safe and healthy    Thank you    Billy xxx",False

The fall off in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that we have had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased our costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries.

In light of the circumstances  we wanted to help raise money for a fantastic cause. Newcastle Staffs Foodbank provide food for those who cannot afford the essentials in what is a very tough time.     As a squad we'll be covering the 274 miles from Wembley stadium to our post match pub  the Black Bull by Longbenton sports ground in the week between the semi and final. Each player will be covering just over 16 miles from Wednesday to Wednesday. Judging by player fitness during the season  this might be a struggle  especially with a few of the lads taking it easy during quarantine.

Her funeral is on 15th June. Unfortunately we can't safely have any other mourners  but a few people have asked whether they could make a donation in her memory. A lifelong Labour voter - despite having issues with pretty much every leader! - mum was a huge supporter of food banks. She could never understand how it was possible for such a supposedly wealthy nation to have so many people living in poverty. And the idea that people struggled to feed their children broke her heart. Times are hard  and no one knew that more than my mum. But if you're able to make a contribution  no matter how small  that would be wonderful.

As the lockdown is eased  some people will be more aware than others that the pandemic is not over.    The most vulnerable people - those who have been shielded  have been receiving food parcels. They have been advised that they no longer have to shield beyond August 16th. We believe that this means that they will no longer get their weekly food parcel.    We are also aware of other people who for whatever reason  can’t get enough food. Predictions are for greater economic squeezes  which means that more people will fall into this category.    Prior to covid  the office of Leanne Wood in Porth had worked with the free-share scheme to offer free food to people who wanted it: this is food that the supermarkets would normally throw away. This food was provided on a non-means tested basis to anyone who could make use of it. (We also worked closely with the Rhondda foodbank to provide non-perishable food to them that they could make use of for people in need).    This scheme has to be put on hold when covid broke because it was not possible to do it while social distancing.    Social distancing is still an issue  but food poverty and food need is a growing problem. With the shielded group no longer having their weekly food parcel from mid August - and with supermarkets sending food to landfill if it can’t be distributed - all means we need to restart the scheme  but do it differently.    This is where you can help.    We need to raise money - around £5 000 should enable us to operate a scheme up until the end of the year.    We can then purchase extra items so that together with the supermarket excess  we can make up balanced food parcels for anyone who asks for one.    We will be relying on our team of Plaid Cymru councillors as well as the network of volunteers to both pack food and deliver it to people throughout the Rhondda.    If you can donate and also share this link on your social media channels  that would help this new project immensely.    Back in March  nearly six hundred people in the Rhondda responded to a call-out to sign up as a community volunteer  to be a part of a network to support and keep an eye out for others in their community as the covid pandemic took hold and people had major concerns about lockdown.    Some of those volunteers carried out weekly shopping and collected monthly prescriptions for their neighbours all the way through lockdown. This Rhondda network demonstrates what a fantastic community we live in. People here have been through so much with floods  precarious economic conditions  the loss of so many important local services - yet we still band together to help those who need it.    If you live in the Rhondda and you would like to be involved with this project in other ways  please e mail me - [email redacted]ru",False

My name is Charis and I'm a student from Warrington  who also swims for the Warriors  my local swimming club. For many people across the country  these last few months have been even more challenging than normal  and more families than ever now have to rely on foodbanks to feed themselves.     In partnership with the NCS (National Citizen Service Trust)  an organisation that encourages youth to give back to their communities  and WYC (Warrington Youth Club)  during August I will be swimming the equivalent distance of the English Channel crossing (approx 33km) over four open water sessions at Salford Quays with Uswim. The picture below is of me swimming under The Detroit Swing Bridge at Dock 9  Salford Quays. I want to challenge myself and raise awareness for less fortunate families that find themselves struggling in these unprecedented times.     To support my mission  please consider donating as this will provide food for those who really need it. The smallest contribution can make a huge impact on somebody's life. I think it's important to look out for others  especially now  and I feel honoured to be part of something special.    Over the course of the swim  I will be posting updates and photos on my progress as proof of my accomplishment.    More information about Warrington Foodbank: We provide three days' nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are in crisis.

A Benedictine Priory for nearly five hundred years  and then a parish church serving primarily the poor for just over three hundred years  the Cathedral now serves as the mother church of the Diocese of Swansea. It has a rich heritage that includes a gloriously carved medieval font  an arrow sharpening stone possibly used for the Agincourt campaign  and the regimental colours of the South Wales Borderers  including those from the battles of Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift. It is described in in the Pevsner Architectural Guide for Powys as ""pre-eminently the most splendid and dignified Church in Mid-Wales."" More importantly  Brecon Cathedral is a living community that continues the daily round of prayers  including Choral Evensong  and excellent worship while also serving the needs of the diocese  Brecon  and the world. We are actively involved in supporting the Brecon Foodbank and other charities  and in 2018 started the Convivium initiative to encourage thoughtful engagement between faith  heritage  and the environment. The Cathedral  however  faces serious financial problems. A medieval building is expensive to run and maintain. Even before COVID-19  the Dean and Chapter found it difficult to meet daily expenses. Additionally  the Cathedral roof is in increasingly poor condition and requires in the near future more than a million pounds worth of repairs. Thanks to COVID-19  the financial future of the Cathedral is now even worse thanks to the cancellation of services  concerts and other events. If you are someone who values the heritage of this building or the role the Cathedral has played in Brecon and Wales  or you would like to help maintain our Christian mission and ministry then please consider giving generously in support of our fundraising campaign. Future generations will be grateful. ",False

The individual /individuals have taken tablets that were used for referrals to the fuel bank to enable those in crisis to receive an emergency payment and for a nationwide surveys into foodbank from Edinburgh university. They have taken our main hard drive /pc all are password protected . They have obviously ransacked the office and damaged our filing cabinets. Along side the items we need to replace   they have taken around £200 that was donated over the Christmas period which obviously provides much needed funds for the day to day running of the foodbank. Food was taken too  so we are putting an appeal out for tinned fish  rice pudding  tinned fish   tinned tomatoes and uht milk.   We as a charity can little afford the extra costs incurred to replace the more valuable items and office furniture. Any donations will be greatly received and used to help to wider community .      As stated our original target was £1000 and we have blown away by the generosity of the wider public. I am one of the merry band of volunteers at Oldham Foodbank. We offer assistance to those in crisis with food parcels for 3 days . As we have smashed our target   extra money raised will be used to enhance our current security systems to prevent ourselves from being targeted again . Furthermore the money raised will secure day to day expenses of the Foodbank for the foreseeable future   enabling us to continue to provide to those in need and crisis.   All monies raised is to be transferred to Oldham Foodbank bank account which is run by our Trustees.

They each grew up in poverty and it is still a daily concern for themselves and their families  especially now with the economic impact of COVID-19.  They are motivated to help others who need food and health support.  They all have a physical disability due to either birth defects  illness  or accidents (landmine  traffic  industrial etc.).  They all aspire to be community leaders  not for recognition or glory  but for their love of the people in their community.    Phnom Penh to Siem Reap - 251 Kilometers over 4 days    The Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 fundraising ride departs from Phnom Penh on Thursday 16th July and finishes in Siem Reap on Sunday the 19th July.

The shop supports and celebrates the work of people and artists living with disabilities.     Having lost her job with the closure of the shop since the outbreak of the pandemic  this incredible and inspiring woman  with her own disability  is devoting her time and amazing efforts to help some of the most vulnerable families in the community with Essential Care Food Packs.    Naret is one of the amazing 9 Cyclists riding in the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event to raise money for the Siem Reap Food Bank that her and many other volunteers founded in April to support vulnerable families in need of food support due to Covid19.       Your Generous Donation Today Can Help by Feeding a Family of 4 for 80 pence a Day with the Siem Reap Food Bank.    The Basic Care Food Package costs just £26 pounds  which can feed and help sustain an average family of 4 people for one month!

The GoFundme Tip is voluntary and you can change the default tip amount when you donate. The minimum donation amount is £5    There are so many families that need your help more than ever  with your kind and generous support your donations (no matter how much you can afford to give ) means we can help keep their physical and mental health intact throughout this Covid19 Pandemic by helping them survive  whilst offering them a glimmer of hope for the future.     Siem Reap Province - Cambodia    Siem Reap is a beautiful idyllic tourist town just a stone's throw away from the spectacular Angkor Wat Archeological Park in Cambodia.    ""If you have ever been to Siem Reap  or Cambodia in general  you will know how warm  friendly  kind and compassionate the Khmer people are"".    Since the lockdown began  hardly any tourists are visiting the city  with visitor numbers to the Angkor world heritage site down by 99.5%  only 650 people visited the Temple in the month of April  that's 20 people per day compared to around 5 000 back in January.    This situation has created a major problem in Siem Reap. The average wage in the city for people who worked within or in connection with the tourist industry is around $4 USD per day  that's less than $3.50p for around 10 hours work or 35 pence an hour.    The city is more or less totally deserted with literally no visitors  there is no money being spent  no income….nothing…zero. As you can imagine  if you were only earning $4 a day ""in normal circumstances""  then you can probably understand why many families really don’t have any ability to save money to help themselves get through the times when the going gets tough…really tough.     There are many reports of people hearing children crying themselves to sleep at night through hunger.     Many families are trying to live off the land by foraging for fruit and vegetables  frogs  snakes and Rats etc  but the basic essentials that we all take for granted in the UK such as Rice  Eggs  Cooking Oil  Salt and Sugar are products that thousands of families in Siem Reap simply can no longer afford.     Real Hunger exists  in Siem Reap Province  because a large number of families  living at or below the poverty line  do not have enough money to consistently put food on the table.    Job losses  due to Covid 19  have pushed the total number of hungry families to an estimated 20 000. That means as many as 80 000 souls in the Province  are going bed hungry tonight without knowing where there next meal will come from.    Why the Siem Reap Food Bank?    Having lived and experienced an amazing life in South East Asia for over 18 years  I wanted to contribute in a meaningful way  to help some of the most vulnerable people through the ongoing Covid 19 crisis.    After many discussions with my wonderful friend  Christopher Leonard who is currently living there and witnessing first-hand the stone cold reality of the situation  we decided together to spend considerable time researching and validating food giveaway programs currently operating in Siem Reap.    Christopher  spent quality time with Naret and Rick and we could both see that with more money  international awareness and resources  The Siem Reap Food Bank could reach out to so many more families in desperate need of support.    The Siem Reap Food Bank continues to make a real sustainable difference to people in risk of extreme poverty and hunger.     So I decided to volunteer my time to support this incredibly important project and I wanted to share with you why I have chosen this specific Food Bank.    The Siem Reap Food Bank initially launched in April to provide Essential Care Food Packages to people living with disabilities to help them survive the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.     The Siem Reap Food Bank support families headed by or including people with a disability  that have seen their livelihoods disappear  along with the tourists and shops  restaurants  hotels and businesses being shut down.    With the situation continuing to get worse it soon became clear that the Siem Reap Food Bank would not just need to support families with disabilities through this unprecedented time  but any families identified to be in urgent need of an Essential Care Food Package to help them survive.    How Your Kind Donation Helps These Families:    Below is one example of a family the Siem Reap Food Bank is helping every month with a £26 Essential Care Food Package:    Mai Lin  a single mom of 4 children  all under the age of 12  suffered a paralysing stroke about 5 years ago. At the time  she was overwrought with fear that she would no longer be able to take care of her babies.     However  she learned how to make shopping bags from old newspapers and the income generated was sufficient for her to support her family and was even enough to send her children to school. Mai Lin’s income dried up completely with the closure of the Genevieve’s Fair Trade Village shop that sold her products  at the onset of the CoVid19 shutdown.     Along with her first food drop  just before Khmer New Year (April 13th 2020)  came the promise of monthly food drops until she is able to get back to making a living for herself to ensure her family survives.      What's Contained in a Monthly Essential Care Food Package:      We only need 1 000 people from across world to donate as little as as £10 pounds (less than then the price of a few takeout coffees) to succeed in reaching our campaign goal to support 100 families.    Please  help us meet our funding goal by making any donation you can afford.     We know that this is very tough time for many  so if you are unable to donate funds can please help us by sharing this appeal in any way you can via ( social media  friends and family as well as any networks you have connections with) help us create awareness and momentum for this ongoing humanitarian crisis.    On behalf of the families you are helping  thank you for your kindness  you really are making a life changing difference.    Myself and Christopher are volunteering for the Siem Reap Food Bank  with Christopher managing the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event and I'm helping to create awareness for the gofundme campaign.     GoFundMe does not operate in Cambodia. Therefore  I started this campaign in the UK on their behalf with a Funding Goal to support 100 families that's 400 hundred people we can help and support over the next six months.     We project that at the very earliest tourists may return to visit Angkor Wat  in December 2020.    Be kind - Be Loving - Be Safe    Akhun Charan (Thank you very much in Khmer)    Brian Taylor & Christopher Leonard    Important information about how funds for this campaign are being processed & delivered to the Siem Reap Food Bank    I am a volunteer for The Siem Reap Food Bank  I'll be assisting them with social media campaigns to increase UK and international awareness. GoFundMe does not operate in Cambodia. Therefore  I started this campaign in the United Kingdom on their behalf to assist them to help an many families as they can.     I solemnly pledge that 100% of all funds raised through this campaign site are automatically transferred to my UK Bank account and then transferred directly into the Siem Reap Food bank ABA bank account in Cambodia.     HOW DONATIONS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED    Our goal is to make sure the Siem Reap Food bank has continuous cash flow to purchase food & other essential items throughout the coming months  therefore monies will be transferred to their bank account on a regular basis.     The Siem Reap Food Bank Use of Funds: To purchase and distribute essential food and health items for families in need of food support living throughout the Siem Reap province.    Essential costs: To pay for the products being purchased and supplied  plus a few dollars for delivery.    The Siem Reap Food Bank accounting is up-to-date and open to inspection. ​    Donor Fees​ - GoFundMe adds a default Tip of 15% to each donation to help them maintain and improve their free platform.

Back at the start of March a local Ottery St Mary resident floated an idea on social media. Her idea was to create a volunteer team to help the “at risk”  elderly  self-isolating and key workers in our community.     From that seed of an idea  in one week over 400 local residents signed up to join and selflessly come to the aid of those around them. Ottery Community Volunteers (OCV) became a reality. Now a unregistered Not for Profit organisation the group has already mobilised to provide vital support to the local community.     What is the purpose of the group?     OCV have three key objectives:     • To establish and sustain for an extended time  a volunteer force capable of supporting our community.     • To minimise the transmission and infection rates of Covid-19 by reducing the footfall within our community and supporting people in isolation.     • To maintain a robust and enduring volunteer operation for as long as is needed  resilient enough to support our community.     What are we actually doing for our community?     The volunteer network is already operational and working in our community. We have divided the volunteer network into priority areas:     Pharmacy Group – collecting and delivering prescriptions for the target people.     Deliveries Team – focused on doing shopping for food & essential supplies  delivered to homes for those self-isolating & vulnerable  reducing the footfall of people in town.     Befriending Group – working alongside the Ottery Help Scheme we offer befriending telephone support for those in need of someone to talk to during their isolation    Foodbank Team – Our volunteers also work with Ottery Foodbank  supporting their essential efforts.    Mental health wellbeing service to our volunteers  run by volunteer healthcare professionals.    Finance team - Using prepaid cards to minimise the use of cash and the risks for transmission of Covid-19  as well as ensuring robust financial accountability.    Why are we fund raising?     Whilst OCV has already started work  up until this point we have relied upon a great deal of good will from volunteers and businesses. In order for us to offer a safe  sustainable  efficient and professional service for our local community we need funding. We recognise that there will be a requirement for active community support for many months to come. We will be using the funds raised to cover a wide range of budgeted costs including:     • Safeguarding training including Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks for volunteers     • Insurance    • Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)     • Volunteer out of pockets expenses including mileage claims     • Stationery & consumables    • Software licences     • Printing and postage    • Staffing & resources    Thank you.",False

Our local community urgently needshelp and support to tackle one of the very basic but very real challenges they are facing; that of feeding their families.     Some young people and their families live in poverty all year round  but we are finding  because of the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis  so many more are contacting us because they’re struggling with increased pressures on their household budgets. People who are battling with job losses  reduction in their incomes  wait times/not being eligible to receive benefits  an increase in utility bills etc during lockdown and ultimately children that go hungry. There are also vulnerable people in our community that need help; ie elderly  disabled  those shielding for health reasons or in self isolation who haven’t got anyone else to help them. We know these impacts will be felt long term.    Every penny you donate counts. It will help us achieve our foodbank project’s aims of reducing food poverty and inequality. It will help us tackle some of the very real challenges young people  the disadvantaged and vulnerable in our community are facing right now. Alternatively  you may have or work at a business that can offer us some support or help - if you have any ideas around this  please contact us at [email redacted]    We want to make a difference and help families put healthy food on the table  and we are grateful for any help you can give us to make this happen and make something positive come from this difficult time in the longer term. Thank you so much for your support ❤️    A Bit More About Us and ‘Let’s Eat’ Foodbank:  CFYDC (CHANCE) T/A Chapeltown Youth Development Centre are a Leeds based registered charity (No. 1121341). Our focus is on supporting young people to achieve their fullest potential in life. We do this by offering and subsidising a range of positive diversionary activities such as football  rugby  boxing  education and training opportunities and gang prevention work - regardless of background  race  religion  ethnicity  gender  disability etc. We have a high proportion of BAME community members that attend our centre and we work city wide  but have a focus on helping those in Chapeltown and the other most deprived areas surrounding us in North and North-East Leeds. We have been a part of the community we serve for around 20 years so far and have supported thousands of kids. We only plan for growth so that we can support many  many more young people to achieve their aims and become their best!      CYDC have the premises  the volunteers  the will and determination to deliver this project  not just during lockdown but long term so we can truly make a difference. To achieve this though we need your help to raise the funds to buy essential equipment such as suitable fridge/freezers (approx £2500) so we can receive more food and improve the food parcels  to improve our available storage spaces (costs for this are currently being worked up  but to give you an idea we need an extra storage container  shelving/tables/materials/labour etc)  cover delivery costs for those that can’t come to us because they’re vulnerable/disabled/elderly/isolating etc  to buy bags  gloves  sanitisers etc and to stock up on food and household goods that families in financial crisis need support with getting at this time. We are working in partnership with FareShare Yorkshire.   We want to make a community food store that can make a difference. This is a project that we have begun operating immediately to react to this crisis and meet the growing need for help for families to feed themselves  but also one we want to develop  grow and make sustainable in the long term. Locally and nationally the demand for support in communities to reduce food  child  and working poverty is  sadly  an increasing trend with no signs of slowing. We also want to break down some of the social stigmas in the community that are associated with the use of food banks and make it easier for families to get the help they need.    Usually our charity is able to generate some income through some of our already heavily subsidised youth activities (we offer our activity sessions e.g. football  rubgy  boxing etc for £2 a time) - but this has currently come to a crashing halt to keep people safe! Also a lot of the grants and corporate fundraising methods have been put on hold or are under severe strain due to increased demand. We have to find a different way of fundraising during COVID-19 - and let’s just say Captain Tom was an inspiration to us! So here we are  hoping you can offer your support.    Thanks for reading our appeal. If you can’t donate yourself  maybe you can share our story so someone else might help. Either way  we hope you all stay safe  well and blessed! ❤️ ",False

Although some goods are donated  they are mostly bought through local shops and we need funds to buy fresh fruit  vegetables and dairy produce.    If we still have money left from this campaign once we are no longer in operation  all outstanding money will be donated to Stroud and Wotton Foodbanks.    If you know anyone who would benefit from a WAMA Box during this difficult time  they can easily apply for one by Clicking Here to fill out one of our forms  or by calling 07545 042794 to speak to one of our volunteers.    If you know of anyone who would like other types of support like picking up shopping  delivering prescriptions or receiving a friendly phone call from a neighbour  you can request that on the number above or by Clicking Here to fill out our request for help form.    If you request a WAMA box  we will keep your information confidential and will only share it with a very small team of WAMA Box delivery volunteers.    We know that many people will look to family and friends for assistance during the COVID-19 outbreak  and Wotton Area Mutual Aid group is here to make sure that no one is left alone  by connecting people in need  with volunteers who are available to help out.",False

Homelessness is soaring. Hunger is spreading. We need not only food banks - but foodbank warehouses to feed desperate families. The most vulnerable are being stripped of the benefits they desperately need. The Tories’ austerity is destroying lives.    This is not justice. It’s a Tory choice. It’s not acceptable. It’s not inevitable. And there is an alternative.    The story of the West Midlands is becoming like a ‘tale of two cities’. There are cranes in our skies. But our homeless neighbours are sleeping in the doorways beneath  where someone now dies every fortnight.    Our society feels like it’s ripping apart. Brexit has divided us. In its wake  hate crime and violent crime has surged. Communities no longer feel safe. Islamophobia and homophobia are spiralling while the far right goes on the march.    Meanwhile  our economy is failing a generation. Over half the people in poverty in the West Midlands are in work. Half our wards are in poverty. Youth unemployment is up by a 20% while apprenticeships have collapsed. For thousands of our young people  their possibilities in life are defined by the post-code where they’re born. And looming above the crisis  is a climate that is warming faster than we thought  posing an existential threat to generations to come.    We cannot stand by and watch this happen. We cannot be by-standers. And we cannot let the Tories make it worse. If we don’t take a stand today then ten years from now  we will be more divided than ever in our history. There may be gleaming office blocks and fortunes for some. But inequality will spiral. Entrenched poverty will deepen. And the West Midlands will fall further and further behind London and Manchester.    Find out more here!    ",False

Starting on May 25th  we will strive to cover the 1889km by any human-powered method we can - be it walking  running  cycling or even swimming if we can get access!     And we'd love to raise funds for the North Guildford Foodbank along the way. Supporting families in our local area who need a little extra help  particularly at this difficult time. It will certainly motivate us to know that we can help others at the same time as challenging ourselves  and to know that you are cheering us along as well.

If such a basic necessity is hard to come by  then things like books are often seen as a luxury. Foodbanks all over the country see a surge in cases of families in need  particularly during the school holidays when things like free school meals  and breakfast clubs aren't running. This can put massive financial pressure on parents who are already 'tightening their belts' to provide for their families.    With this in mind  our aim is to provide the children  whose families receive Foodbank parcels  with a bundle of both fun and educational books to see them through the school holidays.

The initiative is focussed on activities that benefit the community within Blackpool and the surrounding area.    Over the last few weeks  Brothers Helping Hands has been joining in with the community spirit in COVID-19 relief and support by providing lunches for all care home workers in Blackpool and thus far has provided 400 lunches across TWENTY-SIX homes in the area. We have also donated over 1 100 food items such as fresh salads  coleslaws and pastas to various foodbanks in Blackpool & the Fylde to support the vulnerable  homeless and elderly.    The Initiative has also provided ""Thank You"" drops in to all Emergency Service Stations in Blackpool and Fleetwood  with a further drop planned for Lytham over the next few days.    While we are entirely grateful to a number of organisations; namely the Greencore Group for their regular food donations  Fox's Biscuits for their substantial donations and The Gallant Pioneer for free use of their premises to run the operation from  the current levels of expenditure for accompanying food in the ""Lunches for Carers"" packs is unsustainable for the group.    The Lodge is now launching this fundraising effort to help us to continue our work  to complete our lunches for carers during the COVID-19 pandemic and ringfence funds for further potential relief in the town such as to obtain PPE for free distribution and further support to all those on the front line.    All funds will be used only by the Brothers Helping Hands initiative and if required will be ringfenced for future projects lead by the Brothers Helping Hands initiative.    The Lodge is entirely grateful to all donations no matter how small  and greatly appreciates the support of all those who wish this initiative every success for the benefit of the wider community in Blackpool & the Fylde coast.",False

Bauer media have taken over Rutland Radio and intend to turn it into a greatest hits station with no local information  events or travel news from the 1st September. From this date  you will no longer wake up with Rob Persani  it will be someone presenting from else where in the UK. Rutland and Stamford won’t get a mention. The content will be generic with presenters who’ve never heard of Rutland and Stamford. We need to save our station so we know what’s going on in this very unique part of the world.     Rutland Radio is part of our heritage. It has been here 21 years through blood sweat and tears. It is a labour of love and that’s what has kept it going all these years.  The current presenters do a great job and live in the local area. This means they can easily talk of local issues and events. They are ambassadors for Rutland and Stamford. Rob Persani presents Hero of the Week recognizing the great people in our community. They truly care about our community and are always helping charities such as For Rutland and Mindspace Stamford. Rob Persani cycled 40 miles for Ride & Stride helping to raise £20 000 for our churches’ upkeep. They helped raise awareness for Sonny Ferry from Ketton who tragically lost his life. They promoted the sunshine campaign for a new lifeboat. They really care about the people who live here. They promote the Grainstore’s breakfasts where people old and young can come together and talk about their RAF days. They are TRULY LOCAL with local content.  Rutland Radio is the glue to Oakham  Stamford and Uppingham. It keeps us informed of school closures  of flooding  of accidents. It’s a place to reminisce and feel included. It helps so many people. It promotes the foodbanks so those in need can get access  it promotes the Good and New Clothes Sale  which funds the Citizen’s Advice Bureau in Oakham  it promotes Second Helpings so we reduce our food waste and feed bellies instead  it promotes Mindspace Stamford so we can connect with our fellow human beings through art and reading classes. It supports our businesses encouraging people to shop local with shop Stamford and Oakham  Uppingham and Stamford Markets. They promote us with their Star Awards. They promote local talent including singers and bands such as Chloe Lorentzen from Stamford and The Tin Pigeons from Uppingham every Saturday afternoon. It keeps the elderly company when they feel alone.  The corona virus has been such a difficult time for us all and Rutland Radio have continued to keep us entertained and informed  with presenters working alone from home. Instead of being inundated with negativity about the virus  they have put a positive spin on it with poems from 8 year old Krystal Down from Stamford and chatting to For The Love of Scrubs Stamford  Lincs/Rutland.  So many of us have been isolated during this time and Rutland Radio have been a lifeline  a friend which has kept us going. The money needed will help pay for premises  transmitters  licenses and go towards salaries so we can help them get back on their feet.     How you can help:  1. Donate. It doesn’t have to be a large amount  anything will help.  2. Help me form a team so that I am not doing this alone.   3. Spread the word  by word of mouth or share on FB and Twitter  4.

This number is only increasing.    As many of you may already know  the Covid-19 outbreak had a devastating impact on food banks  leaving many families finding it even harder to feed themselves and their children.     Despite the masses of donations during this time  now that life is slowly going back to some type of normal  it is important not to forget about the families that are still very much in need. In fact  due to Covid-19  even more families are in need due to losses of jobs.     That is why I will be running 5km every day for a week (a total of 35km) to try and raise as much money as I can  to then supply Hull foodbanks with essential items.   Any donation no matter how small will be greatly appreciated.     Thank you!    Lauren Windsor.",False

We have secured approx. £75k from Sport England  £25k from The Steve Morgan Foundation and are looking at other ways to raise money to make this project happen. We may need an additional £20k towards the costs of the building but can't approach either funder for more. We have put in over 18 months worth of bid writing  meetings  reports  council applications  lease issues  blood  sweat and tears  to get us to where we are now. We have worked too hard to fall at this final hurdle. The site is used by 2 organisations. The Inclusion Network CIC provide free youth club activities for local young people  free school holiday youth provision  youth projects  community projects  a foodbank session once a week and European project opportunities for y.p's. They are funded by Children In Need  Henry Smith Foundation and several other smaller funders. This is for 48 weeks of the year. I am Colin Murray  one of the directors of this community interest company  and who is asking for your financial support and backing.  Northfield Football Association run approx. 26 junior football teams from ages 5/6 up to 14/15. They have been set up as a charity since the mid 1990's and have engaged and worked with thousands of young people. It is entirely volunteer led and they have an unbelievable group of people that help run it. Between the 2 organisations we provide approx. 18 000 attendances by young people per year (approx. 25 000 if you count the parents that bring them). Now this is the amazing thing and is the reason why I believe we deserve your support...…..we do all of this work from a small converted football changing room/building!!!!!!!!!!!  We have converted the football changing rooms into a small community centre which comprises of a small meeting/group room  small IT room  a small (falling apart) kitchen  a few toilets and a couple of other storage type rooms. We have the basics like light  electricity  gas etc  but we have no central heating  21st century facilities or no real space to engage even more of the community we care about. That's where you come in. We have been working with the 2 nationally recognised funders mentioned at the start of this story (Sport England and The Steve Morgan Foundation) and have secured 100k of their funding towards this project but we are still falling short of the possible build costs of £120k+. We are hoping this crowdfunding page gets us halfway there!! We are also hoping that all of the people who know us as organisations  and as professionals  can see how close we are to securing a centre that will be fit for purpose  but also know how much work and effort we put into this centre and this community.    Will you please support us and allow us to gain a centre that will still be here in another 25/30 years time serving the local (and further afield) children  young people and adults of our community.",False

Wycombe Food Hub (WFH) came about at the start of lockdown. We collected residual food from leading supermarkets. Our products are often short dated and expired ‘Best Before End’ (BBE) dates. These products are still usable. The range varies on what we source each week from our partners.    During the peak we were collecting over 200 green crates each week and supplying food to partner organisations who were using our produce in 100 meals a week plus 1000 food bags a week    What we do    We supply products to people unable to access or buy food  those that cannot get Government aid or are unable to survive on the Government’s benefit payments  those who are now suffering from loss of jobs and the self-employed who can’t get benefits  those who cannot access the traditional referral foodbanks. Also  Police referrals  refugees  pensioners  YMCA residents  homeless. The range of people coming to us for help is growing weekly. Considering what’s happening nationally the need for our food and services will continue to grow.    Our growth    We secured a small warehouse(room) and opened a market stall under the Guildhall in High Wycombe twice a week for 2 hours. We are now collecting over 300 green crates week and giving out 150 bags of food in 4 hours each week. In addition  supplying food to our partner organisations who are feeding in excess of 300 people a week.    What is next    We have now become a social enterprise CIC to allow us to formalise what we are doing. We have now secured a retail shop in the centre of High Wycombe. The shop will be open a minimum of 3 days a week. We have a warehouse in the store where we can sort and distribute food. This will allow us to both run the shop feeding those in need and also supply our partner organisations who need our fresh produce.     We are now collecting from even more supermarkets  allotments and farms. More outlets are coming online in next few weeks. The shop allows us to distribute not only residual food but also offer chilled and frozen food.     Partner organisations are now working with us and will be taking space in store to signpost and help those needing more care and referral to statutory authorities.    Financial support and sponsorship    Moving into a retail premises has now incurred us some long-term financial liabilities and we need to reach out for help      What we are fundraising for       This includes building  building refurb  building future repairs  liability and building insurance  equipment and software  electricity and utilities  print and collateral . Website and internet/email.      In addition  in order to supplement our residual food collections  we need to purchase extra food and products we don't get from supermarkets. This is purchased from Fareshare and other sources      We started with a zero funding stream. We have managed to secure some small grants and donations from friendly benefactors which has allowed us to deliver to the stage we are now .     We now need to fundraise to be able to grow and continue to deliver services.       If residents and businesses are able to help we would be grateful         To run this service effectively we need town centre warehouse and /retail premises     ",False

We would like to ask you to join us in helping to provide essential food parcels for vulnerable families in Medellin.     Many families are facing serious hardship and do not have the basic necessities due to the current government enforced lockdown.     People are struggling to buy food and have no income.     The current measures here mean that for many people it is impossible to work at the moment. Here there is not a support system in place to help people who cannot work or feed their families  or buy medicine.     We are deeply concerned for the welfare of the families that we work with  the children that we teach English to and the mothers that we spend Wednesday afternoons with in our women’s programme – as well as many other families that at the moment are in a really desperate position.     The lockdown has already lasted a month and the future is uncertain.     Huellas (Footprints)  the foundation we volunteer with are receiving donations and working with the city’s foodbank to deliver food parcels directly those most in need. Huellas have been operating for 10+ years and know the needs of the local area and families (a number of the volunteers live in the area too). They are so dedicated and the team’s response to the crisis has been amazing – finding innovative ways to educate the community to stop the spread of Covid-19 and providing food parcels.     Please help them continue supporting some of the most vulnerable families in the city and we can make sure that the children and mothers we work with  and the wider community  have food. If you have had the chance to visit Colombia  or know Colombians  you will know what warm  generous and kind-hearted people they are  and right now they really need some support.     We know that this is an incredibly difficult and uncertain time for everybody and that lots of people are already supporting charities that they care about. We are so lucky in the UK to have the NHS and a social welfare system that we can use. Many of these families have nothing and for most of us  the difficulties they are facing are unimaginable. You could really make a difference.     All of the money collected goes directly to the foundation who support the families directly by providing basic food supplies. As little as £5 could really help.     Please do donate if you can... and check out our instagram page to see what we have been up to!     https://www.instagram.com/somosfundacionhuellas/",False

Foodbanks  in particular  are being hit very hard during these days of panic buying so I'm looking to raise funds for both the Sunderland East End & Newcastle West End Foodbanks. The story about the Egg  it had been £550 and was on display in Fenwicks Newcastle  made by Charbonnel et Walker  one of Britain’s first and finest chocolatiers. It stands at about 500mm tall and has a circumference of about 1m. It's a mountain of some of the best chocolate in the world. Due to the Covid-19 virus  Fenwicks (a Newcastle institution) had announced it was closing down during this period for the safety of both its staff and customers  as a consequence it was also reducing all of its easter products. So how do I have it and what's the plan?     Having literally called in for something for my dinner that evening  then wondering why the food hall was so busy? I noticed in both the chaos and panic buying the easter products at discounted prices.     I also noticed this mother of all Easter Eggs Big Bertha (one of the biggest Easter Eggs in the Country) and its discounted price. Bargain  but there was no way I could eat it all but could there be a way that we could feed many more from this opportunity and some good news could come from both of these situations... I then cracked open a plan. Make a donation  I have set a minimum donation of £1 but you can donate whatever amount you like. You can make multiple donations to increase your chances or just be a kind person and make one.

That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks  supported by The Trussell Trust  working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.    ABOUT OUR FOODBANK  An introduction to the Morecambe Bay Foodbank project.  Morecambe Bay Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. It began life at the GYM Church on Green Street in Morecambe and has now moved to The West End Community Centre on Westminster Road in Morecambe. We receive and distribute over six tonnes of food each month and our operation has been growing since its inception in 2012.     We have a small staff team led by our Foodbank Manager  Annette Smith  and over eighty regular volunteers who give up their time to help us each week.    ABOUT  HOW FOODBANKS WORK  Providing emergency food to people in crisis.  Every day people in the UK go hungry for reasons ranging from redundancy to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems.    FOOD IS DONATED  Schools  churches  businesses and individuals donate non-perishable  in-date food to a foodbank. Large collections often take place as part of Harvest Festival celebrations and food is also collected at supermarkets.    FOOD IS SORTED AND STORED  Volunteers sort food to check that it’s in date and pack it into boxes ready to be given to people in need. Over 40 000 people give up their time to volunteer at foodbanks.    PROFESSIONALS IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN NEED  Foodbanks partner with a wide range of care professionals such as doctors  health visitors  social workers and police to identify people in crisis and issue them with a foodbank voucher.    CLIENTS RECEIVE FOOD  Foodbank clients bring their voucher to a foodbank centre where it can be redeemed for three days’ emergency food. Volunteers meet clients over a warm drink or free hot meal and are able to signpost people to agencies able to solve the longer-term problem.",False

I'm raising money in aid of Sussex Community Development Association Food Bank and every donation will help. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to me.      The Mayor of Peacehaven  Cllr. Claude Cheta has launched a campaign asking residents to donate either a tin or jar of food which will be delivered to the Seahaven Food Bank.  Cllr. Cheta has picked this charitable organisation to support whilst in post as Mayor.    Peacehaven Town Council are open for donations every weekday morning at Community House  Meridian Centre; however  we understand that the normal way of life has drastically changed over the past three months and it may be difficult to carry out a shopping trip to the supermarket. Bearing this in mind  we have also set up a GoFundMe so you can donate to the Mayor’s appeal without having to leave the house.    Either way it will help this vital cause. The Seahaven Foodbank covers the Havens which includes Peacehaven clients.    Seahaven Foodbank  also known as Newhaven Foodbank  provides food parcels to families and individuals in Newhaven  Sussex  and the surrounding areas.  The falloff in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that the food bank has had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one-week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries.  All donations to the Mayor’s GoFundMe page will go directly to the food bank.

No Judgement. Nobody Should be Hungry.      The Deli Group have launched our Christmas Campaign - www.nobodyshouldbehungry.co.uk - offering FREE Christmas Dinners for those in need across the St Helens and Newton-Le-Willows areas.     We're funding this ourselves as much as we are able to  working in conjunction with many of our key suppliers  however lots of incredibly kind and generous customers  friends and neighbours have asked about contributing so that we can help even more people.    We've always been clear that we're not a charity  and we were reluctant to become involved with handling donations as it's so easy for good intentions to be misconstrued or misinterpreted where money is concerned. Having said that  we realise that there is only so much we can do with our own limited resources and the goodwill of our suppliers  so having taken some advice we've set up this GoFundMe page as a means to transparently collect any contributions which you wonderful people may like to make towards this initiative.    To keep things as transparent and open as possible  we've also opened an entirely separate  ring fenced bank account - and we will regularly share details of any contributions and expenditure both here and via our Dentons Deli and Newton Deli social media accounts.    As we've no idea what the cost of providing these meals will be until all bookings are confirmed  it's difficult to set a budget or to stop accepting contributions once the cost has been met  therefore again to keep things open and to ensure that nobody benefits unfairly from the generosity of others  we've decided to donate any surplus to St Helens Foodbank  and again we will share details of this publicly.    Thank you all so very much for your help and support. By working together  we can make such a difference to the lives of those locally who may otherwise be hungry this Christmas.           Please see below details of the campaign -     For many years we’ve not sent Christmas cards or gifts outside of our immediate family  instead giving a donation either of money or our time to charity  to help those in need.    This year  we’ve decided to try to do our bit in ensuring that nobody living locally has to go hungry. Whatever the reasons  and putting politics and judgement aside  far too many people - both adults and children - are going without the food they need to live  which is totally unacceptable when so many have far more than they need. We may not have a lot ourselves  but what little we have we’d like to share to hopefully make things a little easier for others.    So  The Deli Group are pleased to announce the launch of our “Nobody Should Be Hungry” campaign - www.nobodyshouldbehungry.co.uk    If you’re finding things a struggle  or you know somebody who is  we’d like to invite you to book a FREE Christmas Dinner  which will be freshly prepared and delivered on Monday 23rd December between 4pm and 8pm. All meals will be delivered hot and ready to eat  or can be safely kept and re-heated on Christmas Day.    Book online now at www.nobodyshouldbehungry.co.uk - we’re going to work with our suppliers to provide as many meals as we can  but places will be limited both by availability and the time it will take to prepare and deliver so many meals  therefore please book early to avoid disappointment.    Both adult and child sized portions are available  along with the option to collect from our Newton Deli shop or for the meals to be delivered to you at home.    No Questions  No Judgement. NOBODY should EVER be hungry.    Love from Viv  Marc and all of the Deli Group team. x x",False

As well as running a medical centre  they work with some of the poorest communities to improve health  nutrition and living conditions. Patzún  where I lived has a lot of poverty and now  with the current pandemic  this situation has only worsened. As in the UK  people have been unwell or died from the virus and many people have found themselves unable to work - only in Guatemala there is no furlough scheme  no NHS  no foodbank and no benefits of any kind. If a household has absolutely no food  they are draping a white flag out of their home (or just holding it up in the street if they are homeless) and the village will do what they can to share their food.    Through friends of mine living in Patzún  I have recently been introduced to a widow  named Doña Filipa. She lives in a home made of corrugated iron with her three sons  Alex (17 years)  Edy (14) and Jonatan (11). The elder two boys used to help their mother with living costs by doing whatever work they could – manual work  selling ice-creams and so on. However  a month ago (on 6th May)  the sons were out collecting wood for their mother when they slipped and fell 25 metres down a ravine  resulting in one boy having a serious hip and rib injury and the other boy with broken legs. They are bed-ridden and both urgently need medical attention and operations. However  as there is no NHS in Guatemala  they would need to pay the hospital £2000 for this to take place  which is simply not possible.     We have already managed to raise some of this amount  but I wondered if  by sharing their story here  some of my lovely friends might be willing to contribute a small amount towards helping this family out. The money will be sent to Asociación Vida*  who will oversee any support we can offer this family – ideally enabling the sons to receive all the medical attention they need. Any help would be wonderful. If you want more detail about this  please message me – I just didn’t want to write too much on here. Thank you    *Asociación Vida is a registered charity  partnered by Tearfund UK.       Update: 3rd July 2020    I am so grateful to report that we have already raised over £500 towards this cause. Thank you so much for your generosity. The last few days have been spent taking the boys to the clinic in Patzún for some medical checks - and also to the hospital in Chimaltenango for X-rays and consultations with an orthopaedic specialist. The outcome of this visit is that Edy  the younger of the boys  needs an operation to correct the bones that have started to set in the wrong position since the accident took place two months ago. This operation is going to cost 20 000 Quetzales (about £2 085). The elder boy  Alex  will have an MRI scan on his back tomorrow (4th July) and from there a decision will be made about the treatment required. If you are in a position to give anything... we'd be so grateful. If you are not in a position to give financially  we would so value your prayers for these boys. Thank you so much xx      Update: 16th July    Thank you so much for your all your donations. We have all been blown away by your generosity :o)    We are still awaiting an appointment with the neuro specialist (re-scheduled for this Friday) to discuss the findings from Alex’s MRI scan. It is feared he may have serious spinal injuries  which could lead to paralysis. However  due to the COVID 19 outbreak  travelling to the capital for these appointments  amidst the government restrictions  is not proving to be easy at all.    If you are the praying type  please pray that nothing prevents this appointment with the specialist from taking place this Friday. Give thanks for all the money that has been donated and pray that it will be sufficient for both boys to receive the operations and treatment they need.    Thank you so much!      Update: 25th July    Thank you so much to everyone who has donated to this cause. Your generosity has been overwhelming.    Since my last update  the pandemic in Guatemala has worsened as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increase daily alongside the number of deaths caused by the virus. The Government’s very strict lockdown measures have also made it difficult for the boys to be taken to their hospital appointments in the capital  with police issuing fines to people who travel even for medical purposes. Nevertheless  both boys have finally received the results from their X-rays and MRI scans  which were able to take place thanks to your donations. Alex requires the most urgent surgery  as his spinal injuries could easily lead to paralysis. We await news from the hospital about when this can take place. Unfortunately  the Roosevelt hospital  where the procedure will happen  is rampant with COVID-19  with many members of staff and patients having died from the virus. This is obviously of great concern to the family  who  therefore remain somewhat nervous about their upcoming treatment.    If you are the praying type  please pray that the operations will take place soon – and for protection  healing and restoration for the whole family. Amazingly  we should have some surplus money from your donations  so Asociación Vida are making plans to offer further support to this family as well as to others who are also in great need. Please pray for wisdom for them as they seek to best meet the needs of their community at this very pressing time.    Matiox Chawe!

There are only a handful of surgeons in the world who specialise in this field  with the only one in Europe based in Barcelona. This surgeon has diagnosed me remotely through taking a detailed clinical history and studying images from an upright MRI. Below  there is more information about what these conditions are and what they mean for me. The next step for me would be to follow the strong recommendations of the neurosurgeon and meet with him for a series of tests alongside a face-to-face consultation to determine the extent of the issue and how necessary/beneficial surgery would be. These tests are as follows: Cineradiology - Similar to a digital motion x-ray  this imaging is used to confirm the extent of instability in the spine. It is simply an x-ray in motion in flexion and extension of the spine. This is perhaps the most important test as the neurosurgeon suspects from my upright MRI that I have subaxial instability from C2-C4. Knowing the extent of my subaxial instability is important as it directly impacts treatment options  and this test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. MRV - The MRV is a angio/venogram (with contrast) of the brain and neck looking for possible stenosis or compression of any of the veins or arteries (especially the jugular veins). This is important as vascular stenosis can be a comorbidity or consequence of CCI and AAI  which I have been diagnosed with. If I have any compression  it may be able to be treated by a specialist here in the UK  which could alleviate symptoms - so it is important to know if I have it. Ophthalmologic exam - Similarly  the ophthalmologic evaluation checks for signs of papilledema or damage to the optical nerve from intracranial hypertension. Again  intracranial hypertension can be treated in the UK so this knowledge would be immensely useful for tackling my health moving forward. The results of these tests  and my original imaging and questionnaires would then be discussed in a face-to-face appointment. So far  I have been diagnosed by the neurosurgeon solely on the measurements of my MRI combined with my clinical history. A face-to-face appointment is important to confirm these diagnoses  discuss surgery and whether it is necessary  and ask any questions I might have. To this end  I am planning a trip to Barcelona in April and I have outlined a breakdown of the costs of the trip below: Cineradiology - €350 MRV - €700 Ophthalmologic exam - €220 Consultation - € 250 Total costs of tests and appointment - €1520  or approximately £1300. Additionally  we are also asking to partially crowdfund some of the costs of accommodation. The final accommodation isn’t booked yet but the cost is approximately £200 a night  with four nights total. Total costs of accommodation = £800 This means that we are asking for £2100 in total  with myself and my family paying for the remainder  including flights  the rest of the accommodation  transport  travel insurance  food  etc. Background information In 2011 I developed Myalgic Encephalomyelitis  a multi-systemic but primarily neuro-immune disease which has absolutely devastated my life. My health has declined a lot over the years; I had to give up schooling  became a wheelchair user in 2015  am unable to work  and now find myself bedbound/housebound a lot of the time. The symptoms are numerous and debilitating. I am in severe pain daily  my cognition is profoundly impacted  my muscles are significantly weakened  and my gastro-intestinal system is affected. I have developed co-morbid conditions  including a yet to be diagnosed heart condition. This is just a fraction of what I face. The crowdfunding campaign I did in 2015 to get my wheelchair absolutely changed my life for the better  and I would argue saved my life  given that I haven’t attempted suicide since I’ve had my wheelchair. I was able to take up archery  start several voluntary jobs which contribute a lot to society  become a lot more independent on a daily basis  travel the world  and save myself a lot of pain and speed of decline. However  my condition has still deteriorated  albeit a lot slower than it would have without my lifesaving wheelchair. For many years I had resigned myself to the fact that my disease is incurable  and in my case  progressive. However  in 2019 it progressed to be the worst it’s ever been and I lost a large amount of the little functionality I had left. This has left me in a dire place mentally  and at high risk of suicide. I started to do a lot more research into potential treatments and causes  most of which I had given up on years ago because of the prohibitive costs. I found that a small but growing subset of ME patients are finding that they have structural issues that cause symptoms similar to or the same as their ME symptoms. In October 2019 I found out that I am part of that subset  having both CCI and AAI as well as suspected subaxial instability. CCI in its most basic sense means that my head isn’t being properly supported by my neck  causing brainstem irritation and possible compression. As the brainstem is a vital component of a lot of bodily functions  this causes a whole host of symptoms  including tachycardia  heat intolerance  polydipsia  chronic fatigue  neck pain  facial pain  muscle weakness  dizziness and vertigo  and many others. AAI means that when I turn my head left or right  two of the uppermost vertebrae in my spine  the atlas and axis  are subluxing  which means a partial dislocation. As you can imagine  this causes many symptoms too. Whether the CCI is a cause or effect of my ME is unknown. It could be that the CCI is causing all of my ME symptoms  as in the case of Jen Brea and Jeffrey Wood (see below)  or it could be that the inflammation and tissue degradation that is part of my ME has caused the structural issues I am now facing due to my ligaments weakening. However  either way it needs to be addressed  and treating it could potentially improve some of my symptoms and give me more of a life. In order to treat it  we first need to know the extent of the problem  hence the testing. My life as is stands feels very unliveable. I am currently unable to partake in most of my voluntary jobs. I have had to give up archery  which was the sport I took up after having to give up cheerleading. I am slowly but surely losing everything that makes my life feel worthwhile. If I can regain at least some of my health  even to the level I was three years ago (still disabled)  that would be lifechanging  and saving. I am doing everything I can to make this happen  including private treatment for my ME in the UK. The CCI testing is a large and crucial part of the jigsaw. Unfortunately  none of this is available on the NHS. While the NICE guidelines are still under review  they currently promote CBT and GET as ‘treatments’ for ME  despite every ME expert in the world explicitly stating that this is harmful. I credit GET for the decline in my health that led to me becoming a wheelchair user. CBT is not an appropriate treatment for a neurological disease  though psychological support is crucial in dealing with such a devastating illness. I am receiving this mental health support on the NHS which I am immensely thankful for. Any treatment to address the underlying disease process and its effects (perhaps including the CCI) has to be done privately. I have briefly outlined below why I need help with this. If you would like to read more about CCI  please follow the links below: https://www.me-pedia.org/wiki/Craniocervical_instabilityhttps://centenoschultz.com/craniocervical-instability/https://medium.com/@jenbrea/health-update-3-my-me-is-in-remission-dd575e650f71 https://www.mechanicalbasis.org/ Why I need to crowdfund Due to the severity of my conditions I am unable to work and therefore my only income is disability benefits. A significant chunk of this contributes to my social care package which I use to employ a PA  and further money goes on monthly medical costs. So far I have been funding these investigations through money left to me by my Grandfather when he died  but this money is dwindling rapidly as I have spent a substantial amount of money on the Upright MRI and consultations alone. I need the rest for treatments in the UK  the cost of which is enormous. How your donation will help Any amount donated will help me get the testing I need to determine the extent of my CCI and AAI  which is the first step before I can undertake any treatments for it. Future treatments (which I will likely also have to crowdfund for) could give me my life back. What does that look like? It means me no longer being intensely suicidal every day. It means me being able to go back to my roles as a voluntary support worker for survivors of sexual violence; supporting some of the most vulnerable members of society at a local foodbank; and continuing my work as a local parish councillor.

(Meet the Um family  the first two candidates  Wataia standing in the middle in white  and Srey Vit standing next to me in black on the right)    My name is Jobi. I have been working in rural Cambodia since March 2017  first as a volunteer teaching English at a charity based in Takeo province  then as it General Manager  which included running it's education and community outreach through its Foodbank Project and other initiatives.     Now let me tell you about the Um family. They are very poor. Wataia is the young man in the white shirt and is 21. He had to start school late as the family couldn't afford to send him when he was younger. He is extremely humble and works tirelessly to provide for his family.    The young woman in black is Srey Vit  his younger sister who is 19. She managed to start school at the right age and that's why they have both finished high school at the same time  despite the 2 year age difference. She is very sweet  cares deeply for her parents  working very hard juggling studying  working on their farm and looking after their mother.    Both of them spend most of their free time helping make ends meet at the family home. They both love to study though and have a good record at school. Wataia dreams of working in a bank and Srey Vit would love to be an accountant as they are both very good at maths. They want nothing more than to go to university so they can get better jobs and help their family.    Their mother had stop working recently due to illness. She used to sell food and snacks before but even then the family struggled. Now the family is reliant upon the father  who is a labourer  but work is extremely sporadic and the auntie selling homegrown vegetable for $125 a month. At best  they make $275 a month. This is for a family of 5. Their is nothing left after paying expenses  especially as the mother is sick and needs lots of medical care.    Currently there is no way for them to attain their dream of going to uni. Their courses cost $600 each a year over 3 years. For a family of 5 that can barely get by $3300  $1200 a year plus all the other costs such as books and supplies is impossible to afford.     One thing that is striking is the high cost of higher education  with no government grant or loan system in place. It is a significant barrier to entry  and only middle class families can easily afford it; the poorer families have no way to access even if the student is very bright as only a tiny number can obtain scholarships.    Let me break it down:  University fees range from $450 to $650 per year depending on the course at the local university in Takeo. The costs to study at more prestigious university in Phnom are astronomically higher.     Most lower level salaries range from $80 to $200 a month. This includes working at one of the many textile factories  real 'sweatshops'  which are terribly regulated and unsafe. Often families are little more than subsistence farmers making little more than the bare minimum to survive  making far less money than those on salaries and their income is very unpredictable thanks to the increasingly varied weather during growing season thanks to Climate Change.    Virtually all higher paid jobs that are legal require a university degree as standard. If families cannot afford to have their kids go to university  the cycle of poverty for them is almost unbreakable in rural areas  even if the kids are extremely talented.     $1800 for a three year course is simply too high for the poorest to afford. They will likely earn enough to barely survive for the rest of their lives. However this is not the case  if their is outside intervention. This is what I'm asking you to be apart of. This fund will start providing talented but poor young women and men a means to go to university  break the cycle of poverty and improve the quality of life for themselves  their families and their communities. We intend to pay for their university fees either in full or partly depending on how much we raise.    We will pay the fees directly to the university ourselves. Each candidate will be vetted thoroughly and only chosen if they are deemed suitable. Everything will be invoiced and accounted for.    For Wataia and Srey Vit  if we can afford to pay at least half of their uni fees per semester of $600  they may have a shot at going. Even then they will have to make tough sacrifices. If we can raise enough to pay in full  it will be far easier for them  though still with many difficulties. Anything extra will go towards school supplies for them; textbooks are very expensive and a laptop to share would be necessary at some point for their course. Anything raised more than our target will go towards the next candidate for this fund.    This is one of the best ways to really change two lives in an incredibly positive way.     Thank you for taking the time to read this. I know it is a long read but I wanted to be as clear as possible. We have about a month to raise the funds.    Anything you could give would be greatly appreciated. Thank you and please feel free to get in touch.    Jobi",False

Lives destroyed  false imprisonment  bankruptcy & suicide. We have until July 15th to raise the funds needed so time is running out.    The Post Office Horizon scandal. The Post Office which is a government and public owned company has been proven in the High Court to be hiding information regarding the robustness of its IT equipment  treating its staff in 'capricious  arbitrary ways which would not be unfamiliar to a mid-Victorian factory Owner and then seeking to cover it up either with government help or through total incompetence. The government had a duty to get it resolved as mentioned in National Audit Office and Internal Cross Party government documents regarding ‘Arms length businesses’ controlled by government for which Post Office is one of them.    There are over 550 claimants who completed costly litigation  with around the same amount waiting in the wings (and probably a lot more). Lives were destroyed  businesses lost  homes repossessed  bankruptcies  false imprisonment  families destroyed  health issues and suicides  all down to a total cover up of the truth. It has since been revealed there are over 1 500 further cases.    I was one of these claimants and due to lack of government intervention for which they were responsible for doing we had to find third party funding to bring this to a head. This means under UK law the cost of funding cannot be recovered from the Post Office and it is estimated claimants will not even recover a tiny fraction of losses incurred. Those who made the decisions including directors  management and the chairman remain running this business. The EX CEO Paula Vennells who decided to resign days before the first substantial judgement was released by the High Court has since been awarded a CBE  a position in the cabinet office of government and also chairs one of the largest NHS Groups (Imperial NHS). The support of MP's is growing in recent weeks across both sides of the house.    We need an inquiry to ensure ALL those responsible are held to account and all those who suffered are compensated for losses that they had no control over due to a failing IT system   draconian unfair contracts and horrific actions by Post Office Ltd.    The Post Office continued to fight the litigation even though days before they responded to the claimants pre-court action letter they held a board meeting where they approved a document that stated their Horizon IT system was 'not fit for purpose'. They then proceeded to spend over 50 million pounds of taxpayer cash telling the court Horizon was definitely robust  this alone proves they were willing to cover up the truth. Here is an extract of the judgement handed down on the 16th December 2019 :-    “The IT Strategy  which is referred to in this Update Decision Paper  and outlined that “the IT [Horizon] was not fit for purpose” and which was approved in July 2016 by the Post Office Board is  in my judgment  entirely consistent with my conclusions on the evidence. It is not  however  consistent with the Post Office’s response to the claimants’ pre-action letter  or the Defence in the group litigation  or the evidence adduced by the Post Office in the Horizon Issues trial. The Post Office’s solicitors’ response to the pre-action letter is dated 28 July 2016  very lengthy  and states that “the investigations to date have consistently pointed towards human error or dishonest conduct in branches as the most likely cause of shortfalls.” [H 954]    All this was a complete lie and they were willing to allow Postmasters to lose their livelihoods  their families  some their dignity and others their lives whilst at the same time blowing through millions in taxpayer cash to do so.    We are calling on this government to start a full Judicial Inquiry led by Fraser Justice.    Your pledge will help us take our complaint to the Parliamentary Ombudsman for maladministration in the government departments (BEIS - Department for Business  Energy and Industrial Strategy) and the relevant ministers so those who have suffered enormously over a 20 year period can get the answers  accountability and justice they rightly deserve and finally move on with their lives. It will not bring back those who have sadly taken their lives but it will allow the family members left behind to have closure and justice.    I can tell you on behalf of all those affected who have waited 2 decades to clear their names will be eternally grateful for all contributions.

Learn more about S2 Foodbank here    This became even more poignant this weekend when Pat Midgley  mother of my good friend Neil  S2 Councillor and former mayor of Sheffield  passed away due to Coronavirus. As an S2 native she was a staunch supporter and helper at S2 Foodbank  demonstrating the outstanding social conscience that runs through the family.     All I ask is that you think of about how much would you have spent on a few drinks had you been out this payday weekend? You might even have bought me a birthday drink? Instead  please donate what you can to help.    Thanks x",False

We are raising money in aid of The Trussell Trust and every donation will help. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to me.    The Coronavirus pandemic is having massive effects on all our families and communities. Many people have lost their jobs whilst others are in a period of uncertainty. It is horrible worrying about how you will manage to feed yourself and your family. However  food banks can distribute much needed amenities throughout the community reaching those that need a bit of extra support. I have seen first hand what great work food banks do within their local communities.    Every donation they receive makes a real difference and they will be so grateful for your generosity in this time of uncertainty. By donating to the Trussell Trust  you’re enabling them to continue supporting food banks across the country and working towards a future where food banks are no longer needed.     Thank you!

I’ve seen that people are donating to raise £500 000 to make Big Ben ‘bong’ at 11pm on 31st January. Apparently that is an important time for a good bonging. Thinking about it  I’m prepared to bong at this time for way less money. In fact I’d probably do it for free.    Since people are willing to pay for a big bong though  I figured I might as well take advantage of that and raise some moneyfor a good cause. I’ll probably look a bit silly but even if I raise £50 for it  then it’ll have been worth it! NOTE: This is not political in any way  just a daft way to raise money for a cause I really care about.   The Trussell Trust do fantastic work trying to combat hunger in the UK  including running a pretty hefty network of food banks.

I'm Jen  a comic book creator based in Leeds!

We have a new family member! Meet Petie:      Petie was taken in by the amazing people over at Dogs Trust Leeds after he had been repeatedly attacked in his previous home. He is a senior dog who just needed a stable and safe retirement home  and we were more than happy to help!    Going through the process of adopting Petie really opened my eyes to the exceptional work that goes on behind the scenes at Dogs Trust. I decided pretty quickly that I wanted to give back to them somehow in the near future.    So this 10 hour art stream will be a bit different than my previous two!    I will need to take a break to go for a walk with Petie  so the stream will briefly go offline for that  but I'll make up for that time by streaming a bit later! Whatever money is raised will be split evenly and donated to Trussell Trust foodbank Leeds and Dogs Trust!     If you have a few pounds spare  please consider helping us out!   And join our art stream on the 24th of October from 8am (UK Time) at https://www.twitch.tv/jeninator !     Thank you for taking the time to read this and have a lovely day <3 ",True

I can in some small way understand the fear and worry people would face without this resource. As someone often in the church building  I see first-hand people (often not the ones we 'picture' in our minds)  but everyday hard-working families  people like us  who just need a helping hand. SO I went to Tesco to buy some food for us hoping to donate some too. But there was no food to give so I thought I could give my donation in financial terms - thus allowing Yeovil Christian Support Trust to top up their own surplus and use my gift as they require. Perhaps you would consider doing the same. Could you spare a fiver to help top up the food bank and other groups the Lords larder helps.

The Sefton 4 Good Campaign has been created by Sefton Council and Sefton CVS in response to the worldwide spread of COVID-19. The fundraising campaign will support a range of local voluntary  community and faith sector organisations who are working tirelessly to help vulnerable residents across the borough.    As a key organisation of the Sefton Borough  we at Hugh Baird College believe we can assist in the fundraising effort by calling on the kindness and generosity of our students  staff  alumni  the local community and other organisations the College works closely with.    Funds raised for this campaign will be accepted through this Go Fund Me page. Go Fund Me is a well known  trusted and established organisation that has helped to raise millions for worthwhile causes.    Periodically  the College will pledge their fundraising total to the Sefton 4 Good fund.    These funds will then be used by Sefton Council and Sefton CVS in the areas where funds are most needed – such as our local foodbanks across Sefton who are continuing to provide vital support  as well as other groups providing befriending services and reducing social isolation and anxiety.    https://sefton4good.org.uk/2020/03/25/appeal-donate-to-sefton-4-good-support-vital-initiatives-in-response-to-the-covid-19-outbreak/    All funds will be distributed to frontline voluntary  community and faith sector initiatives providing practical support and essential services to Sefton residents.",False

Following the forced closure of our nursery business during the COVID 19 lockdown  we began experiencing firsthand the impact to many families with Children when it came to food preparation. Initially we developed single portion healthy pots of food to be microwaved at home to give some practical help to families. After running a survey of our parents  it became very evident that this product would help all families in the exact same position  but with less financial resource. At this point we began donating 1 pot for every 10 pots we sell to a family in need.

""When I was a child like many growing up  I suffered from a lack of confidence and belief within myself  at the time and even to this day I was amazed and overwhelmed by HOW BIG and SCARY this world could be to a child raised in a single-parent household. I was told never to expect too much from myself. But my mother imparted me with a very important life lesson that I now follow to this day and that is  ""In order to be a leader you must first learn to love and lead yourself.""    I know now  that time has come  for me now and this is my announcement to the rest of the world  that I'm ready to lead this world into a new era of posperity and unity. A world where we are connected through our pride and success of how far we've come together  instead of a world hindered by our differences.    WHY I NEED YOUR HELP ?    I want to use my experience   talents and skillsets to empower young and old black people from across the world through global development and green technology.    I will help fulfil and unkept legacy and help the people of Africa and the Carribean  to realise the potential within them.    HOW WOULD I ACCOMPLISH THIS ?    Providing a continental high class quality education system that is free for all of its citizens.    Utilise Green technology to begin to address the solutions that can be made for ensuring a future for all the world and its inhabitants.    Providing free electricity and access to the internet for all nations in Africa and the Carribbean.    A continent united under one constitution.    A country where our resources and talents are not exploited and abused by corporations that do not hold the interests of the people or its land.    A nation where poverty  war and social-economic exploitation is a thing of the past.    A continental foodbank that can address hunger and be used in cases of national disaster and emergency.    A continent that supports the art of learning  intergrity and the pursuit of truth just as much as its academia.    A nation that can be called HOME for its citzens and descendants all over the world.    A continent that loves its people and doesn't suffer from the actions of leaders that abuse their power.    To create solutions for major diseases affecting African lives  including malaria and HIV/AIDS.    This is the grand vision that I have for the people that I care so much about  but in order to do that I first need your help ! Regardless of whether its through financial help  wisdom or networking  I have a vision to create a better world that isn't just about myself or what I can gain out of this  that's why any advice and support is just as greatly appreciatied.    WHY AM I DOING THIS ?    I want to create a world where we stop protesting about being shot  killed or mistreated and can begin to celebrate the evolution of how powerful we truly are and how far we've come. I know I am not the first to have thought of all these ideals but I know I will be the first to deliver them for the benefit of others.      I would like to thank anyone that has read this far  and I wish nothing but the best for you and your loved ones. I am only one mind  but I would appreciate any exchange of thoughts and ideas to build a better world.

The money raised will be split evenly between two very worthy causes at this time;    THE BLACK CURRICULUM    ‘The Black Curriculum is a social enterprise founded in 2019 by young people to address the lack of Black British history in the UK Curriculum. We believe that by delivering arts focused Black history programmes  providing teacher training and campaigning through mobilising young people  we can facilitate social change.’    THE TRUSSELL TRUST FOOD BANK NETWORK    ‘We don’t think anyone in our community should have to face going hungry. That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks  supported by The Trussell Trust  working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.‘    I’d like to think that even if we raised £50 we have done it for good reason and tried to support these causes in any way we can when we’re on lockdown!     It would give us happy little hearts if you could donate and share. ",False

Back before all this madness started I sillily signed myself up to do my first ever half marathon  the Hackney Half on the 17th May  SO when coming into lockdown I decided that although this event was likely to be cancelled  I would still like to try and push myself to run the distance on the original date and hopefully raise a bit of money for a worthwhile charity that needs support more than ever.     I am not a runner and it has been a painful slog trying to motivate and keep training. In less than 2 weeks I'm going to attempt the 21K that I would have been running in Hackney and hope that the cheering from my family will be enough to get me round the course as opposed to the huge crowds that would have been at the real event!     I'd like to raise some money in aid of The Trussell Trust an amazing charity that supports UK food banks and every donation will help. At the moment 81% more emergency food parcels being given out across the UK  including 122% more parcels going to children compared to this time last year.    I know so many people have used food as a means to brighten up their quarantine so I think it is so important that this is shared to those who are struggling to feed their families and even put one meal on their table a day. Anything you can donate would be hugely appreciated and will hopefully help keep a family fed throughout these uncertain times.     I'll be posting the death of my running career on the 17th and knowing that we've been able to support others in need will hopefully help me get round the distance!!

My life has been privileged and compared to most  easy. So instead of getting drunk on cheap wine and eating cake  I will play video games for 12 hours & raise money for two foundations that are near to my heart.     First up - Stand Against Racism & Inequality. For those who are unaware  my half-brother is black. We were adopted when we were younger  and out of our many siblings  the majority of them are black. Living in a small Illinois town they were an oddity  and racism did exist. Not a day goes by where my family & I do not worry about each other  but we worry more about the ones who can be murdered for just being black in a white world.     50% of the donations that are raised over the course of the fundraiser will be donated to Stand up Against Racism & Inequality.     You can learn more about the charity by visiting their website: https://www.sariweb.org.uk/who-we-are/about-sari/      This is not a Black Lives Matter only organization  but helps with all racism  bigotry  and sexism. But their focus is helping victims of hate crimes  and with those on the rise in the UK we can all agree that its a good cause.       The second foundation is Paddington Partnership: https://www.thisispaddington.com/paddington-partnership/about-us    They work with businesses in the Paddington area to raise money  donate their time and help out at some of the less fortunate areas of Paddington. This is interesting because our Building we work in is about 50 Million  but if I cross the street and walk 3 minutes  there's a crap block of flats full of people struggling. Paddington Partnership takes the privileged workers in these fancy offices & pairs them with programs and events to help those in need.     My team at work read with the students of King Solomon Academy every week  and have for nearly 3 years now. I personally run a monthly bookclub at the Marlybone Woman's shelter where we're currently reading David Sedaris.    On top of that  every year 3-4 groups get together to help in the community in various ways.

The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed many families into poverty as the disruption to the economy has left millions of people newly unemployed or furloughed.    Food banks have seen a massive rise in demand as many people are struggling to afford food. However  it has been difficult for food banks to get the supplies they need. Donations have slowed down as people have stockpiled items to see themselves through the pandemic.     Our food bank is situated at Middlesex University in Hendon  London. It usually runs on donations but as the number of our beneficiaries grow we urgently need funds to continue running this important service. Your donation would go towards buying food and supporting the daily operational costs of this crucial resource.     A donation of any size would be greatly appreciated. If you cannot afford to donate  you can help us by spreading the word about our cause.    About Us    The Nations Africa centre (‘NAC’) is a Registered UK Charity that supports the Algerian community within the UK and promotes social cohesion by bringing the traditions and diverse culture of Algeria to the wider public. We provide services such as immigration advice  shelter referrals  and job skills training as well as holding social events like community dinners.    We have established a number of projects during this crisis  including providing a mental health helpline and delivering free food parcels to vulnerable people. We have worked to provide NHS staff with food and 3D-print face masks for those of them on the front lines.    Charity no.1157212",False

When we hear the word ‘poverty’ we often think of children in third world countries who have absolutely nothing and although these children are suffering and need our help too  we also have millions of people on our doorstep using foodbanks every day to feed their families. The wage gap in our country is ever growing under our current government and until we can make big changes to stop it once and for all- we must do what we can to individually help those around us. I used to work as a door-to-door charity fundraiser and often found that the most generous people were those with virtually nothing. They always wanted to sign up and do what they could to help as they knew what it was like to struggle that much. These people have inspired me for years and now I want to do something to help give back. So this is why I have decided to do a sponsored fast to help raise funds for a foodbank Initiative in my favourite place in the UK- Hackney!

Follow along on Instagram @indiabach    I had these two weeks booked off work to go on a romantic history tour of Italy with my husband it's something we do every year and we always look forward to it  we were starting in Venice and making our way to Naples over the two weeks.     As you can imagine that hasn't gone to plan and as I work in a shop rather than having my two weeks off I've found myself like all of us in lock down for atleast three weeks.     Struggling to find food on empty shelves and having the luxury of being able to grab the last that was left whilst making small essentials trips I couldn't help but think how terrifying this time must be for those who were already struggling to buy food. Now with children off school the pressure must be unbelievable.     I personally suffer with at times intense anxiety and depression so recently purchased an indoor exercise bike which during these times has been a live saver.     Challenging myself to add an extra kilometer each day to my morning cycle it suddenly hit me that in 6 days I had hit 76 kilometres and thought to myself this morning  ""what if I could ride the length of venice to naples."" that combined with feeling utterly useless in the fight again this virus  whilst so many are working day and night to help. I decided I would start a donation page to go along with my personal little cycle challenge. If the only person who donates is me then I really don't mind but I would be so grateful if you could spare even a £1 to go towards this amazing charity!!     So here it is 76 kilometres down  649 to go!       This is very thrown together last minute so bare with me but to be honest what hasn't been thrown together last minute recently!!

It is during this unprecedented time that we need to come together and do our share to help those impacted the most. We (Vik Mohith  Phil Tucker  Michael Brouder  Robert Palmer and Brian Macy) have decided to start this fundraising scheme on behalf of The Trussell Trust. As a result of the pandemic  families with little or no income  are falling behind and are struggling to provide themselves with the basics such as food. The Trussell Trust support a nationwide network of food banks and provide emergency food to those in need. Foodbank use has shown a steady increase over the last few years (Between April 2018 and March 2019  food banks in the Trussell Trust network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis  a 19% increase on the previous year) – the current pandemic will most likely increase the demand for these invaluable resources. We've come up with the idea of using a nomination system where we start with nominating 4 or more friends or colleagues to donate however much can be spared to the Trussell Trust. The nominees will each hopefully donate and/or nominate another 4 or more friends or colleagues who then do the same. This ripple effect will hopefully help us reach our goal. We absolutely appreciate that a donation may not be possible for everyone  but nominations will help spread the message of the good work the Trussell Trust do to those who may be able to help in a material way. Donations of food and essential non-food items such as toiletries and hygiene products can also be made at collection points in supermarkets across the country. We hope that you will join us on this journey in achieving this goal – together we can make a difference! Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to us.

Our best friend Alice and her partner Adam moved to Sri Lanka to work for a year back in 2018. Not long after arriving  Adam found a tiny kitten in the bushes where they were living and her mum was nowhere to be found. Alice and Adam took little Mo in and they enjoyed the rest of their year together.    When it was time for Alice and Adam to leave  they had always planned to wait until they were settled in their next home and have Mo brought over to them  wherever they were. For a number of reasons  Alice and Adam were both back in the UK as the Coronavirus pandemic was taking hold. Because of the pandemic  unfortunately Alice was made redundant from her job in travel and Adam has also found himself out of work. Despite both being unemployed  they have given up so much of their time to volunteer throughout the pandemic  managing their local mutual aid group and more recently helping out at a foodbank.    After a tough few months  Alice and Adam were ready to bring Mo over from Sri Lanka. They completed all the paperwork as required and arranged the logistics from the Sri Lankan end with the necessary contacts and organisations. On 3rd August  Mo started her long journey to her new home.    However  on arrival  it was found that the person sending Mo had not completed all the required paperwork which would have allowed Alice and Adam to take Mo home straight away.    Alice and Adam  who hadn't seen Mo for almost a year  were dealt a huge blow - Mo would have to be quarantined for four months. They would also have to pay a fine of £3400 for the error  which was not their fault  in addition to paying to put Mo in a cattery for the duration of her four-month quarantine. Their contact in Sri Lanka has refused to take any responsibility and pay the fine and is now ignoring their messages and emails.    Alice and Adam are devastated and we are devastated for them  and poor Mo. They have always worked so hard but have fallen on tough times as a result of the pandemic  as many others have. Living in London with no income and a huge fine to pay for a mistake they didn't make is causing our friends a huge amount of stress. A cuddle with Mo would make things a whole lot better  but they have a while to wait until she is home with them.    They would never ask for help like this but we wanted to do something for Alice and Adam who are always so willing do whatever they can for others. We know times are tough for so many people  but if you can  please help our friends to get little Mo home.",False

More information about Hestia Housing and Support: We support people in crisis including victims of modern slavery  women and children who have experienced domestic abuse  young care leavers and older people. From giving someone a home  to helping them to get the right mental health support  we support people at the moment of crisis and enable them to build a life beyond a crisis. We are supported by more than 460 volunteers across London who provide specialist skills such as art therapy  yoga  IT  gardening & cooking  as well as befriending & fundraising.    Lockdown has been challenging for everyone  but for those living with profound trauma  coronavirus has heightened fears and prolonged recovery. Children in Hestia’s refuges have been isolated from friends  school and any sense of normality after escaping abusive households. Unable to run around and play  they have been confined to their bedrooms for their safety. We fear this could result in a long-term impact on their mental health and education.     How you can help    That is why Hestia is launching the Summer Wellbeing Programme (a change on their usual Summer Play Scheme). We know these families will continue to need specialist support with their recovery through therapeutic support along with other essential items over the summer holidays such as activities and games.     Every donation made during Big Give will be doubled and go directly to Summer Wellbeing Programme to help these families build a life beyond crisis.     Blerta’s story (as told by Alex her advocate)    Blerta* is a survivor of modern slavery and has two young children. She relies on emergency food parcels from Hestia and foodbanks to support her family.     Blerta and her family live in shared accommodation with other asylum seekers. This has been increasingly difficult as one of her daughters struggles with health issues meaning they have been unable to leave the house. The family are feeling really isolated and low as they need to stay in their room. Blerta will wait for the other residents to leave the kitchen before she deep cleans and then prepares food for her family so she is not having any social contact with anyone else.    Berta’s favourite reflection from last summer is the trip to the zoo she was able to go on with her daughters through Hestia’s summer programme  it was the highlight of their summer. Her children were able to return to school in September with a story of their summer to share with the class. The summer programme not only funded the trip to the zoo but also enabled each family to take a keepsake family photo of the day home with them which Blerta explained to her case worker it was the first family photo they had ever had and she was so thankful for Hestia arranging this trip.",True

So far we have supplied hundreds of registered charities in the UK with hygiene parcels including Foodbanks  homeless shelters  refugees  NHS Trusts  Youth Centres  Community Trusts and refugee organisations.       We send the products most of us take for granted and can't imagine living our daily existence without like shampoo  deodorant  shower gel  soap  toothpaste and disposable razors. The products that make us clean and able to face the world. Not luxuries but essentials for our general health our mental health and our wellbeing.       So far - as we wait for our official charity status to be confirmed - Beauty Banks has been 100% self-funded. We've managed to reach thousands of people across the UK because of the incredible goodwill  kindness and generosity of our amazing supporters. We are and will remain homemade and grassroots because we want the few pennies we do raise and spend to go towards donations and delivery costs.       WE NEED YOUR HELP PLEASE.    The summer holidays are putting a massive strain on our charity partners as this is the worst time of year for Britain's poorest children. Official figures report that 3 million children who rely on the school not only for education but also for social engagement (friend-time)  pastoral care and a square meal the holidays are a hellish and lonely time. So they rely on our charity partners to support them and help them survive the summer.     For Beauty Banks this means we are overrun with requests for support and donations. We are fortunate that our amazing supporters continue to help us do what we do by generously sending us products week after week. The help we need at the moment is some funding to cover the costs of getting donations where they need to go. So if you can help by sparing a few pounds we would be SO GRATEFUL.     No donation is too small but it will make a big difference to us and the people we serve.     THANK YOU Love Jo & Sali",False

As a result of the partnerships which have been made we have been able to supply food parcels for up to 100 families a week at times  this does not account for the number of people who come to collect food items at the church and these are separate to the Foodbank referrals. The contacts for the food parcels have come through various schools  individuals and other groups. We have also arranged the purchase and packing of around 50 fresh fruit and vegetable parcels for the local food bank each week. Since the start of Covid we have produced over 1250 food parcels between the Wokingham Community Hub  the Foodbank and direct contacts.    The majority of the items we have are donated however with the financial donations we receive we are able to put this back into the project and purchase items that we require. Share- Wokingham has been open daily to anyone who can come along to Norreys Church  offering bakery items and any other surplus food stock we have – there is no charge for this but if people are able to make a donation  however small  it is always appreciated. This means it does not carry the stigma attached to going to the Foodbank as people are not just being able to feed themselves for little to no money but they are also having an environmental impact in tackling the waste issue.    As the pandemic has continued the needs of those that we support have changed  initially it was people who were shielding and unable to get out and now we are really seeing the economic impact  job losses and financial woes have meant that people are struggling - that is where we can support.",False

I am raising money for a school trip to Borneo in 2021. Here is some more information about what we will be doing on our trip:    Borneo has the world’s oldest primary rainforests  dating back 140 million years  that are home to 200 species of mammals  400 species of birds and 15 000 species of flowers. Many of these can only be found in Borneo. Some of these include the endangered Bornean Orangutans  Proboscis Monkeys  The Pygmy Elephant and the Hornbill.     On this wonderful journey I will be learning about:    · conservation  the protection of endangered species and traditional cultures    · Biodiversity  ecosystems and environmental protection.    · Ecotourism and sustainable development.     During our stay we will take part in a forest rehabilitation project. This project will include learning about how conservationists and the locals seek to conserve and protect the vitally important rainforest. We will also be taught about the Borneo Fig Project which is a Rhino reserve.     During our trip we will be visiting the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre. This is a rehabilitation centre for these tiny bears as their populations are under threat due to deforestation and hunting for Chinese medicine. We will be learning about their natural environment and what the centre is doing to boost populations in the wild.     We will also be visiting a rainforest discovery centre. Here we will be going on trails through the forest  including canopy walks. We will be learning about this hugely important ecosystem.     We will be able to observe and immerse ourselves in the Kinabatangan community  while learning to make boats  fish traps and many more things!     The most exciting part of the trip for me is the Jungle trek where we will begin learning bush skills and jungle survival techniques. We will be fire lighting and setting up hammocks to sleep in!         Covid 19 however  has deterred our Borneo groups from making money easily. Therefore  we have tried to think of ideas that are within the legal boundaries during this time  which has led us to the conclusion of exercise! Lots and lots of exercise! We have opted for cycling.     Eight others in my Borneo group and I have decided to link our fundraising with the current situation and are going to cycle the distance from Wuhan to Malmesbury. (A total of 5575 Miles)  making that 620 miles each. We have set a target of September to complete this.     Individually we are collecting sponsorship for our efforts  if you are willing to contribute to my cause I have included my bank details below. I will update you periodically on my progress as I complete this challenge. I will also be donating 10% of the donations to the foodbank in Malmesbury to aid those that require a little extra help  during these difficult times specifically. Any donation  no matter how small would be gratefully received!     I also have an easyfundraising page where money is generated for my cause at no cost to you  simply by going through my link and buying what you normally would online (for example  Amazon  eBay  John Lewis  supermarkets and many more!) You can set a reminder up so that you are prompted to use it before purchase. Anything at all that you would not normally think of would be a huge help to me  for example  many are now working from home  so office supplies are required!

I can't emphasise enough how grateful we are that dad is receiving all the support he needs which allows him to be financially  physically and mentally safe and secure  I would love to see everyone as fortunate as dad.    So  I saw this video on the news earlier today and it hit me so hard that someone like Kenny  who needs to be well looked after in a hospital or care home  (as he recently had his left leg Amputated  has Type-1 Diabetes  is at high risk of COVID-19)  is firstly  removed from the hospital care he was receiving due to the Coronavirus crisis demanding more beds (which is not fair but it is just that the priority is given to those who are struggling to breathe  of course)  secondly  he is travelling about 2 hours  in his wheelchair  all alone  to get the bare minimum amount of food to be able to survive.    Why? Because his disability benefits haven't started yet  because he can't stay stuck at home and wait for someone to get him food because there is no one to help him  because he doesn't have the money to go to a grocery store nearby  so he goes through all this struggle to get food that he doesn't even feel is enough for a person to be satisfied with fully but it is better than nothing at all and so he is grateful that this service is available for people who are struggling financially.    https://news.sky.com/video/coronavirus-amputee-forced-to-travel-two-hours-for-food-11974808    I understand that many of you may be going through your own problems due to this crisis such as being unemployed and possibly struggling financially yourself  or being a key worker and having to deal with added pressure at work or you may be a vulnerable person yourself. I do not intend to make you feel guilty for being unhappy about your own issues at this time  our own problems are the biggest hurdles for us and cannot to compared to those of others  it cannot be weighed against Kenny's or anyone else's  I completely understand that.    I  however  am very fortunate to be living at home with parents and not having to worry about money  food and shelter. Due to this privilege  I have decided to do something worthwhile for others who aren't nearly as fortunate as I am and so I request you all to please take a look at the attached video and maybe do more research to see the facts for yourself and if you are not struggling financially  physically and/or mentally  then please do donate  whatever you can  to help the charitable organisation- The Trussell Trust and allow them to carry on doing the wonderful job they are persistently doing every day to help people like Kenny and many others with less or more severe hurdles.     I am personally donating to this charity myself as I am unable to leave the house right now to protect my dad  given his high risk of contracting the virus as he is a stroke patient  partially paralysed  with many other health conditions and a weakened immune system . Hence why I have decided to additionally start this fund-raising page because I cannot physically go out and volunteer to help charities like this carry on doing the crucial work that they are doing. Helping them with donations and spreading the message across is the most I can do at the moment and so  that is what I will do. Please do what you can do.    1. you can donate money through the link in this post and it will go directly to The Trussell Trust who will then allocate the money for many food banks throughout the UK : https://www.trusselltrust.org/what-we-do/how-foodbanks-work/    2. you can also join this campaign to help fast track the start date of Government funded Benefits such as Universal Credit  for everyone who desperately needs financial support so that they no longer need to collect food from food banks and can afford to buy food for themselves. If you cannot donate money then please still join this campaign to be helping in some way : https://action.trusselltrust.org/help-create-future-without-food-banks    3. you can also donate food at your local food banks. I have found the link for you to find a food bank near you more easily so if you cannot donate money but are able to give some spare bits of food away then please do so : https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/find-a-foodbank/    4. if you are unable to do any of the above then please just pray in your own ways  to any power you believe in or even just send positive thoughts and well wishes for everyone suffering because of this crisis and irrespective of it.      * let us all help in any way or in every way that we can  the least we can do is try to have and give hope.

My name is Georgia - I'm a 19 year-old student from Wiltshire. For the past few years  I have fundraised for Trowbridge's local food bank  Storehouse. In 2017  my friends and school helped me raise £500 for the incredible charity which did a world of good for those who use the food bank to survive. The work our bank does is phenomenal  providing support to those in the community who need it most.     The Goal:  My plan is to raise £60. To some  it may not seem like a lot of money  but in terms of basic toiletries and other such necessities I have often felt I take for granted  such as washing up liquid  access to sanitary products and deodorants  £60 can provide tens and tens of hygiene items to those who need it most.     With the money I raise from my own donation (which I am submitting towards the project as soon as it is launched)  alongside any donations I kindly receive through this incentive  I will be taking a planned trip to my local Tesco store and completing my shopping list (below) for the food bank  then dropping it off with them directly. I'll do this in order for Storehouse to have these toiletries and items immediately to distribute.     Covid-19:  Now  more than ever  we must stand with our community. We recognise those in need and unashamedly support them when they make the brave decision to ask for support.     I have decided to focus this effort as a Hygiene Drive  due to the current coronavirus circumstances  as practices such as hand washing as more essential now more than ever.     Thank you so much for reading - I hope it has inspired you to be able to give back to those less fortunate when you are in the position to. I will be eternally grateful for any donations anybody could contribute towards this cause  or by sharing my fundraiser or Facebook post.

I hope you're doing OK in these tough & uncertain times.     Today marks 2 months since lockdown measures were introduced in the UK. It's difficult to concisely describe the upheaval that's ensued in the wake  imparting job losses on many of the poorest low paid workers in our society. Despite lockdown putting an end to my own plans to go and coach tennis in Tamil Nadu  India for an eye-opening experience  my eyes are very much open to the far greater losses others have endured.    Thus  I had a think as to how I could help in my own way  in the covid-triggered absence of typical in-person volunteering that I love to fill my spare-time with; cycling was a no-brainer  given how much I love rolling on two wheels while promoting the mental & physical benefits of regular exercise.     However  I was also aware that  given how much time I spend on the bike  I needed to push the bounds a bit to make the activity more of a sacrifice than simply another training session; especially in light of the sacrifice our key workers are making every day in keeping the country ticking.    Henceforth  I arrived at the 300km target. Beyond the fact that it provides nice mathematical symmetry to an achievable fundraising goal for 1 week  it's over double of my usual biweekly training ride (135k). I'm undertaking it in my garden on the turbo in order to have a sustainable source of water & nutrition (especially given the covid-triggered closure of beloved cafes in my chilterns!). It'll likely take 11-12 hours to complete dependent on temperature  and will be by far & away my biggest ride to date! (Smashing the mountainous 170km I rode in the Dolomites last year!) I expect it to be quite painful after the 7 hour mark  and have been meticuklously been planning my playlist to distract from the intense quad-muscle fatigue.    Now onto the important bit; why I'm doing it? Foodbanks were already an issue of crisis in the UK before we entered this new world; between 2018 and 2019  the Trussell Trust delivered 1.6m emergency 3-day food parcels  a 19% increase on the previous year; more shockingly  annual use of the TT's services has risen 73% over 5-years  with children attributed to around a THIRD of the demand.    I've been very loud in recent times about the heightened importance of (safe) outdoor exercise right now  due to the power it holds in fighting depressive emotions and protecting our health (and subsequently  the pressured health service). But  there is no escaping the fact; if people cannot put food on the table  they cannot access these benefits; indeed  malnutrition takes more away from them than simply the ability to run 10k; 500k children arrive at school hungry each day  vastly limiting their potential to achieve highly and rise up the precarious social mobility ladder.    Thanks so much for reading this mini-essay; I hope it's struck a chord with you and provided a bitesized insight into the critical issue of food poverty today. It is saddening to contemplate  but the pandemic's dual attack on low-paid employment and public service provisions in the likely future austerity-era will only make the above figures worse. I'm aware of the awkwardness of asking for donations during such a financially-challenging time  but if you consider yourself privileged and would be able to make a contribution  I would be most grateful.      Luke xx    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE: Saturday 7th June     Hello! I hope you're all coping amidst the increasingly tragic situation displayed on the news globally. I hope this can provide a nice little positive respite and inspire more exercise fundraisers!    I've seen many of my cycling and adventure photographer heroes recently attempt the 'Everest' Challenge; this is fairly simple in nature  albeit momentous in the numbers. Basically  the aim is to climb the equivalent of Mt Everest (from sea level  not the prominence you geographic geeks) in one bike ride; this can either be done by repeating a single climb on the open road  or on a stationary turbo equipped to monitor power & gradients in a virtual course.     I'll be doing the latter for two reasons; firstly  there aren't really any long climbs in my end of the UK  and a short hill would mean thousands of reps and potentially more traffic collision risk; secondly  this is easily going to be the toughest physical challenge I've ever done! Thus  I'm going to need to have some respite in the form of accessible water and nutrition!    While the length of the ride will inevitably be shorter than 300k  averaging 100-120 from the attempts I've seen so far  the horrific gradient and 8 848m of climbing means it'll take in my estimation about 14-15hours; in addition  muscle fatigue will probably be much worse given the slower pedalling uphill vs fast flats  where motion helps to dissipate any lactic acid buildup and provide constant oxygen to my quads!    Why am I doing this abusrdity? Basically the same reasons as before multiplied 2-fold; I want to undergo some pain and sacrifice to honour the incredible work of all essential workers during this pandemic. It is a sad paradox that many of these will not be far off the food-banks this is all raising money for  given the under-inflation pay rises over the last couple of years against rising urban property prices.",False

I have always worked but have not been able to work since December 2019 due to a accident incurring a fractured foot and broken wrist and have also had hand surgery operation with another two operations to go. I’m now ready to give birth next week and need to find a way of bringing together funds  donations.

To try and help as many people as possible I am asking for an emergency donation to purchase pet food  the reason I am asking you is in extreme financial crisis people turn to charities for help. The wonderful people who normally donate to my charity are the very people who might  unfortunately  require help now. I also fear that most companies will also be unable to assist us  as they are struggling to survive and continue to support their staff.    Please help if you can.
