We cover Runnymede district and the surrounding area to provide a minimum of three days emergency food and support to people experiencing crisis.  We aim to help people in a crisis by providing food, emotional support and signposting to other services as appropriate, and in doing so, help the person or family deal with the situation they are in more effectively.  People are referred to Runnymede Foodbank by the agencies working with people in need. This could be Social Workers, Health Visitors, GP’s, Schools, Citizen Advice Bureau and many of the voluntary organisations working in the area. The food (all long life) is generously donated by local people at supermarket collections, Churches, schools and local businesses.  We serve people of all faith groups and beliefs or none. We are passionate about inclusion and being non-judgemental is central to what we do. We believe that everyone has the right to have food on their plate, dignity and hope for the future.  The Foodbank would not be able to function without a fabulous team of volunteers who sort the stock, provide a welcoming face to those in need and take part in supermarket collections and other community events.","2020-06-19 10/2020-06-12 30/2020-05-25 50/2020-05-17 15/2020-05-15 50/2020-05-14 100/2020-05-13 30/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 30/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-10 30",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=WeybridgeCovidFoodbankAppeal&pageUrl=1,2020-09-20,"Throughout Wales",,575

We sponsor and support projects in Nepal relating to: HEALTH-EDUCATION-STREET-CHILDREN-VOCATIONAL TRAINING - RABIES PREVENTION Our medical support in Nepal focuses on the burns units of two hospitals, the Kanti Children's Hospital and the Trauma Hospital both in Kathmandu. We fund weekly nutritional food baskets for each patient coming to the burns unit, as well physiotherapy and counselling 5 times per week. Every child coming on to the Burns Unit receives a 'Goody Bags' containing fun things to do to keep them amused.  We fund up to 40 skin graft operatons a year in these two hospitals. Our support at the Kanti started in 2004.  We support Mountain Heart Nepal  who deploy medical teams in times of crisis - earthquake/flood, by funding medicines for the health camp as well as funding a 'Magic Read' programme where children receive a text book covering health related information targeted at their age.  We support Papa's Children's Home for 25 children who either have no parents or a parent who can no longer take care of their child. Our support is to fund all the food costs for this home as well as a monthly activitity prrogramme. Our support at Papa's Children's Home started in 2012.   We fund a milk programme and a 'Tiffin"" meal in three schools. Our support in schools started in 2006. We support WCS (Women's Cooperative Society) with skills training. Over 160 women receive elementary and advanced training in how to grow seasonal vegetables. We fund 5 trainings per year. This empowers women to earn a good income by taking out a small loan with WCS, attending the 4 day training, then growing and selling their vegetables at market, thus enabling them to educate one or more of their children. Our support with WCS started in 2005.   We fund up to 1000 rabies vaccinations through Sneha's Care in Kathmandu and fund leaflets and posters to be used in schools and villages to educate children and adults about the dangers of rabies. Our support fighting rabies started in 2005. CHANCE for Nepal has set up an educational sponsorship programme at three schools in Kathmandu where 33 students are being sponsored for their education, in schools, colleges and University by English sponsors.  We have funded the building of 6 schools and 2 health posts in remote areas in Western Nepal. All our projects are regularly monitored by Westerners living and working in Nepal.

The establishment of the Aplastic Anaemia Patient Support Group to help families devastated by the disease and improve range of information about it, has been a very important development in holistic care.  This is something which the AAT is delighted also to support.","2020-09-14 30/2020-09-14 50/2020-09-13 250/2020-09-12 50/2020-09-11 100/2020-09-11 100/2020-09-11 250/2020-09-11 50/2020-09-10 200/2020-09-10 50/2020-09-10 30/2020-09-10 30/2020-09-10 100/2020-09-10 20/2020-09-09 250/2020-09-09 100/2020-09-09 100/2020-09-09 50/2020-09-08 100/2020-09-08 100/2020-09-08 50/2020-09-08 30/2020-09-08 50/2020-09-08 100/2020-09-07 20/2020-09-07 50/2020-09-04 100/2020-09-04 50/2020-09-04 20/2020-09-04 100/2020-09-04 50/2020-09-03 270/2020-09-03 15/2020-09-03 50/2020-09-03 10/2020-09-02 30/2020-09-02 75/2020-09-02 30/2020-09-02 100/2020-09-01 25/2020-09-01 15/2020-08-27 20/2020-08-26 15/2020-08-26 15/2020-08-26 30/2020-08-26 15/2020-08-26 20/2020-08-25 250/2020-08-25 30/2020-08-25 15/2020-08-25 50/2020-08-24 30/2020-08-24 50/2020-08-21 50/2020-08-20 10/2020-08-20 15/2020-08-19 10/2020-08-19 15/2020-08-19 100/2020-08-19 50/2020-08-19 30/2020-08-19 20/2020-08-19 100/2020-08-18 50",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=LloydsBankMidlandsCharityWalkSept2020&pageUrl=1&isTeam=true,2020-09-15,,,4721

Working closely with established and trusted organisations, schools and hospitals on the ground in Nepal, CHANCE for NEPAL gives aid and support for children and their families as well as educational and training opportunities.  We sponsor and support projects in Nepal relating to: HEALTH-EDUCATION-STREET-CHILDREN-VOCATIONAL TRAINING - RABIES PREVENTION Our medical support in Nepal focuses on the burns units of two hospitals, the Kanti Children's Hospital and the Trauma Hospital both in Kathmandu. We fund weekly nutritional food baskets for each patient coming to the burns unit, as well physiotherapy and counselling 5 times per week. Every child coming on to the Burns Unit receives a 'Goody Bags' containing fun things to do to keep them amused.  We fund up to 40 skin graft operatons a year in these two hospitals. Our support at the Kanti started in 2004.  We support Mountain Heart Nepal  who deploy medical teams in times of crisis - earthquake/flood, by funding medicines for the health camp as well as funding a 'Magic Read' programme where children receive a text book covering health related information targeted at their age.  We support Papa's Children's Home for 25 children who either have no parents or a parent who can no longer take care of their child. Our support is to fund all the food costs for this home as well as a monthly activitity prrogramme. Our support at Papa's Children's Home started in 2012.   We fund a milk programme and a 'Tiffin"" meal in three schools. Our support in schools started in 2006. We support WCS (Women's Cooperative Society) with skills training. Over 160 women receive elementary and advanced training in how to grow seasonal vegetables. We fund 5 trainings per year. This empowers women to earn a good income by taking out a small loan with WCS, attending the 4 day training, then growing and selling their vegetables at market, thus enabling them to educate one or more of their children. Our support with WCS started in 2005.   We fund up to 1000 rabies vaccinations through Sneha's Care in Kathmandu and fund leaflets and posters to be used in schools and villages to educate children and adults about the dangers of rabies. Our support fighting rabies started in 2005. CHANCE for Nepal has set up an educational sponsorship programme at three schools in Kathmandu where 33 students are being sponsored for their education, in schools, colleges and University by English sponsors.  We have funded the building of 6 schools and 2 health posts in remote areas in Western Nepal. All our projects are regularly monitored by Westerners living and working in Nepal.

Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme. Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances. Each food pack provides at least three meals for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave). In 2018-19, we provided 11,495 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 19.6% increase on the previous year. We were able to do so by receiving 130,000kg of food from public donations. Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps.

During the Coronavirus pandemic, we redesigned our services so that we could continue to offer support for those in need. COVID-19 limited face-to-face contact with the people we support because access to our centres has been severely impacted. But counselling for individuals and families, information and advice on claiming benefits and how to exercise safely are all available on the phone or via video calls. We have also introduced online support groups and produced new resources to offer as wide a range of help as possible. Since the charity was founded in 1987, we have raised £22million for support, equipment and research. FORCE receives no regular Government or NHS funding. We need to raise £1.7million every year to maintain the services we offer. That money comes almost entirely from voluntary contributions - legacies, donations, the FORCE charity shop and from fundraising events. Fantastic support from the community we serve enables FORCE to fulfil its mission to support anyone locally affected by cancer. If you would like to learn more about the work of FORCE, please call 01392 402875.

We award one scholarship per year for a taught Masters degree. A South African undergraduate scholarship was set up by staff and students at Durham University in 1964, the year in which Nelson Mandela was imprisoned and the anti-apartheid campaigner, journalist and researcher Ruth First was forced to go into exile in England. The scholarship was named in honour of Ruth First after she was murdered by South African police in 1982. She was a Lecturer in Sociology at Durham University and had been seconded to Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique. Since the end of apartheid, the Scholarship has been awarded for postgraduate study, and in 2007 we widened its scope to include applicants from Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. We choose people who show evidence of both academic promise and community leadership. People who have been active in voluntary and charity work, community initiatives, health and educational projects. Ruth First Scholars make the most of the amazing opportunity of enhancing their skills and knowledge at a leading UK university to benefit not only themselves but their communities and countries. The Ruth First Scholarship is supported by Durham University, Durham County Council and other sponsors, as well as by individual donations from staff and alumni of the University and people from the Durham area. However, we urgently need to increase the Trust's income in order to ensure that this small but powerful contribution to development in southern Africa can continue.

EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by one full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.   EFP operates 7 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme. Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances. Each food pack provides at least three meals for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave). In 2018-19, we provided 11,495 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 19.6% increase on the previous year. We were able to do so by receiving 130,000kg of food from public donations. Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps. Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres.  Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.
