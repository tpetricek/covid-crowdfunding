In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year. That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK. If you'd like more information or have any questions about fundraising please don't hesitate to contact us. We'd be delighted to hear from you. ","2020-12-24 30/2020-12-22 12/2020-12-18 52/2020-12-16 150/2020-12-11 15/2020-12-10 30/2020-12-10 20/2020-12-09 12/2020-12-08 50/2020-12-08 50/2020-12-06 30/2020-12-04 30/2020-12-02 12/2020-12-01 20/2020-12-01 12/2020-12-01 30/2020-12-01 30/2020-12-01 50/2020-12-01 15/2020-12-01 12/2020-12-01 12/2020-12-01 50/2020-12-01 50/2020-12-01 20/2020-11-30 15/2020-11-30 12/2020-11-30 20/2020-11-30 15/2020-11-30 30/2020-11-30 50/2020-11-30 15/2020-11-30 30/2020-11-30 112/2020-11-30 100/2020-11-30 50/2020-11-30 50/2020-11-30 12/2020-11-30 30/2020-11-30 50/2020-11-30 12/2020-11-30 30/2020-11-30 15/2020-11-30 10/2020-11-30 62/2020-11-30 30/2020-11-30 15/2020-11-30 15/2020-11-30 12/2020-11-30 50/2020-11-30 15/2020-11-30 100/2020-11-30 50/2020-11-30 12/2020-11-30 30/2020-11-30 20/2020-11-30 15/2020-11-30 50/2020-11-30 30/2020-11-30 12/2020-11-30 12/2020-11-30 12/2020-11-30 12/2020-11-30 12/2020-11-30 20/2020-11-29 50/2020-11-29 50/2020-11-29 30/2020-11-28 12/2020-11-27 20/2020-11-27 50/2020-11-27 50/2020-11-27 50/2020-11-27 12/2020-11-27 50/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 212/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 12/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 50/2020-11-27 250/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 50/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 12/2020-11-27 12/2020-11-27 50/2020-11-27 50/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 12/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 12/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 100/2020-11-27 12/2020-11-27 50/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 12/2020-11-27 20/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 250/2020-11-27 62/2020-11-27 100/2020-11-27 150/2020-11-27 12/2020-11-27 12/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 112/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 12/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 50/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 50/2020-11-27 12/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 12/2020-11-27 10/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 12/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 200/2020-11-27 50/2020-11-27 200/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 250/2020-11-27 250/2020-11-27 250/2020-11-27 250/2020-11-27 20/2020-11-26 1000",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=ChaucerXmasFoodbank2020&pageUrl=9&isTeam=true,2020-12-24,,,7951
3,,"56 Alleyn Road,  London,  SE21 8AH","Norwood and Brixton Foodbank Limited",False,2020-10-29,"  The Norwood and Brixton Foodbank is part of the Trussell Trust network of foodbanks that provide essential food and toiletries to people in crisis. The Foodbank was formed in September 2011 with the support and encouragement of a number of local churches. Having established distribution points in West Norwood, Brixton and Streatham the foodbank regularly feeds 10,000 people in poverty each year. Over 70 tonnes of food is needed to meet the need in our community and your donation will help us towards meeting that goal. **Corona Virus Update: Since the outbreak of Covid-19 we have adapted our parcel distribution model to ensure the safety of our clients and staff. We have developed a delivery service shipping parcels directly from our Streatham warehouse to our client's homes. Despite the huge logistical challenge this presents, and an estimated 400% increase in demand, we have still been able to provide essential food parcels to all those referred to us. Thank you for your continued donations that are making this possible**  ","2020-11-23 5/2020-11-15 15/2020-11-10 30/2020-11-10 30/2020-11-09 20/2020-11-09 30/2020-11-08 30/2020-11-08 20/2020-11-08 10/2020-11-08 20/2020-11-08 16/2020-11-08 15/2020-11-08 15/2020-11-08 15/2020-11-08 5/2020-11-08 30/2020-11-08 20/2020-11-08 30/2020-11-08 20/2020-11-08 50/2020-11-08 25/2020-11-07 20/2020-11-07 5/2020-11-07 17/2020-11-07 20/2020-11-07 15/2020-11-07 15/2020-11-07 50/2020-11-06 50/2020-11-05 10/2020-11-04 15/2020-11-04 10/2020-11-04 50/2020-11-04 100/2020-11-03 15/2020-10-31 30/2020-10-31 20/2020-10-29 20/2020-10-29 20/2020-10-29 20/2020-10-29 15/2020-10-29 50/2020-10-29 15/2020-10-29 100",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=4LFoodbankchallenge&pageUrl=1&isTeam=true,2020-11-23,,,1362
4,,"120 Laugherne Road,  Worcester,  WR2 5LT","Worcester Foodbank",False,2020-11-27,"The Mission of Worcester Foodbank To end hunger and food poverty in our city.  We aim to help people in crisis who are referred to us by local agencies, by providing food parcels and other essential household products in a non-judgemental place.  Since June 2012 Worcester Foodbank has provided a lifeline to thousands of people and families that cannot afford to eat. Through food and cash donations we are able to supply 3 day emergency food parcels to those in financial crisis. With every passing year we have seen the demands on our service rise as the pressure of low income, benefit issues, debt and issues following the rollout of Universal Credit drag more people into crisis. The support Worcester Foodbank provides helps to restore people with a fresh hope for their future.  By the end of this year we anticipate that we will have provided food parcels to feed over 10,000 people and over 53,000 since opening in June 2012.  That will represent about 665,000 meals, and 665,000 occasions upon which someone did not go hungry.   Our Vision and Values Worcester Foodbank operates under the Charitable status and Trustee governance of All Saints Church, Worcester, and under a franchise from the national foodbank charity, the Trussell Trust. Our vision and core values reflect both organisations; and we are committed to: In all of this we seek to remove the need for our services by reducing food poverty in this country. Our strategic aim is to close because we are no longer needed.","2020-12-03 50/2020-12-02 15/2020-12-01 20/2020-11-30 30/2020-11-30 20/2020-11-30 20/2020-11-30 30/2020-11-30 20/2020-11-27 100/2020-11-27 20/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 20/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 10/2020-11-27 50/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 100/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 50/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 15/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 10/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 10/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 20/2020-11-27 20",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=PrimesChristmasFoodbankFund&pageUrl=1&isTeam=true,2020-12-03,,,905

In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year. That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK.

The Foodbank was formed in September 2011 with the support and encouragement of a number of local churches. Having established distribution points in West Norwood, Brixton and Streatham the foodbank regularly feeds 10,000 people in poverty each year. Over 70 tonnes of food is needed to meet the need in our community and your donation will help us towards meeting that goal. **Corona Virus Update: Since the outbreak of Covid-19 we have adapted our parcel distribution model to ensure the safety of our clients and staff. We have developed a delivery service shipping parcels directly from our Streatham warehouse to our client's homes. Despite the huge logistical challenge this presents, and an estimated 400% increase in demand, we have still been able to provide essential food parcels to all those referred to us. Thank you for your continued donations that are making this possible**  ","2020-11-23 5/2020-11-15 15/2020-11-10 30/2020-11-10 30/2020-11-09 20/2020-11-09 30/2020-11-08 30/2020-11-08 20/2020-11-08 10/2020-11-08 20/2020-11-08 16/2020-11-08 15/2020-11-08 15/2020-11-08 15/2020-11-08 5/2020-11-08 30/2020-11-08 20/2020-11-08 30/2020-11-08 20/2020-11-08 50/2020-11-08 25/2020-11-07 20/2020-11-07 5/2020-11-07 17/2020-11-07 20/2020-11-07 15/2020-11-07 15/2020-11-07 50/2020-11-06 50/2020-11-05 10/2020-11-04 15/2020-11-04 10/2020-11-04 50/2020-11-04 100/2020-11-03 15/2020-10-31 30/2020-10-31 20/2020-10-29 20/2020-10-29 20/2020-10-29 20/2020-10-29 15/2020-10-29 50/2020-10-29 15/2020-10-29 100",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=4LFoodbankchallenge&pageUrl=1&isTeam=true,2020-11-23,,,1362

We're a member of The Trussell Trust's Foodbank network. We're a community response to food poverty and we work hard to provide the best service we can for local people in crisis, helping to signpost to other agencies which can help break the cycle of poverty and avoid the need for longer dependance upon foodbank support. Many people volunteer their time for us freely and gladly, but we still need to pay the rent, fill up our van with fuel and lots of other little things. It all adds up - as it does for any of us - so any contribution you can make to support our work would be immensely appreciated. The Covid 19 pandemic has undermined most areas of our work against a substantial increase in demand and we have had to scramble to reinvent our operations to maintain our vital work for those in financial crisis, including for the first time needing to purchase food on occasion to keep vital support going.   No one should be going hungry in our Country. Thank you for your support at this difficult time. If you are able to support us financially, you can do so in several ways: 1. Donate online Click on the red 'make a donation' link to make a one off small donation via VMG.   2.

EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by three full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.   EFP operates 8 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme. Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances. Each food pack provides at least three meals/per day for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave). In 2019-20, we provided 16,984 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 73% increase on the previous year. We were able to do so by receiving 190,000kg of food from donations. Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps. Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres.  Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.

In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year. That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK. If you'd like more information or have any questions about fundraising please don't hesitate to contact us. We'd be delighted to hear from you. ","2020-12-21 20/2020-03-27 35/2020-03-26 30/2020-03-26 20/2020-03-17 20/2020-03-17 20/2020-03-16 25/2020-03-16 30/2020-03-16 30/2020-03-16 20/2020-03-16 30/2020-03-16 15/2020-03-16 20/2020-03-16 30/2020-03-16 15/2019-12-20 10/2019-12-20 30/2019-12-20 15/2019-12-20 20/2019-12-20 15/2019-12-20 50/2019-12-20 15/2019-12-20 20/2019-12-16 15/2019-12-15 30/2019-12-13 20/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 30/2019-12-11 10/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 30/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 10/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 10/2019-12-11 20",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=VirginRED&pageUrl=1,2020-12-21,,,870
