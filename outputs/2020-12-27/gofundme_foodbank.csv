Born in Tripoli  Northern Lebanon and operating in refugee camps in the Bekaa Valley throughout the COVID pandemic  we are now responding to the Beirut blast.     With the full endorsement of the Lebanese Foodbank  each of our ovens is capable of producing over 1 000 meals per day. Our plan is to greatly increase this reach by expanding our number of oven sites nationwide.     Our Work To Date    Today  the Great Oven HQ is located next to the epicenter of the blast site  in Lebanon’s most respected nightclub of all places  the Ballroom Blitz. Each day  between 10 - 20 local volunteers contribute to the preparation of meals and supplies which are then distributed to our oven sites.     Over a month on from the blast  with media fatigue setting in and many temporary relief efforts already withdrawing  our work is crucial. We believe that responses to Lebanon’s escalating crisis must be long term in their vision and center the Lebanese people as agents of their own reconstruction and resilience-building process.    By its very nature  The Great Oven is uniquely positioned to provide assistance through this framework. Not only do we set up enduring networks but our ovens are permanent installations that belong to the communities in which they are based. As centres for cooking  teaching and sharing a meal  our ovens facilitate a creative and participatory experience that brings communities together and fosters social cohesion.     Where will your support go?    The Great Oven has self-funded its operations for over two years. We are proud of our self-sustainability but now feel it is time to grow. We can’t do this without your support.    Each kind donation will be used to fund our basic operational costs  all of which are listed below:    - Production and installation of more community ovens in areas of critical need in Beirut and nationwide  - Sourcing local food produce for each oven  - Distribution of food beyond Great Oven sites across the city  - Oven transport and logistics     Our only paid salaries to date  go to marginalised people we founded our movement with. This includes LGBTQ refugees  stateless youths  trafficked women  and ex child fighters to name a few.     More about the Great Oven    We build great big beautiful ovens to feed a great number of people.     But the oven is also symbolic. It represents our belief that the ritual of cooking and sharing meals helps bring communities together  whatever their faith  ethnicity or gender.     We also believe in the rehabilitative power of music and art to restore faith that a better future is possible.     What we offer is not aid in the traditional sense  but the participatory tools to empower a community to build that future for themselves  and with those tools comes an inherent sense of dignity  which is as important as food relief in nourishing a marginalised community.     We work with grassroots  on-the-ground  local initiatives and organisers in order to respond organically and effectively to each community’s unique needs.     What we’re offering in return     The Great Oven was founded by award-winning cook  documentary filmmaker and philanthropist  James Thompson. Our wider team is a collective of chefs  artists and creative thinkers dedicated to making positive change through food and art.     We are eternally grateful for any donation  no matter how big or small. For any substantial contributions  we would like to offer a very special thank you in true Great Oven style:    Donations of £1 000 or more    A private Great Oven feast cooked by Great Oven chefs (and special guests) at your home.    Donations of £250 or more    A seat at a one-off Great Oven community feast in one of the following locations:    Barcelona  Beirut  Berlin  Denver  Dublin  Glastonbury  Johannesburg  Kuala Lumpur  Kinsale  London  Mexico City  Mumbai  New York   Valencia    These feasts will feature several special guests of the culinary  music and art worlds.

Bishopston Comprehensive PTA are proud to present the 2020 Christmas Concert on Monday 21st December  at 7pm  on YouTube and Facebook. Links will be added here prior to the event. We will be supporting local charities with all donations going to the Swansea Food Bank and the Redcafe  whose primary function is to support those in need. This includes local youth work  supporting local people with dementia and the Mutende Project – a school and orphanage in Zambia  where they are building ‘The Bishopston Classroom’. We do hope  this year especially  you will give generously to support those in need.  Pupils have been filmed  in their bubbles  at atmospheric locations including Murton Methodist Church  the Brangwyn Hall and with stunning views of Pennard Castle and Three Cliffs Bay from the grounds of Pennard Golf Club. The concert has something for everyone  with music from the orchestra  choirs and soloists as well as readings and dances. At the end of what has been a very challenging year we do hope you will enjoy this truly amazing concert and the work of our incredibly talented pupils.  The PTA would like to pass on enormous thanks to Mr. Andrew Millard and the Music Department  Mrs. Angela Dennis and the Drama Department as well as every single pupil for taking part. Thanks also go to Dan Evans  from RedCafe  Mumbles  who filmed the event for the school  and Pennard Golf Club and the Rev. Walker for allowing us to use their facilities  along with Gower Christmas Trees who donated the tree to school for use in Murton Methodist Church.

industry  from editors  booksellers and authors  to publicists  agents and designers  are donating money to go towards helping the acute crisis in poverty and hunger amongst the least well off in the country.    We live in a nation where more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. The Trussell Trust has given out over 1.6 million packs of food supplies in the past year alone. Food Banks are not just a place to pick up essential sustenance  with cuts to community centres and frontline services they have also become mini-welfare and advice centres.    We're aiming to raise £5000 before Christmas 2019  which will go to the Trussell Trust. Your donation will directly help those most in need of support. It is vital that those working in publishing come together as a community and take action.    It is important to help those in greatest need but solutions must also be found to the reasons people find themselves in need of food banks.    The Trussell Trust’s CEO Emma Revie has indicated that the benefits system has been driving a rise in foodbank use– the charity released their State of Hunger 2019 report in November.    “This is the busiest six months we’ve ever seen – more people than ever before are being forced to foodbanks’ doors ” said Revie. “Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty  but currently thousands of women  men and children are not receiving sufficient protection from destitution. This is not right. But we know this situation can be fixed – our benefits system could be the key to unlocking people from poverty. We need to put money back into the pockets of people who most need our support. It’s in our power as a country to end the need for foodbanks. This can change.”        Thank you for your support.

Our party no longer trusts in the ‘generosity’ of Westminster to bridge the centuries old North-South divide. This tried and tested approach is destined to fail. The centrality of London  with its capacity to gobble-up all of this country’s assets  is built into the very fabric of the ‘United Kingdom.’ Infrastructure  people  resources  opportunities: all filter south by design. We believe  then  that only through a referendum – with a resounding ‘yes’ – will we solve  once and for all  that vast array of economic and social disparities that split this island in two. We have over 200 active volunteers using a free Slack workspace. But we have hundreds more signed up and waiting to join. Our next obstacle to overcome is to invest in a membership system and organisational tools so we can become sustainable and begin organising activities leading up to us challenging council seats in the local elections of 2021.     We are a transparent party run by ordinary Northerners. We have no secret donors or other means of generating an income. Our spend to date on the movement was £1.19 to register a domain name. But we have reached the point where we cannot go any further without incurring some additional expenses.

We have had a lot of people offer donations and requesting a fundraiser so we have created this for anyone wanting to help. Any donations leftover will be used to help local foodbanks. We will be making free packed lunches throughout the half term for children. If anyone is struggling to make ends meet  please drop us a message (will be strictly confidential) and we will provide a pack up for your children starting from the 27th of October through the half term. We will ensure we are in full PPE whilst making pack ups for hygiene reasons and to avoid risk of contamination  and can arrange delivery/collection.     We understand times are hard at the moment and we want to do our bit to support families and children  please do not hesitate to message us. This is entirely self funded so if anyone would like to donate that would be amazing. Please share and spread the word!!!!!    #nochildgoeshungry #endchildfoodpoverty    Please note we both are trainee primary school teachers and both have a DBS and will also always abide by social distancing rules.

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.    All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.    If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free. Thankyou for your support.    The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need  providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.    All the best    Jack Monroe.

We are facing an unprecedented challenge and so any donation will be warmly welcomed as we continue to support people most in need.    I am Rev Carol Bostridge  Senior Project Manager of Lewisham Foodbank  I live in Sydenham and have been employed part-time by the Foodbank for 5 years.     All donations given via this campaign will be used by Lewisham Foodbank to either purchase food for our clients or enhancing the service we offer (eg providing volunteers with gloves  setting up a delivery service for those self isolating and purchasing addition equipment as needed).

My name is Nicole and I am a barber from Warrington  and during our national lockdown  alot of my customers had to shave their own heads due to not being able to get a hair cut. So shaving my head seemed a fitting way to raise money for Warrington foodbank!   I will be shaving my head on Friday the 13th of November and live streaming it to facebook so you can all have a bloody good laugh at me   Every penny counts  so even if you can only donate a small amount... I will be forever grateful.  This is such an important service used by many in such challenging times.

But the coronavirus epidemic will be a massive challenge for them  on a whole new scale. More and more people are going to need their help over the next few months.    People on zero hours contracts won't get paid.    Food will need to be delivered to the elderly and sick who are self-isolating.    If schools close  many children will lose their main meal and need to be fed.    And all this is happening at a time when the rest of us are going to the supermarket less and - let's be honest - thinking about our own food cupboards first.    So  here's a very simple way to help. You give money. Every time we get to £100 I ask the foodbank what they need most and go and get it. If things get really bad  I will organise a delivery. We all keep doing this over and over again until things get better.      Why aren't Fair Frome doing this? Well  they've got a heck of a lot on their plate right now and this is one way I can take the load off them. It's also easier for me to set up a fundraiser as an individual.    Who am I anyway? Good question  I have volunteered for the food bank before  and here I am with Lenka  their co-ordinator  in the food bank. Fair Frome know that I am making this appeal and are very happy to have the fundraising happen.      I will post the receipt on here every time I go shopping.    But if you're still worried  please do take some food to the Fair Frome collection points in Sainsburys  Asda  Frome Wholefoods and Barnardos instead.       Frome is a great community. Let's channel this and do our best to see all our town through the next few months.    ",True

HUBC race at this regatta every year and it has turned into an event which is loved by alumni and also marks the start of summer. As it is has been cancelled  The Blue Blades have challenged HUBC to a race on the weekend of June 13th and June 14th. (The date of Durham Regatta) We will be racing the distance by foot and/or bike of 260 miles/419km  the distance from Hull to Durham and back.    All proceeds will be going to The Trussell Trust  a charity which provides emergency food and support to people locked in poverty  as well as leading a campaign for change to end the need for food banks in the U.K. With the current COVID-19 pandemic  food banks are a vital resource and are experiencing a significant rise of people using their services  so every penny raised will go a long way.     The Blue Blades are an alumni group from Hull University Boat Club.

It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Robin Hood Fund has launched to support our city and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.    The Robin Hood Fund     Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.    In Nottingham we have a famous history of looking after one another. You could call it the spirit of Robin Hood - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.     So we are creating something called the Robin Hood Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.     Our city has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Robin Hood Fund has been set up for us to shine a light on these vital projects and help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.     Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that if possible you donate and contribute to the common good of Nottingham. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.    The spirit of Robin Hood has created something unique in our city  now is the time to reignite that spirit so please donate today if you can and if you can’t please help us spread the word.      * * *    FAQs    What can I do?    Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the vulnerable.     Where have funds been used?    Since the Robin Hood Fund started we have always had one goal  to raise as much money as possible to help those most in need.     To date; the following causes have been supported;     Since the Robin Hood Fund launched we have had one clear goal  to raise much needed funds to support the most vulnerable people in Nottingham during the Covid-19 crisis. Following an amazing response from the people and organisations of our city we have already exceeded all expectations in raising more than £75 000 which has been distributed - or is in the process of being distributed - to a number of charities and organisations undertaking such important work during these difficult times.      To date; the following causes have been supported:      Foodbanks (£20 000)    The Robin Hood Fund has distributed £20 000 in support of food banks across Nottingham. Working closely with Hope Nottingham and Nottingham Forest in the Community to deliver the wider support  food and supplies have been centrally purchased and then distributed to a number of different food banks  including: NG11 Clifton Foodbank  Meadows Foodbank  Grace Church  HOPE Nottingham  Bestwood & Bulwell Foodbank  Himmah / Muslim Hands  Arnold Foodbank and St. Ann’s Advice Centre.      Homeless Organisations (£10 000)    Emmanuel House was awarded £6 000 for additional specialist key worker support to boost its team at a time when Nottingham’s homeless community is at grave risk. This support is helping to ensure the homeless community are being placed into hotel accommodation as an emergency measure as hostels are very vulnerable to outbreaks.       There has also been £4 000 of support released to Framework to enable them to purchase essential items to the Homeless community in Nottingham. This included  but was not limited to  the provision of items such as mobile phones so that they can remain in contact with key workers and minimise the chance of these individuals being unable to stick to the government guidelines on social distancing.       Refugee Groups (£2 500)    Refugee Roots were provided with support to allow them to move from a model that required face to face contact  to being able to still provide support in a safe and socially distanced way.      In addition  Refugee Forum has been provided with funding for a destitution fund to ensure those with no access to support in other places can still get support.       Vulnerable Women (£4 500)    Nottingham Women's Centre have been awarded funding to help them to provide mental health support and online counselling  including training for counsellors to be able to provide online support.      In addition to this  further support was provided to POW Nottingham  an organisation supporting the rights of sex workers and those at risk of being exploited. This funding enabled them to purchase essential items including food and toiletries.      Disability Groups (£2 500)      With social distancing measures causing increased issues for the disability community in Nottingham  this support has enabled the Disability Support Nottingham organisation to increase its capability to provide phone support - in addition to welfare checks - to those in need.      Vulnerable Young People (£2 500)     Funding has also been provided to help support the amazing work of Nottingham YMCA  who are working with the most vulnerable young people in our city during this crisis. The support has helped to provide food and toiletries to those housed in supported YMCA and transitional accommodation.      Where will the funds go?    The most vulnerable people during this crisis and will be administered by the city council and delivered by people and organisations across the city that can help the most vulnerable.    Every Monday Nottingham City Council will administer the release of funds from GoFundMe to Nottingham City Council bank account. This means Nottingham City Council should  on average  have the money in the bank no later than Friday of every week.    Once in Nottingham City Council account the funds are ring fenced and held until the decision re: allocation has been made.    A working group  chaired by Lee Walker  will be set up to recommend how that branch of funds is released. This group is tasked with making the biggest impact possible whilst also being certain that the organisations in receipt a) need and b) promise to spend quickly ie. nobody saves the money. On Tuesday of each week the working group will have a paper approved by a member of ‘gold’ and paperwork will be sent to a small governance committee who are tasked with ethics and assuring the highest standards of governance and distribution.    Remotely the governance group will scrutinise and approve. Once approved Nottingham City Council agrees to distribute as agreed.    Money will then go out asap so groups and organisations are in receipt within 5 days. A one page press note to support and communication online to be transparent.      If I do donate will it go to those who need it?     Yes  100% of any donation will go to those who need it.    I want to help my local community; will this money be spent in Nottingham?     Yes.

Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland. Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen feed people seven days a week and will now be able to buy pallets of fresh produce to cook with  whilst the foodbank will be able to use the money to produce emergency three day food parcels.

So  I have drawn pumpkins in the windows of businesses all over Didsbury for families to find in a pumpkin hunt  all to raise money for Chorlton & Didsbury Foodbank.     Chorlton & Didsbury Foodbank helps so many in our community who have fallen on hard times. They have seen a year-on-year growth in the amount of need there is for them. Last year they gave out 1 915 three-day emergency food supplies. In light of COVID-19  that number will surely rise this year.     The amazing volunteers who run the foodbank need all the help we can offer. No one in our community should have to go hungry.

We now have 50 active volunteers and we have been able to assist hundreds of people  so far!    Currently  every Wednesday and Saturday evening our volunteers are able to provide the following help:    • We distribute food packs to a local shelter for homeless people  • We set up a stall from 5.30pm to 6.30pm next to Tooting Broadway Market where we serve hot food  soups  drinks and hand out toiletries and sanitary products  • we have recently opened our foodbank based at 104 Upper Tooting Rd  SW17 7EN  walk up Price Close. Fridays 9-1pm food donations drop off. Fridays 11-1pm open to guests to collect what they need. Our outreach volunteers visit known places where homeless people sleep in the local community and we provide them with a hot meal  a hot drink  toiletries and sanitary products and sleeping bags  • Our outreach teams are now able to serve people in areas of Wandsworth (Clapham Junction  Putney High Street  and Clapham South / Common / and North.      We urgently need donations so this much needed work can carry on in the community.     Please help us to help those in need.      Tooting Community Kitchen",False

They each grew up in poverty and it is still a daily concern for themselves and their families  especially now with the economic impact of COVID-19.  They are motivated to help others who need food and health support.  They all have a physical disability due to either birth defects  illness  or accidents (landmine  traffic  industrial etc.).

Who is the Inspiration behind the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event and The Siem Reap Food Bank    Naret Chhoy  is a jewellery and clothing designer and Director and Trustee at Genevieve’s Fair Trade Village in Siem Reap. The shop supports and celebrates the work of people and artists living with disabilities.     Having lost her job with the closure of the shop since the outbreak of the pandemic  this incredible and inspiring woman  with her own disability  is devoting her time and amazing efforts to help some of the most vulnerable families in the community with Essential Care Food Packs.    Naret is one of the amazing 9 Cyclists riding in the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event to raise money for the Siem Reap Food Bank that her and many other volunteers founded in April to support vulnerable families in need of food support due to Covid19.       Your Generous Donation Today Can Help by Feeding a Family of 4 for 80 pence a Day with the Siem Reap Food Bank.    The Basic Care Food Package costs just £26 pounds  which can feed and help sustain an average family of 4 people for one month!    That's less than the average family of 4 people in the UK would spend on one takeout meal a month!     Donor Fees​ - GoFundMe adds a default Tip of 15% to each donation to help them maintain and improve their free platform. The GoFundme Tip is voluntary and you can change the default tip amount when you donate. The minimum donation amount is £5    There are so many families that need your help more than ever  with your kind and generous support your donations (no matter how much you can afford to give ) means we can help keep their physical and mental health intact throughout this Covid19 Pandemic by helping them survive  whilst offering them a glimmer of hope for the future.     Siem Reap Province - Cambodia    Siem Reap is a beautiful idyllic tourist town just a stone's throw away from the spectacular Angkor Wat Archeological Park in Cambodia.    ""If you have ever been to Siem Reap  or Cambodia in general  you will know how warm  friendly  kind and compassionate the Khmer people are"".    Since the lockdown began  hardly any tourists are visiting the city  with visitor numbers to the Angkor world heritage site down by 99.5%  only 650 people visited the Temple in the month of April  that's 20 people per day compared to around 5 000 back in January.    This situation has created a major problem in Siem Reap. The average wage in the city for people who worked within or in connection with the tourist industry is around $4 USD per day  that's less than $3.50p for around 10 hours work or 35 pence an hour.    The city is more or less totally deserted with literally no visitors  there is no money being spent  no income….nothing…zero. As you can imagine  if you were only earning $4 a day ""in normal circumstances""  then you can probably understand why many families really don’t have any ability to save money to help themselves get through the times when the going gets tough…really tough.     There are many reports of people hearing children crying themselves to sleep at night through hunger.     Many families are trying to live off the land by foraging for fruit and vegetables  frogs  snakes and Rats etc  but the basic essentials that we all take for granted in the UK such as Rice  Eggs  Cooking Oil  Salt and Sugar are products that thousands of families in Siem Reap simply can no longer afford.     Real Hunger exists  in Siem Reap Province  because a large number of families  living at or below the poverty line  do not have enough money to consistently put food on the table.    Job losses  due to Covid 19  have pushed the total number of hungry families to an estimated 20 000. That means as many as 80 000 souls in the Province  are going bed hungry tonight without knowing where there next meal will come from.    Why the Siem Reap Food Bank?    Having lived and experienced an amazing life in South East Asia for over 18 years  I wanted to contribute in a meaningful way  to help some of the most vulnerable people through the ongoing Covid 19 crisis.    After many discussions with my wonderful friend  Christopher Leonard who is currently living there and witnessing first-hand the stone cold reality of the situation  we decided together to spend considerable time researching and validating food giveaway programs currently operating in Siem Reap.    Christopher  spent quality time with Naret and Rick and we could both see that with more money  international awareness and resources  The Siem Reap Food Bank could reach out to so many more families in desperate need of support.    The Siem Reap Food Bank continues to make a real sustainable difference to people in risk of extreme poverty and hunger.     So I decided to volunteer my time to support this incredibly important project and I wanted to share with you why I have chosen this specific Food Bank.    The Siem Reap Food Bank initially launched in April to provide Essential Care Food Packages to people living with disabilities to help them survive the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.     The Siem Reap Food Bank support families headed by or including people with a disability  that have seen their livelihoods disappear  along with the tourists and shops  restaurants  hotels and businesses being shut down.    With the situation continuing to get worse it soon became clear that the Siem Reap Food Bank would not just need to support families with disabilities through this unprecedented time  but any families identified to be in urgent need of an Essential Care Food Package to help them survive.    How Your Kind Donation Helps These Families:    Below is one example of a family the Siem Reap Food Bank is helping every month with a £26 Essential Care Food Package:    Mai Lin  a single mom of 4 children  all under the age of 12  suffered a paralysing stroke about 5 years ago. At the time  she was overwrought with fear that she would no longer be able to take care of her babies.     However  she learned how to make shopping bags from old newspapers and the income generated was sufficient for her to support her family and was even enough to send her children to school. Mai Lin’s income dried up completely with the closure of the Genevieve’s Fair Trade Village shop that sold her products  at the onset of the CoVid19 shutdown.     Along with her first food drop  just before Khmer New Year (April 13th 2020)  came the promise of monthly food drops until she is able to get back to making a living for herself to ensure her family survives.      What's Contained in a Monthly Essential Care Food Package:      We only need 1 000 people from across world to donate as little as as £10 pounds (less than then the price of a few takeout coffees) to succeed in reaching our campaign goal to support 100 families.    Please  help us meet our funding goal by making any donation you can afford.     We know that this is very tough time for many  so if you are unable to donate funds can please help us by sharing this appeal in any way you can via ( social media  friends and family as well as any networks you have connections with) help us create awareness and momentum for this ongoing humanitarian crisis.    On behalf of the families you are helping  thank you for your kindness  you really are making a life changing difference.    Myself and Christopher are volunteering for the Siem Reap Food Bank  with Christopher managing the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event and I'm helping to create awareness for the gofundme campaign.     GoFundMe does not operate in Cambodia. Therefore  I started this campaign in the UK on their behalf with a Funding Goal to support 100 families that's 400 hundred people we can help and support over the next six months.     We project that at the very earliest tourists may return to visit Angkor Wat  in December 2020.    Be kind - Be Loving - Be Safe    Akhun Charan (Thank you very much in Khmer)    Brian Taylor & Christopher Leonard    Important information about how funds for this campaign are being processed & delivered to the Siem Reap Food Bank    I am a volunteer for The Siem Reap Food Bank  I'll be assisting them with social media campaigns to increase UK and international awareness. GoFundMe does not operate in Cambodia. Therefore  I started this campaign in the United Kingdom on their behalf to assist them to help an many families as they can.     I solemnly pledge that 100% of all funds raised through this campaign site are automatically transferred to my UK Bank account and then transferred directly into the Siem Reap Food bank ABA bank account in Cambodia.     HOW DONATIONS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED    Our goal is to make sure the Siem Reap Food bank has continuous cash flow to purchase food & other essential items throughout the coming months  therefore monies will be transferred to their bank account on a regular basis.     The Siem Reap Food Bank Use of Funds: To purchase and distribute essential food and health items for families in need of food support living throughout the Siem Reap province.    Essential costs: To pay for the products being purchased and supplied  plus a few dollars for delivery.    The Siem Reap Food Bank accounting is up-to-date and open to inspection. ​    Donor Fees​ - GoFundMe adds a default Tip of 15% to each donation to help them maintain and improve their free platform. The GoFundme Tip is voluntary and you can change the default tip amount when you donate. The minimum donation amount is £5    ""How to change the default tip amount"" - www.gftv-sr.org/gfmtip.html    We will regularly update our gofundme page so you'll be kept informed on how much you donations are making a significant contribution in sustaining families and saving lifes.    There are so many families that need your help more than ever  with your support and donations (no matter how much you can afford to give ) we can help keep their physical and mental health intact throughout this Covid19 Pandemic by helping them survive  whilst offering them a glimmer of hope for the future.

The Foodbank provide vital food packs for people who find themselves in various difficult circumstances. It is estimated that 1 in 5 people in Northern Ireland live below the poverty line. As a result an increasing number of people in Northern Ireland  and across the UK  rely on the emergency food supplies provided by food banks.

This is why we are asking for your help. All money donated to this page will be used to buy provisions for those most vulnerable in our communities.

I'll get some sleep  then finish the final 30 laps by midday on the following day. My final lap will be at 11:55 am on the 9th; all being well.... lap number 130.

Currently  there is a huge need to help support the food banks  as so many people are needing additional help  to put food on the table  which is where the idea came from.    Many people leading up to the bank holiday would be planning where they are going to stay overnight camping or in their vans or on holiday  sadly for the VE-Day weekend that can no longer happen. So why dont we celebrate at home ?    So the idea is simple plan your trip based at home  prepare everything you need to go camping  stay overnight on the drive in your van  a tent in your garden  or even in your house (but it must be set up like a camping trip)  or in your caravan.     So how do we raise funds ?   Donate a minimum of £5 in the pot or the amount you would normally have paid for a night camping at your favourite spot during the bank holiday weekend.  If local to Nailsea  the money will go to food bank in Nailsea  if not to the national food bank network  every £ will make a difference.    Its not just about fundraising  so let's have some fun  go to town decorating your place of accommodation  take pictures  upload them to the Facebook page  use your imagination to have an amazing night or more 'away at home!'",False

My name is Charis and I'm a student from Warrington  who also swims for the Warriors  my local swimming club. For many people across the country  these last few months have been even more challenging than normal  and more families than ever now have to rely on foodbanks to feed themselves.     In partnership with the NCS (National Citizen Service Trust)  an organisation that encourages youth to give back to their communities  and WYC (Warrington Youth Club)  during August I will be swimming the equivalent distance of the English Channel crossing (approx 33km) over four open water sessions at Salford Quays with Uswim. The picture below is of me swimming under The Detroit Swing Bridge at Dock 9  Salford Quays. I want to challenge myself and raise awareness for less fortunate families that find themselves struggling in these unprecedented times.     To support my mission  please consider donating as this will provide food for those who really need it. The smallest contribution can make a huge impact on somebody's life. I think it's important to look out for others  especially now  and I feel honoured to be part of something special.    Over the course of the swim  I will be posting updates and photos on my progress as proof of my accomplishment.

A Benedictine Priory for nearly five hundred years  and then a parish church serving primarily the poor for just over three hundred years  the Cathedral now serves as the mother church of the Diocese of Swansea. It has a rich heritage that includes a gloriously carved medieval font  an arrow sharpening stone possibly used for the Agincourt campaign  and the regimental colours of the South Wales Borderers  including those from the battles of Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift. It is described in in the Pevsner Architectural Guide for Powys as ""pre-eminently the most splendid and dignified Church in Mid-Wales."" More importantly  Brecon Cathedral is a living community that continues the daily round of prayers  including Choral Evensong  and excellent worship while also serving the needs of the diocese  Brecon  and the world. We are actively involved in supporting the Brecon Foodbank and other charities  and in 2018 started the Convivium initiative to encourage thoughtful engagement between faith  heritage  and the environment. The Cathedral  however  faces serious financial problems. A medieval building is expensive to run and maintain. Even before COVID-19  the Dean and Chapter found it difficult to meet daily expenses. Additionally  the Cathedral roof is in increasingly poor condition and requires in the near future more than a million pounds worth of repairs. Thanks to COVID-19  the financial future of the Cathedral is now even worse thanks to the cancellation of services  concerts and other events.

The individual /individuals have taken tablets that were used for referrals to the fuel bank to enable those in crisis to receive an emergency payment and for a nationwide surveys into foodbank from Edinburgh university. They have taken our main hard drive /pc all are password protected . They have obviously ransacked the office and damaged our filing cabinets. Along side the items we need to replace   they have taken around £200 that was donated over the Christmas period which obviously provides much needed funds for the day to day running of the foodbank. Food was taken too  so we are putting an appeal out for tinned fish  rice pudding  tinned fish   tinned tomatoes and uht milk.   We as a charity can little afford the extra costs incurred to replace the more valuable items and office furniture. Any donations will be greatly received and used to help to wider community .      As stated our original target was £1000 and we have blown away by the generosity of the wider public. I am one of the merry band of volunteers at Oldham Foodbank. We offer assistance to those in crisis with food parcels for 3 days . As we have smashed our target   extra money raised will be used to enhance our current security systems to prevent ourselves from being targeted again . Furthermore the money raised will secure day to day expenses of the Foodbank for the foreseeable future   enabling us to continue to provide to those in need and crisis.   All monies raised is to be transferred to Oldham Foodbank bank account which is run by our Trustees.     Update on 17/5/19     We are in the process of withdrawing funds   The funds will be withdrawn via the manager of the Foodbank and promptly transferred to the Oldham Foodbank account which the Trustees will be able to allocate funds as we require them .   Once again Thank you   a photo showing the transfer and statement will be placed via this page for transparency.     ",False

These are essential food and toiletries boxes for those in our community who are suffering financially during the COVID-19 crisis.    This campaign is being organised and managed by a small group of WAMA admin volunteers from Wotton-Under-Edge and surrounding villages.    Although some goods are donated  they are mostly bought through local shops and we need funds to buy fresh fruit  vegetables and dairy produce.    If we still have money left from this campaign once we are no longer in operation  all outstanding money will be donated to Stroud and Wotton Foodbanks.    If you know anyone who would benefit from a WAMA Box during this difficult time  they can easily apply for one by Clicking Here to fill out one of our forms  or by calling 07545 042794 to speak to one of our volunteers.    If you know of anyone who would like other types of support like picking up shopping  delivering prescriptions or receiving a friendly phone call from a neighbour  you can request that on the number above or by Clicking Here to fill out our request for help form.    If you request a WAMA box  we will keep your information confidential and will only share it with a very small team of WAMA Box delivery volunteers.    We know that many people will look to family and friends for assistance during the COVID-19 outbreak  and Wotton Area Mutual Aid group is here to make sure that no one is left alone  by connecting people in need  with volunteers who are available to help out.",False

In the meantime the government intervened and the free school dinner row has made us realise that we need to be making food available now. While we still set up the shop we will be opening to distribute any food we can get. We hope in the next few weeks to use The Institute in Ottery St Mary as a proper community resource to make sure that no one in Ottery goes hungry.        It seems a lifetime ago that we first heard of Covid-19 but it is sometimes hard to believe it has only been a few short months. Back at the start of March a local Ottery St Mary resident floated an idea on social media. Her idea was to create a volunteer team to help the “at risk”  elderly  self-isolating and key workers in our community.     From that seed of an idea  in one week over 400 local residents signed up to join and selflessly come to the aid of those around them. Ottery Community Volunteers (OCV) became a reality. Now a unregistered Not for Profit organisation the group has already mobilised to provide vital support to the local community.     What is the purpose of the group?     OCV have three key objectives:     • To establish and sustain for an extended time  a volunteer force capable of supporting our community.     • To minimise the transmission and infection rates of Covid-19 by reducing the footfall within our community and supporting people in isolation.     • To maintain a robust and enduring volunteer operation for as long as is needed  resilient enough to support our community.     What are we actually doing for our community?     The volunteer network is already operational and working in our community. We have divided the volunteer network into priority areas:     Pharmacy Group – collecting and delivering prescriptions for the target people.     Deliveries Team – focused on doing shopping for food & essential supplies  delivered to homes for those self-isolating & vulnerable  reducing the footfall of people in town.     Befriending Group – working alongside the Ottery Help Scheme we offer befriending telephone support for those in need of someone to talk to during their isolation    Foodbank Team – Our volunteers also work with Ottery Foodbank  supporting their essential efforts.    Mental health wellbeing service to our volunteers  run by volunteer healthcare professionals.    Finance team - Using prepaid cards to minimise the use of cash and the risks for transmission of Covid-19  as well as ensuring robust financial accountability.    Why are we fund raising?     Whilst OCV has already started work  up until this point we have relied upon a great deal of good will from volunteers and businesses. In order for us to offer a safe  sustainable  efficient and professional service for our local community we need funding. We recognise that there will be a requirement for active community support for many months to come. We will be using the funds raised to cover a wide range of budgeted costs including:     • Safeguarding training including Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks for volunteers     • Insurance    • Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)     • Volunteer out of pockets expenses including mileage claims     • Stationery & consumables    • Software licences     • Printing and postage    • Staffing & resources    Thank you.",False

To keep this vital work going we hold regular fundraisers (mainly coffee mornings with the most delicious cakes!) and are very fortunate to receive a lot of support from our community.    We receive referrals from a range of professionals and organisations  such as health visitors  social workers  foodbanks  the Citizens Advice Bureau  Women's Aid and schools. All of these referrals are on behalf of families very much in need across Cumbernauld  Kilsyth and the surrounding area.    We provide a package of new and pre-loved items. We are incredibly fortunate to receive many donations of pre-loved items that can used by another family  but we still have to buy lots of items new. This includes moses basket and cot mattresses (for safety reasons)  socks and pants  and branded school uniform items like blazers.    For more information  please visit our Facebook pages and our website:     Cumbernauld & Kilsyth School Uniform Bank    Cumbernauld & Kilsyth Baby Bank    Cumbernauld & Kilsyth Care    Thank you!    The Cumbernauld & Kilsyth Care team    ***UPDATE***    We currently have a large volume of referrals  including requests for mattresses and school blazers. We urgently need the funds to buy these items for families struggling to get these themselves. We have families who need cots with new mattresses for babies who have outgrown their moses baskets  and blazers for young people who are standing out from their peers because their families can't afford to buy a blazer that fits (we have appealed for pre-loved ones  but no luck yet).",False

Homelessness is soaring. Hunger is spreading. We need not only food banks - but foodbank warehouses to feed desperate families. The most vulnerable are being stripped of the benefits they desperately need. The Tories’ austerity is destroying lives.    This is not justice. It’s a Tory choice. It’s not acceptable. It’s not inevitable. And there is an alternative.    The story of the West Midlands is becoming like a ‘tale of two cities’. There are cranes in our skies. But our homeless neighbours are sleeping in the doorways beneath  where someone now dies every fortnight.    Our society feels like it’s ripping apart. Brexit has divided us. In its wake  hate crime and violent crime has surged. Communities no longer feel safe. Islamophobia and homophobia are spiralling while the far right goes on the march.    Meanwhile  our economy is failing a generation. Over half the people in poverty in the West Midlands are in work. Half our wards are in poverty. Youth unemployment is up by a 20% while apprenticeships have collapsed. For thousands of our young people  their possibilities in life are defined by the post-code where they’re born. And looming above the crisis  is a climate that is warming faster than we thought  posing an existential threat to generations to come.    We cannot stand by and watch this happen. We cannot be by-standers. And we cannot let the Tories make it worse. If we don’t take a stand today then ten years from now  we will be more divided than ever in our history. There may be gleaming office blocks and fortunes for some. But inequality will spiral. Entrenched poverty will deepen. And the West Midlands will fall further and further behind London and Manchester.    Find out more here!    ",False

Leaving many people  and young families to go hungry in the UK  and as more and more people lose their jobs due to local and national lockdowns  they need all the support they can get!    In light of this  I’ve chosen to raise money for two local charities who help out those that are struggling whether it's with mental health and anxiety or provide food to those in need. Both charities have been affected by this pandemic and I want to help wherever possible.    Which two charities am I running for you may ask? This lockdown  I am running for Mind Buckinghamshire  throughout the current pandemic  many people have suffered from poor mental health and the isolation has intensified the loneliness that strugglers face day-to-day. Mind Buckinghamshire is a charity that is close to me as someone who suffers from mental health I have found running as a form of escapism throughout this and that it is why I am running in support of this charity.    The second charity that I am running for Aylesbury Foodbank  and with Winter settling in and Christmas soon approaching this has always been a difficult time for many people and families especially this year with so many people losing their jobs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Aylesbury Foodbank has already seen a significant rise in foodbank usage over the past few months and expect it to rise again around Christmas. I’ll be running to create food hampers for this amazing charity.    The funds raised will be divided up;    50% towards Mind Buckinghamshire  50% towards Aylesbury Foodbank    In order to raise money for these amazing charities  I’ve decided to set myself a challenge of running 5km every day during lockdown 2 (5th November - 2nd December 2020) in an attempt to give back to the community and raise funds for charities that are supporting people who are struggling during these exceptional and challenging times.    All donations no matter how small  are greatly appreciated.     Thank you     Jason    Please note; the challenge will be carried out in line with Government Guidelines",False

Reduction in food donations because of the change in shopping habits.    3. Self-isolation of some of our regular volunteers.

(That's the equivalent of a return overland trip from Guildford to Rome!)    Over 20 members of the Guildford City Swimming Club's Junior County A(&B) teams have come together to combine their shared passion for sport and fitness into a mission to travel 1889km between them over a five week period.    Why 1889km? GCSC was founded in 1889 so we thought it was a fitting target ... and a good challenge at an average of nearly 100km per person (or c. 2.5km a day).     We are all aged between 8-11 years old and will be supported by our families in our endeavour. Starting on May 25th  we will strive to cover the 1889km by any human-powered method we can - be it walking  running  cycling or even swimming if we can get access!     And we'd love to raise funds for the North Guildford Foodbank along the way. Supporting families in our local area who need a little extra help  particularly at this difficult time. It will certainly motivate us to know that we can help others at the same time as challenging ourselves  and to know that you are cheering us along as well.

The initiative is focussed on activities that benefit the community within Blackpool and the surrounding area.    Over the last few weeks  Brothers Helping Hands has been joining in with the community spirit in COVID-19 relief and support by providing lunches for all care home workers in Blackpool and thus far has provided 400 lunches across TWENTY-SIX homes in the area. We have also donated over 1 100 food items such as fresh salads  coleslaws and pastas to various foodbanks in Blackpool & the Fylde to support the vulnerable  homeless and elderly.    The Initiative has also provided ""Thank You"" drops in to all Emergency Service Stations in Blackpool and Fleetwood  with a further drop planned for Lytham over the next few days.    While we are entirely grateful to a number of organisations; namely the Greencore Group for their regular food donations  Fox's Biscuits for their substantial donations and The Gallant Pioneer for free use of their premises to run the operation from  the current levels of expenditure for accompanying food in the ""Lunches for Carers"" packs is unsustainable for the group.    The Lodge is now launching this fundraising effort to help us to continue our work  to complete our lunches for carers during the COVID-19 pandemic and ringfence funds for further potential relief in the town such as to obtain PPE for free distribution and further support to all those on the front line.    All funds will be used only by the Brothers Helping Hands initiative and if required will be ringfenced for future projects lead by the Brothers Helping Hands initiative.

And if we smash our target  then in the great words of The Proclaimers  than we'll 'walk 500 more'!     **update!**  After 5 days we smashed 500 miles so now we’re aiming for 1000!    **update 2!**  After 9 days we smashed 1000 miles so now we’re aiming for 3000!    Compassionate Acts (registered charity number 1172948) provides many essential and vital services including:    - The Foodbank  - The Pantry  - The Next Steps Cafe  - Debt Advice line  - Welfare advice  - Life Skills Training  - and much more    In March  April and May of 2020 due to Covid19 and lockdown  their usage went up to 80%  so it's incredibly important that we support them in case another surge in usage happens during this second lockdown.    Members will be completing their miles in a number of ways  including an in house competition for 'craziest/most creative miles'! If you have any suggestions or challenges for us  get in touch!

But then Coronavirus happened :( Obviously there are now way more important things happening than my birthday - vulnerable people are at risk from the virus  workers are giving every hour they have to help people live and function  and people are losing their jobs due to the economic crisis. Thankfully due to Facebook/Video chat  a lovely social circle and the bottle of wine I have stashed in the cupboard - I can still get dressed up  get drunk  get online to see my friends and have a wee party in my flat to myself.

With funds raised from this page I'll be buying vouchers/products/tickets from local businesses that would appreciate our support now more than ever. If you donate I'll pop your name in a hat then I'll livestream the draw on Saturday night - if you've made a donation then you could snap up one of the fabbo prizes on offer! So  support your local business + socialise online with your pals + watch a ridiculous drunken live stream of me = no brainer!

Market Hill Fisheries are crowd funding to cover the cost of ingredients in order to provide FREE meals for children that need them the most.    The recent decision not to provide food vouchers for children is something we feel very strongly about. Since the announcement  we’ve seen other businesses around the country offer their support to those affected and we wanted to do the same.    So this half term we would like to offer free hot meals for any child in our community that would normally have a food voucher. To claim a free meal  just ask for a ‘School Meal’ - it’s that simple.    If you know of anyone in need  please tell them that this offer is available. We’ll be doing this throughout half term whilst the shop is open  from Wednesday 28th to Saturday 31st October.     All money raised will go directly towards providing meals for children and any money remaining will be donated to a relevant charity.     Finally  we’d also ask that anyone who feels strongly about this issue to contact their local MP and tell them why you think this is so important.     Thank you.

Our initial fundraising target was overwhelmingly exceeded with donations from all over the country and we pledged to donate the money to a relevant local charity. Having researched local charities we've selected the Scunthorpe Foodbank as they serve Winterton.     Applications for foodbank vouchers can be applied for through these organisations (https://scunthorpe.foodbank.org.uk/get-help/local-voucher-agencies/). Due to COVID  the foodbank is doing doorstep deliveries to Winterton.     We're incredibly grateful for the amazing work that the Scunthorpe Foodbank do in these uncertain times.  ",True

I hope you haven't. But many  many see it often  and the need is growing whilst donations are shrinking. Demand over the last couple of weeks has tripled help has not. Can you donate just five pounds to help this crisis? My name is Andy and having lived on the streets  I know what it's like to be hungry and to struggle. I can in some small way understand the fear and worry people would face without this resource. As someone often in the church building  I see first-hand people (often not the ones we 'picture' in our minds)  but everyday hard-working families  people like us  who just need a helping hand. SO I went to Tesco to buy some food for us hoping to donate some too. But there was no food to give so I thought I could give my donation in financial terms - thus allowing Yeovil Christian Support Trust to top up their own surplus and use my gift as they require. Perhaps you would consider doing the same. Could you spare a fiver to help top up the food bank and other groups the Lords larder helps. The church link is https://yeovilcommunitychurch.co.uk and the charity is www.ycstyeovil.org.uk and ALL donations will go directly to them... helping provide food parcels and support all manner of clients in OUR town.   Because who knows in this day and age  when we may need it ourselves. Thank You. I've set the target but would love to see that broken - plus I'm happy to accept silly challenges for money!! Or to rope others in to help with this!!   Andy Robinson - for Yeovil Community (and the community church).  ",False

Through this site as well as other private donations  we raised a total of £2 215 (Q 22 747 Guatemalan Quetzales). Amazing!!!    It is time I reported back more fully on how your generous contributions are being spent.    So far  from this money  we have spent 8566 Quetzales (roughly £834) on medical examinations  care  medication and journeys. Details of these expenses can be seen below. During the process of working with the family  several issues have come to light  mostly the extreme poverty in which they have been living. Their home  which is made of sheets of corrugated iron  is very poorly constructed. It is covered in a sheet of plastic which offers insufficient protection from the weather  continually subjecting the house (and its contents) to damage from rain and flooding. The family also has no access to clean water  which has resulted in poor health  parasites and stomach infections. With regards to the operations we believed were necessary  it turns out that only Alex  the older boy  needs surgery. Alex has  however  chosen to wait until the pandemic lessens because the public hospitals continue to prioritise COVID-19 patients and it is deemed unsafe for non COVID patients. The good news is that the medical examinations showed us that the surgery appears not to be as urgent as previously believed. We will  therefore  wait until there is more capacity in the hospitals to treat non-COVID patients. It has also been agreed by the hospital  that when it does take place  the surgery can be performed without cost. We  therefore  have £1 382 to aid the family in other ways. After much discussion with the family and careful consideration  we have decided to spend your donations as follows. I hope you will support the proposal:-    Asociación Vida will be supporting the family to make improvements to their home  in particular to the roof. The estimated cost for these improvements is £563. They will also install an electric water pump system to enable them to access clean water at the push of a button (cost: £205). Doña Felipa has  unfortunately  accrued some debts as a result of their struggle to survive  and are being hounded constantly to repay the debts. We have agreed to pay off their debts which amount to £390. To help the family to avoid the need for any loans in the future  we have offered to give them £146 in order to help the mother start up an embroidery business. We are also spending £78 on necessary medical care. Asociación Vida are committed to supporting this family as they get back on their feet. As soon as Alex feels that he is happy to go ahead with the surgery  and if it is still deemed necessary  Asociación Vida will support him in journeys to the hospital and so on.    Details of the expenses and budget for the next stage of support can be found below. I know the destination of your donations has changed somewhat  but I hope that you will agree that it will go a long way in helping the family. Photos to follow in due course.

As well as running a medical centre  they work with some of the poorest communities to improve health  nutrition and living conditions. Patzún  where I lived has a lot of poverty and now  with the current pandemic  this situation has only worsened. As in the UK  people have been unwell or died from the virus and many people have found themselves unable to work - only in Guatemala there is no furlough scheme  no NHS  no foodbank and no benefits of any kind. If a household has absolutely no food  they are draping a white flag out of their home (or just holding it up in the street if they are homeless) and the village will do what they can to share their food.    Through friends of mine living in Patzún  I have recently been introduced to a widow  named Doña Filipa. She lives in a home made of corrugated iron with her three sons  Alex (17 years)  Edy (14) and Jonatan (11). The elder two boys used to help their mother with living costs by doing whatever work they could – manual work  selling ice-creams and so on. However  a month ago (on 6th May)  the sons were out collecting wood for their mother when they slipped and fell 25 metres down a ravine  resulting in one boy having a serious hip and rib injury and the other boy with broken legs. They are bed-ridden and both urgently need medical attention and operations. However  as there is no NHS in Guatemala  they would need to pay the hospital £2000 for this to take place  which is simply not possible.     We have already managed to raise some of this amount  but I wondered if  by sharing their story here  some of my lovely friends might be willing to contribute a small amount towards helping this family out. The money will be sent to Asociación Vida*  who will oversee any support we can offer this family – ideally enabling the sons to receive all the medical attention they need. Any help would be wonderful. If you want more detail about this  please message me – I just didn’t want to write too much on here. Thank you    *Asociación Vida is a registered charity  partnered by Tearfund UK.       Update: 3rd July 2020    I am so grateful to report that we have already raised over £500 towards this cause. Thank you so much for your generosity. The last few days have been spent taking the boys to the clinic in Patzún for some medical checks - and also to the hospital in Chimaltenango for X-rays and consultations with an orthopaedic specialist. The outcome of this visit is that Edy  the younger of the boys  needs an operation to correct the bones that have started to set in the wrong position since the accident took place two months ago. This operation is going to cost 20 000 Quetzales (about £2 085). The elder boy  Alex  will have an MRI scan on his back tomorrow (4th July) and from there a decision will be made about the treatment required. If you are in a position to give anything... we'd be so grateful. If you are not in a position to give financially  we would so value your prayers for these boys. Thank you so much xx      Update: 16th July    Thank you so much for your all your donations. We have all been blown away by your generosity :o)    We are still awaiting an appointment with the neuro specialist (re-scheduled for this Friday) to discuss the findings from Alex’s MRI scan. It is feared he may have serious spinal injuries  which could lead to paralysis. However  due to the COVID 19 outbreak  travelling to the capital for these appointments  amidst the government restrictions  is not proving to be easy at all.    If you are the praying type  please pray that nothing prevents this appointment with the specialist from taking place this Friday. Give thanks for all the money that has been donated and pray that it will be sufficient for both boys to receive the operations and treatment they need.    Thank you so much!      Update: 25th July    Thank you so much to everyone who has donated to this cause. Your generosity has been overwhelming.    Since my last update  the pandemic in Guatemala has worsened as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increase daily alongside the number of deaths caused by the virus. The Government’s very strict lockdown measures have also made it difficult for the boys to be taken to their hospital appointments in the capital  with police issuing fines to people who travel even for medical purposes. Nevertheless  both boys have finally received the results from their X-rays and MRI scans  which were able to take place thanks to your donations. Alex requires the most urgent surgery  as his spinal injuries could easily lead to paralysis. We await news from the hospital about when this can take place. Unfortunately  the Roosevelt hospital  where the procedure will happen  is rampant with COVID-19  with many members of staff and patients having died from the virus. This is obviously of great concern to the family  who  therefore remain somewhat nervous about their upcoming treatment.    If you are the praying type  please pray that the operations will take place soon – and for protection  healing and restoration for the whole family. Amazingly  we should have some surplus money from your donations  so Asociación Vida are making plans to offer further support to this family as well as to others who are also in great need. Please pray for wisdom for them as they seek to best meet the needs of their community at this very pressing time.    Matiox Chawe!

It has been a very long lonely poverty-stricken journey. I have tried to impact my community through volunteering in different capacities since I am not allowed to engage in any paid activities.     However  I am so limited in what I can offer  I have a language barrier. Moving to this area of England and volunteering in what is to be a foreign language has been challenging  and the experience has given me an appreciation of how languages work and how they are a vital part of our everyday experience. I hope to develop a greater intellectual understanding of languages by taking a course in French studies.     Unfortunately  I cannot afford to sponsor myself.    I am raising money for my tuition which is £500.00 and £500.00 for learning materials. I have applied for this course in the university and have till the 17th December to pay the tuition as the school will not reserve a place for me without payment According to the school  there will be studying materials we will need to purchase for a better understanding of the course but they are not yet known until our first lecture in January 2021.    I am a hard worker and have enjoyed the character-building experiences that life in the UK has to offer. During the first national lockdown  I have volunteered at hospitals and underground tube stations  presently involved with the FoodBank  an experience that I found very rewarding. I enjoyed directing and assisting visitors and participating in activities such as training  distributing facial masks  shopping for the vulnerable and the needy. I have developed a greater awareness of the world around me  as a result of both the experience of moving to a new country and my volunteering activities. Inspired by this I plan to become more closely involved in various voluntary causes which I believe make a crucial difference to the local and global community.     I am a member of the London Squad Volunteers for the UEFA EURO 2020 which will require me to come in contact with people from different countries. I am also planning to volunteer with Princes Alice and to become involved in fundraising activities. These interests and experiences have led me towards being interested in learning an additional language and I feel that the themes studied in a French course and the skills acquired would give me great help in preparing me for these roles and pave career paths for me. It will also help me to be occupied and busy and engage with people and the community. I appreciate your time in contributing to this fund. I’m looking forward to becoming a French student.

Back before all this madness started I sillily signed myself up to do my first ever half marathon  the Hackney Half on the 17th May  SO when coming into lockdown I decided that although this event was likely to be cancelled  I would still like to try and push myself to run the distance on the original date and hopefully raise a bit of money for a worthwhile charity that needs support more than ever.     I am not a runner and it has been a painful slog trying to motivate and keep training. In less than 2 weeks I'm going to attempt the 21K that I would have been running in Hackney and hope that the cheering from my family will be enough to get me round the course as opposed to the huge crowds that would have been at the real event!     I'd like to raise some money in aid of The Trussell Trust an amazing charity that supports UK food banks and every donation will help. At the moment 81% more emergency food parcels being given out across the UK  including 122% more parcels going to children compared to this time last year.    I know so many people have used food as a means to brighten up their quarantine so I think it is so important that this is shared to those who are struggling to feed their families and even put one meal on their table a day. Anything you can donate would be hugely appreciated and will hopefully help keep a family fed throughout these uncertain times.     I'll be posting the death of my running career on the 17th and knowing that we've been able to support others in need will hopefully help me get round the distance!!

I have also become aware that during Lockdown  Mark Cavendish (he’s a professional cyclist for those who haven’t heard of him) had completed a Virtual Everesting. The idea behind this is to complete a bike ride where the vertical climb is the same as the summit of mount Everest by going up and down the same stretch of road as many times as it takes to complete the 8849 meter ascent of Everest. And because I am an idiot  this sounded like something I should attempt.    Claire  Aidan and Emmy have suggested that if they are going to give up the front room of our home for a day (I’m aiming to finish it in 14hrs) then the least they should get out of it is the knowledge that some money was raised for a good cause not just pandering to my stupidity in the face of a challenge.

My life has been privileged and compared to most  easy. So instead of getting drunk on cheap wine and eating cake  I will play video games for 12 hours & raise money for two foundations that are near to my heart.     First up - Stand Against Racism & Inequality. For those who are unaware  my half-brother is black. We were adopted when we were younger  and out of our many siblings  the majority of them are black. Living in a small Illinois town they were an oddity  and racism did exist. Not a day goes by where my family & I do not worry about each other  but we worry more about the ones who can be murdered for just being black in a white world.     50% of the donations that are raised over the course of the fundraiser will be donated to Stand up Against Racism & Inequality.     You can learn more about the charity by visiting their website: https://www.sariweb.org.uk/who-we-are/about-sari/      This is not a Black Lives Matter only organization  but helps with all racism  bigotry  and sexism. But their focus is helping victims of hate crimes  and with those on the rise in the UK we can all agree that its a good cause.       The second foundation is Paddington Partnership: https://www.thisispaddington.com/paddington-partnership/about-us    They work with businesses in the Paddington area to raise money  donate their time and help out at some of the less fortunate areas of Paddington. This is interesting because our Building we work in is about 50 Million  but if I cross the street and walk 3 minutes  there's a crap block of flats full of people struggling. Paddington Partnership takes the privileged workers in these fancy offices & pairs them with programs and events to help those in need.     My team at work read with the students of King Solomon Academy every week  and have for nearly 3 years now. I personally run a monthly bookclub at the Marlybone Woman's shelter where we're currently reading David Sedaris.    On top of that  every year 3-4 groups get together to help in the community in various ways. Food banks  Soup Kitchens  putting a party on for Halloween or even gardening & cleaning the school grounds.     50% of the proceeds will be sent to Paddington Partnership to be split 3 ways between the following:    King Solomon Academy:https://kingsolomonacademy.org/about-us/welcome-2  The Marlybone Project: https://www.maryleboneproject.org.uk/  The North Paddington Foodbank: https://www.npfoodbank.org.uk/      If you are able to donate  I would appreciate it.

During the first 6 months of the pandemic  food banks saw a 47% rise in need  and the Trussell Trust sent out 1.2 million emergency food parcels. This Christmas  obviously  things are even harder; due to the pandemic  many people have been laid off  or furloughed  making it nearly impossible to live. Food and heating are luxuries  and are rationed  or even substituted.     I have never had to worry about whether or not I was going to eat that night  nor if I would be cold. More so  I would say sometimes I do not appreciate that enough.     It is SO easy to not see your privilege in some circumstances  especially when we are constantly comparing ourselves to celebrities and people who have more than us  and it’s easy to be ignorant to the fact that some people need our help.     I have set up a Gofundme for the Trussell Trust in relation to me running the 100km in a month. Small donations go a long way  donating even £2 is a big difference and a huge support . The link is in my bio.     You can also donate to @bournemouthfoodbank via the link in their bio as the cause is a lot closer to home and also needs just as much support.       As well as this  donating to food banks  with long lasting and precooked foods helps just as much! Food banks take donations in most stores such as Tesco  Sainsbury’s and Asda  most religious and community buildings as well as at the food banks themselves.      A like and share would also be very appreciated as I would like to raise as much awareness and money for the cause as possible.

Last year we ran a reverse calendar appeal where we gave a gift to a homeless shelter for their guests and food to a local food bank  however this year we are unable to do so.    2020 has been a year of many up's and down's and luckily we've managed to keep our jobs and keep working  we may have suffered stress at times but fortunately for most  we have not encountered financial hardship.     With many of us working from home and having reduced travel and commuting costs  along with not having the expense of buying lunches and coffees means we all have a little extra cash we wouldn't normally have.     Can you give one day's lunch money or whatever you feel comfortable donating to help those who haven't been fortunate enough to keep their jobs through the pandemic?    So if you can  dig deep  your donation would be greatly appreciated.     Your wonderful donation will go directly to The Trussell Trust from the gofundme page where your contribution will help those in need.

During lockdown I had a little spare time on my hands  so I started volunteering for the PO9 Foodbank  I had heard about these guys  and the good they do  but now I was about to see it first hand for myself. Throughout the Covid pandemic they helped so many families at the brink of despair. There are a worrying amount of children in our Borough who rely on their school dinners as their only hot meal for that day  that when the schools closed it was vital they had something in their cupboard to eat. And that's where the the PO9 Foodbank stepped up. Darren and his team selflessly and tirelessly put their time  energy  heart and soul in to making sure that no one and I mean NO ONE in our community goes hungry. The young  the elderly and the vulnerable are all supported. And I'm not just talking about it being for Covid  these guys do it every day  every week  every month  every year. They spend hours either talking or typing on their phones arranging donations  and taking requests and referrals for help. Then driving around collecting donations  taking them to storerooms  sorting through them  organising them  portioning them in to food parcels  (sometimes with very specific dietary needs) and finally delivering them to the front doors of those in need. The entire operation is run on Love  a whole lot of it  sweat  tears  less sleep than is healthy  stress  kindness  the most genuine heartfelt compassion I have ever seen in my life and of course  donations  whether they be in the form of food or money. Funding comes and goes  sadly. Unlike our daily need for food. And the PO9 Foodbank continues on  no matter what. So if you can  please support my chosen cause  while I ditch the bottle and give my liver a break  because these guys are awesome and need all the support they can get. ❤",False
