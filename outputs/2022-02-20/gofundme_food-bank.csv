I am a disabled activist  content creator  and single parent. My son is also disabled (he has ADHD and behavioural problems- it's relevant to this).   This past year I've tried to start creating videos and streaming leftist/communist/anarchist content specifically through a disabled lens from a family with lots of disabled members (mum  uncles  grandparents  aunts... It's a lot with varying degrees of severity but leaning more toward severe than not). This has not been easy as I have three separate conditions that cause/have the symptom of fatigue.   I've been struggling for three years with either inconsistent or non-payment of child support which affects how much ""benefits"" I'm entitled to (as I am not capable of work under capitalistic conditions and never know when my health will be worse). This has lead to my having a large debt. A debt not helped by my son's disability leading to poor impulse control and angry outbursts leading him to break usually expensive electronics in the house. Before I'd even gotten out of debt enough to try and afford to replace the latest (of three) TVs he's destroyed he broke the PC (via downloading an unreasonable amount of viruses and backdoors to the point of almost totalling it) I desperately need for video production and streaming.   While I am so deep in debt as I am right now I'm afraid regularly of not having enough money for bills  my son is concerned/anxious about access to food (not unreasonable in the UK given how many food banks we have and the times we've been driven to needing support with it). Which means I can't even think about how long it would take me to try and afford replacement components for the computer - I have a third video I can't finish making for possibly indefinitely while I am without PC and due to being also a writer/touchtypist - I also feel like my fingers have been chopped off to a degree.   I also use games  especially on my PC  as a means of pain management. Without it my options for pain management go down leaving me more vulnerable to mobile games and their predatory microtransactions (which obviously wouldn't help with my debt - for more information on why succumbing to those tactics is not just personal failing please watch or listen to various reports from James Stephanie Sterling of the Jimquisition).   In short: I need help to regain any kind of stability right now  please  if you can - I'd appreciate it. So would my son. ",True

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.    All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.    If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free. Thankyou for your support.    The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need  providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.    All the best    Jack Monroe.
