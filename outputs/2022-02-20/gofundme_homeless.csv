We are raising funds to help the homeless and mental Health   Unfortunately homelessness and poor mental health go hand in hand Around 12 Men in the UK loose their life to suicide every day Around 2 in every 8 males suffer from a mental health problem 3/4 of adults who go missing every year are male 87% of rough sleepers are male Males are 3 times more likely to become dependent on alcohol Male’s are 3 times more likely to use drugs Around 757 000 suffer from domestic violence Around 40% of men won’t talk about their mental health struggles Less think and care about the less fortunate than ourselves   Can you imagine what it feels like to not be able to shower or clean your teeth ? Or what it feels like to not be able to eat when your hungry or change your clothes when your cold and wet ? Having people walk past you and look down upon you whilst insulting you ? Enduring long cold days and nights and just dreaming of change? This is the hard cold reality of what’s really going on in our city centres  these men are someone’s son   someone’s brother   and someone’s dad they are just men like the rest of us that have been dealt some unfortunate luck. We are committed on doing our bit to help and support them   so let’s think of them at this cold festive time. We can not change the world but we can the lives of people in this world  Please help us by donating so we can help the less fortunate than ourselves ❤️  MENTalk community members will be coming together to perform a cover of Band Aid’s do they know it’s Christmas We will also be staying on the streets on Birmingham for 48hrs to show you what’s it’s really like to be homeless         Join our private community here >https://www.facebook.com/groups/wearementalkVisit us here >https://www.mentalk.onlineLike & Share Here >https://www.facebook.com/WeAreMENTalk#community #mentalhealth #mensmentalhealth #MENTALK #anxiety #mentalhealthawareness #baxi #baxiboilers #MENTalk ",False
