,,"Streets of London","Streets of London funds specialist support for people who are homeless and raises awareness about homelessness. Please lend us your support by making a donation today.  There are many great charities across London that provide daily support to homeless people, but because only a few of them are well known, many struggle to secure the funding they need to carry out this vital work. We fund some amazing homelessness projects each year at a number of these smaller charities, targeting the money where it's needed most so it will have the biggest possible impact on the lives of homeless people. Using our knowledge and experience of the sector, we identify projects where we believe the funding (typically a grant of around £10,000) will make a real difference. This is only possible thanks to the generosity of our supporters. With your help, we can fund further projects in the coming year that will provide life-changing support to people who are homeless in London. Thank you for supporting Streets of London. (NB: If you'd like to receive an occasional update from Streets of London about how your donation has helped, please be sure to tick the right box so we can contact you!)",True,,,https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=HelpForHomelessVeterans&pageUrl=1&isTeam=true,,,,0

,,Shelter," We work to alleviate the distress caused by homelessness and bad housing by giving advice, information and advocacy to people in housing need, and by campaigning for lasting political change to end the housing crisis for good.   Shelter will help anyone with a housing problem, whether they are a home-owner struggling to pay their mortgage, a tenant in conflict with their landlord or a homeless person looking for a roof over their head. Our housing experts give advice and support by phone or email, or face-to-face at our network of housing aid centres and in county courts and outreach centres.   We also have specialist projects that provide long term support to people who are trying to escape bad housing and homelessness.   Shelter tackles the root causes of bad housing by lobbying government and local authorities for new laws and policies, and more investment, to improve the lives of homeless and badly housed people.  Our influential campaigns bring aspects of bad housing to the attention of the media and the public, who  help us fight for solutions.   Shelter believes that everybody needs a home in a place they can thrive.
