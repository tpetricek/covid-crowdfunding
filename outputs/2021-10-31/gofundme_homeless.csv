Unfortunately this had not happened by time we were to be out and we have had to move into our caravan and I thank god we had it. We are in a caravan park but it's an hour away from kids school and takes us 2 hours twice a day there and back costing alot of petrol as well  it's not ideal and a situation I do not want my children to be in especially with winter coming in. We need to get a private rent and council will then help with some of the rent but we do not have the deposit and first month rent to pay upfront and we are in need of purchasing some second hand furniture as not everything in the previous home was ours. I hate being in this situation but for my children I am in need of help. Thank you for all your support and taking time to read this.",False
