It is more important than ever that we work together to support one another. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund has launched to provide support to those most at need in our community. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund Right now many of us are understandably feeling anxious and vulnerable  but there are many among us that need immediate support in order to ensure that they can have access to food. Greenwich residents have a proud history of looking after one another - and never has this been more important than now. So I have been working with Greenwich Food Bank to create the Greenwich Food Bank Fund. As the borough faces one of its most important challenges in living memory  the Fund has been set up to ensure that those in need across the borough have access to the help they need. Please  even during this most difficult of times  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Greenwich. Please be assured that even the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference. Thank you for your generosity. FAQs Where will the funds go? The funds will go directly to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by the Greenwich Food Bank and delivered to food banks across the borough  from Blackheath to Eltham  Kidbrooke  Thamesmead and beyond. A full list of food bank locations is available at https://greenwich.foodbank.org.uk/locations/. If I donate will it go directly to those who need it? Yes  your donation will go directly to Greenwich Food Bank. Unlike some other platforms  GoFundMe does not charge a fundraising fee although it takes a small transaction fee. See https://www.gofundme.com/c/free-fundraising for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to. Will the money be spent in Greenwich? Yes. Is there anything else I can do? The most immediate need is to raise finance  so that purchasing can continue. However there is also a need to: (1) donate food where possible; and (2) create a team of delivery drivers as the Food Bank moves to a delivery model. If you are able to help with either of these  please email [email redacted].uk. Where can I find more information about Covid-19?

I’m married to john and have 5 beautiful children.   A few years ago john was working as a helicopter pilot. A career he had wanted since he was a child and absolutely adored.    But then he got sick. He struggled for a long time before doctors figured out he had several auto immune diseases all at once. He struggles every day with pain  sickness  and insomnia. He takes morphine every day and has done for years  with really debilitating side effects because the medical system can’t help him.   He was made redundant from his beloved job and eventually we lost our house to the bank as we couldn’t keep up with the mortgage. This is something he really struggles to accept. Since then we have gone from one disaster to another. We rent a house at the moment that the landlord wants us to move out so they can use it for something else but we have nowhere to go. The council can’t help us. No private landlord will help because john is not working and we cannot afford to get anywhere ourselves.     It’s really hard to watch our kids miss out on so much in their childhood. Some of them are too young to remember the amazing  fun  hardworking dad they had. Now they see him sick and weak and they see all the things they miss out on because we cannot afford it or because he is too ill to take part in it. It’s hard to hide our tears when we know there’s something they want but we can’t give it to them. Or hide our upset when we have to go to the food bank or sell some of our things to give them a birthday present or afford their homeschooling needs.   It’s very humbling to have to hold your hands up and admit you need help. For john to not be able to provide for his family is devastating. He is not able to admit we need help but I as a wife and mother know that humbling ourselves and asking for help is the only option left open to us.     Johns own doctors have told us about medication they believe will really help him and get him off the morphine. But they cannot prescribe this medication on the NHS and unfortunately we cannot afford to buy it privately. John was due to have an operation in January 2020 but it was postponed due to COViD and he is still waiting. He could get this operation in a matter of weeks privately but we cannot afford to pay for it. There are many things we could do to help him get better and get back to work but we cannot afford it. It’s extremely heartbreaking to know there is help right in front of us but we cannot take advantage of it because we don’t have enough money.     We have experienced people’s kindness throughout this process. We feel so ashamed that we have not been able to repay that kindness and to have to ask for more help but that’s exactly what I’m doing. I need my husband back. My kids need their father back and we need some stability in our lives again  we need a forever home.   If you could please help in anyway I would be so so grateful. You have no idea how much your help could change our lives. Please help me get my husband well again and not suffer so much everyday. Please me give my babies a forever home and a dad who is well enough to be the dad he always wanted to be.     Thank you for any help you can give and We would be so grateful for any prayers you could offer for our family. Xx    Edit:  Thank you all so much for your donations. It’s incredibly overwhelming to experience all your generosity and kindness. And thank you also to the people who have personally sent donations directly to us  Mavis & Chris and Marion O’Reilly.

Free Meals  Full Hearts is NOT designed to help the same families on a week in  week out basis. I created the group to support those who maybe too proud or embarrassed to reach out for help or go to a food bank. It was created for families who may have faced redundancy or who are struggling on furlough… it’s for those without a support network around them who needs a little short term support.    I have been overwhelmed with the support in the last 12 months. The newspaper articles and TV appearances has helped raise a huge amount of awareness. And I’m overwhelmingly flattered to have received my Pride of Britain AND Pride of Reading nominations- thank you to everyone who has voted!

Her brave efforts will help raise money for the AP Foundation ""Made in London"" bus project. Made in LONDON is a multi-media training and intervention project delivered into the community on board a purpose-built double-decker bus  to help disadvantaged young people  and those at risk of exclusion from school  out of education  employment or training and at risk of offending  to change their lives for the better and reduce anti-social behaviour. The bus will travel into the heart of the community so that we can attract those who need us most and working alongside local Youth Offending Teams  Pupil Referral Units  Social Services  Police  Schools and Community services  we will make a difference. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause  which means so much to us all. Anyone wishing to take part in the run or willing to offer support please contact www.apfoundation.co.uk Help us by sharing on social media. Thank you.   1. The bus will function as a radio station. They will travel to different areas of London/ UK with a different artist every month performing in that area. Radio broadcast will be on radio frequency  and online platforms (Youtube  Instagram  FB live etc) 2. When the bus is not being used as a radio station  it will be used by underprivileged youths as a recording studio  to record their potential music and accompanying videos. 3. Programs will be offered in music production and recording that teens can sign up to attend online before the actual recording offers to begin. 4. A competition for best recording and music video can be offered at the end of the month with either monetary or product giveaway from sponsors  plus the opportunity to perform live on the radio and exposure to the radio’s listeners. 5. As well as performances from artists bringing light to the cause  our APF mentors will also have their own podcast and talk show. They would take calls from underprivileged kids or gang members  other ex-offenders and the like and give real-life advice based on their experiences helping give mentorship not only on a one-to-one basis but also that can be accessed online for many others that may need the same advice. 6. On radio off days  the bus can be used as a traveling food bank to bring food from supermarket sell-by produce to people who need it the most. We can also provide cups of tea or coffee to those in need of a hot drink and some company to ease the loneliness the Covid lockdown has brought to many. Volunteers for this would be from the foundation as a rehabilitation project for ex-offenders to give back to the community.       ",False

Ian have ADHD what make his life more difficult as not many people understand him and saying that he's very naughty child what makes him often upset but really he's the sweetest child I ever met he have so much love inside his little heart he will give me hugs and kisses like no other child will do. Always when I'm sad or he see me crying he always gonna come to me hug me wipe my tears and said ""don't cry mummy i love you"" and this words makes me keep going and fighting everyday because I know I have my children to live for. Without them I would be probably dead right now. I was going thru deep depression and sometimes I feel like I don't deserve to be a mum as my children deserve everything what's the best for them and atm I can't give them much because I'm a bit financially struggling Im not able to afford anything and this kill me everyday special when they asking me if I can buy them something they really want. If I could back to work I would do it but atm that's not possible as my little one is just 3 months old and I don't have any family or much friends here. I wish I could back to Poland to my parents but I can't even afford to do my girls passports as everyday I'm trying to manage to get some food or stuff for kids . I love my kids so much from bottom of my heart and I could die for them if I will have to and I feel very bad and shy to ask for help but atm that's the only option I have so if you can help me even little bit I would really much appreciate it at this will let me finally live without stressing everyday that someone will knock to my door or i that my kids will have no food in the fridge. Thank you so much for reading and understanding my situation and for any help what will change my and my 4 little munchkins lifes for better ❤️ God bless you ❤️ ",False

I was born in Nigeria and moved to the UK in 2004 to study. I finished my Masters in 2014 and am currently living in the North West area of Merseyside. I have previously worked for Foodbank as a volunteer during the pandemic helping homeless people  migrants  and other vulnerable people.    Situation?    I have always worked and paid my living expenses when I had a student visa. However  because of the hostile environment policy and UK’s draconian immigration system  I do not have permission to work  and I have no recourse to public funds (NRPF)  meaning that I have no access to housing support and benefits. As a result  I have been couch surfing and relying on the kindness of friends to stop me from being street homeless. I am also struggling with prediabetes and need proper nutrition and diet to avoid my situation getting worse.    What’s the plan?    Because I cannot work due to my dispute with the Home Office  I am kindly asking for some financial support to help with my living needs while I await a decision on my application with the Home Office. Thank you for your generosity and kindness during this difficult phase in my life.",False

GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw Since We Care was launched as the UK's largest independent food bank and advice and support hub in Lewisham in 2014  we have always ensured that  during school holidays and Christmas  children and the hungry families they come from do not have to worry about putting food on the table. This half term  however  and over this coming Christmas  we truly need your help to feed the new wave of people and pets from across London who are in crisis and will be coming through our doors this winter at Kath's Place  50 Friendly Street  Deptford SE8 4DR.    But this October millions will lose £1040 through the cut to #UniversalCredit people many in low paid work & most already on the breadline not helped by the increasing high cost of rent & rising energy -transport costs .Can you imagine losing up to 20%plus of your monthly income? That is the reality for so many people in the present crisis. Rents are so high in our area that people in work do not have enough cash to pay the rent and  probably for the first time in their lives  are having to trade a visit to their local coffee shop for a visit to the We Care Food Bank and Food Pantry for help  advice  support and solidarity. Embarrased and even ashamed  but even more desperate and distraught that their kids are going hungry  mums tell us that they can go days without food  and  on average  it takes people at least a week of going hungry before they finally come through our doors and ask for help. We really do need your donation this Christmas GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw . Becasue we help everyone and anyone and do not focus on one particular group (such as refugees or the homeless) we get absolutely NO national or local government funding or any other type of funding.

It’s crazy how the pandemic we currently living in has caused all kinds of financial difficulties situations and families have had no choice but to turn to the food banks for help and assistance. I know that raising money will help the food bank buy essential food. It saddens me to see how the numbers have doubled as more people are being impacted by COVID-19 with job losses and furlough leaving families struggling to find money to buy enough food. We have all seen the headlines regarding school meals but it's easy to forget for a lot of these children that is the only balanced meal they will get. In the first six months of the pandemic  some food banks in the United Kingdom gave out a staggering 1.2 million emergency food parcels. That’s one food parcel every 13 seconds  and 2 600 of these went to children every day on average. I decided to walk 2021 km and hopefully get this achieved within 10 months. So if you see me walking please give me a cheer and some motivational comments. Every penny helps put food on the table and allowing families to try not stress financially or have to choose between food and heating. So please consider donating to a worthy cause.    So I'm looking for your support. Together we can make a difference.  ",False

That’s because the cost of purchasing the food their users need far exceeds their operating budget from donations.   But canned goods are not enough. says food banks like Margate Independent Foodbank desperately need financial donations too  for several reasons. The first is to pay running costs to run the operation. “There’s a whole infrastructure that’s required to make sure  beyond just receiving the donation  that food is safely processed and distributed into our community ” he says. Money is also a good donation option because the vast amount of food donations arrive between November and Christmas  and having cash on hand helps them buy food during the remaining months  since people are hungry year-round. It also helps them buy supplies to meet specific clients’ needs  such as culturally appropriate foods. In addition  food banks are able to look for discounts and purchase food at wholesale  which means they are able to get more out of that Pound than a person shopping retail probably could.   ",False

Due to massive demand and the end of the lease on our current Warehouse we are moving to a brand new home that will help us increase our capacity and speed up our operations  helping us to continue to put food donated by the community straight into the hands of those who need it.     This is an exciting chapter in Canterbury Food Bank’s history  and a brilliant opportunity for us to grow and change in response to new challenges. But it is also an expensive chapter; our previous premises were occupied on a peppercorn lease of £10 a month  so by paying the market rate for a suitable property our rental costs have been multiplied 133 times.

The charity is moving to another warehouse  specially converted to suit its needs  because the lease on its current premises has come to an end.    CFB had been paying a peppercorn rent of £10 a month for the old building  but will now have to pay market rate of £16 000 a year.     Its Raise the Rent campaign aims to cover the rental costs so that all other funds can be used to buy and deliver food. The new  bigger warehouse  near Whitstable  secures the future of CFB as a key charity in the district.     Demand in the past 12 months has at times more than trebled year-on-year and in December it provided enough food to make more than 10 000 meals.     The economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 crisis  and the uncertainty of Brexit  are the main reasons behind the spike.    The charity has signed a five-year lease on the 3 780 square foot  two storey warehouse  which will be used to store donations of food and as an office.     CFB chair Martin Ward said: “We’re pleased and relieved to have secured our long-term future at a time when our services have never seen such high demand.     “It has become clear over the past year that  even more than ever  a backstop is needed to help those who can not afford food.     “We are that backstop and it is our intention to remain so for as long as we are required.     “These are difficult times for many people and we ask the public to help us support those most in need.”    CFB provides emergency three-day food parcels to individuals and families in financial need across Canterbury  Whitstable  Herne Bay and surrounding villages.    It has donation baskets in all leading supermarkets including Sainsbury’s  Tesco  Asda and Morrisons  where people can leave dried or tinned food items. ",False

This support started when there was no halal food support in the local area of Sharrow and Netheredge and people were struggling to buy basic food for themselves. Due to a gap in the area and a desperate need TSY collaborated with few others to collectively reach out to the most vulnerable including single parents  elderly  self isolating and hardship such as loss of income. All our work is voluntary and since March kind donations from local community has assisted us in making sure no one struggled alone. We are running low on cash donations to purchase food to continue this vital support and are reaching out to anyone who can support us by using this link and donating whatever little they can towards the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank project. Due to the level of need and referrals coming in since the start of this halal foodbank  we have called it Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank to avoid any barriers to any non-muslim vulnerable that maybe in need of this support. We would be very grateful for your support towards this cause and request you to please share widely amongst your contacts. For further information on TSY and the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank please feel free to contact:- Nighat Basharat (Founding Director) on 07988033534/[email redacted]",False

player tattooed on his back if the fundraiser reaches £25 000 by Christmas Day  2021. The player in question will be the one who scores the first goal for Town after the target has been reached.     --    The Welcome Centre is a Huddersfield-based foodbank that provides basic essentials to people in need. Unfortunately  the COVID-19 crisis has seen demand for their services rise and donations fall. To help  and in the absence of matchday donations  the Huddersfield Town Supporters’ Association (HTSA) and other Fans For Foodbanks partners are asking people to donate what they can.     All donations  no matter how big or small  or greatly appreciated. Stay safe and keep the faith. ",False

Every week we take the money you have kindly donated to a cash and carry and buy  in bulk  what the four food banks we are working with have told us they desperately need. (See pics below). This is complemented by a weekly visit to the Felix Project where we load up with fresh fruit  veg  meat  eggs and cheese. All of this is delivered to community kitchens who cook up meals for those most in need in W10.    We are currently working with The Dalgarno Trust   Bay 20   The Space and The Tabernacle . All four of these charities provide meals  bags of shopping and many other support services to those experiencing food poverty in W10. Kensington and Chelsea boasts some of the highest net worth inhabitants but also has many pockets of severe deprivation – North Kensington is one of the deepest. A sobering fact to note is that 31.6% of children in this borough live in poverty.    Food banks we are working alongside unanimously concur that the demand for aid has tripled this year since the pandemic began. Help is needed more than ever. Every time we make a drop  the relief and joy the charities express is palpable and sums up how desperate the situation is.    All the money donated will be used to supply fruit  veg and essentials to those in need in North Kensington. Your financial donations will go entirely towards funding this food relief project. All staff  including Rima  Amanda  Maryam and the admin  safeguarding and marketing support team are volunteers.     Please share this page with anyone who might be interested in helping and please donate if you would like to help. A regular donation would make a huge difference  as food poverty is not going to go away.    Thank you for your invaluable support.    Rima  Maryam  Amanda and team.    How to contact us:  Email: [email redacted]  Instagram: stjohnscafe    Call Rima: 07891 078 647    Or Amanda 07956 282 858    How it started: In March when the pandemic closed the doors of Rima’s Café at the Playground Theatre  she and her son Mars created a GoFundMe page to raise money for a Covid19 food relief campaign. Over the course of 11 weeks  they raised £16 000. With the help of a team of local volunteers producing over 6000 meals  all of which were delivered to those most in need in the North Ken community.     The last campaign attracted a lot of attention with publicity in newspapers both local and national  RBK&C Mayor Gerard Hargreaves came to visit and recently in October this year Rima was on Radio 5 Live discussing food poverty and school meals.

KEEP THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AS SAFE FROM CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) AS OTHERS.    Every moment matters. As the virus spreads in the UK  people living in poverty are among the most vulnerable to the worst outcomes of the virus  because they:      - Can’t afford basic hygiene essentials like hand wash  soap and hand sanitiser that will help protect them from infection.    - Can’t afford to stockpile essential everyday items    - Rely on food banks for their basic hygiene essentials  and due to public stockpiling  food banks’ supplies are dwindling fast     - Live or stay in crowded environments like homeless shelters  refuges and safe-houses    - Live in densely populated areas    - Work in low-income jobs in highly populated public spaces    - Don’t have a home to live in    Beauty Banks  the people-powered movement that supports people living in hygiene poverty in the UK has joined (virtual) hands with crowd-funding platform  GoFundMe to support those who can’t afford to take extra precautions to help keep them safe from what has been labelled ‘the worst public health crisis for a generation’  coronavirus (COVID-19).    Your support will help us to provide emergency hygiene parcels that will help protect those at higher risk and more vulnerable to being infected by the virus.

The Project /Building Purley Masjid​    Purley Masjid is a modern Islamic community centre in a suburb of South London  Purley. It was established in 2015 after fund raising to accommodate the needs of the local Muslim community.    Ma Sha’ Allah  the Masjid is now trying to cope with the demand and has to overcome many challenges to support the Muslim and also non-Muslim community. Here are just a few of examples of the issues:     We have one main hall which accommodates only 200 people for an average Jumu’ah congregation of over 400.      People often have to wait outside in the forecourt for the second Jamaat     Current facilities for ladies accommodates around 30  whereas the demand is known to be in excess of 150. This is severely restricting our ability to meet current demand for women     Our lectures  Fitness Classes  Mother and Toddlers group  daily iftaris in Ramadhan and seniors meet up sessions all take place on the same carpeted area on which we pray. This is not ideal and as we are effectively operating out of one hall  it means that we can only have one activity happening at any given time     The Food Bank only has enough space for a shelf rack to store food. It caters for anyone in need in the Purley community  Muslim and non-Muslim alike        By the Grace of Allah swt we have embarked on the Building Purley Masjid project that will cater for the needs of the community. The project will result in a new Masjid on the current Purley Masjid site and will be a modern  purpose built building for the community spanning 6 floors that will include:     Two male prayer halls with a combined capacity of 500     A ladies prayer hall with capacity of over 200 and crèche facilities      A multi purpose hall     A dedicated lecture/events hall (we held over 100 last year)  which can accommodate 100 people     Improved facilities for our already existing Youth Activities  Mother and Toddlers Group and Seniors Group     Separate classrooms for our Madrasah classes      More space for our weekly Food Bank  ​​    We already have all these activities running at Purley Masjid but are struggling to meet demands and keep up the excellent level of service we provide.",False

Update: 3rd March  2021    Another interview with The Independent  describing the struggle to survive on Universal Credit and my fears about the cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/budget/budget-universal-credit-20-pounds-b1811750.htmlTaking this opportunity to thank everyone for their ongoing support - you are wonderful and I couldn't do this without you.   .  .  .      Update: 19th January  2021 I've been interviewed by The Independent about the catastrophic consequences of the upcoming Universal Credit cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/b1789040.html      .  .  .        My original message: 30th August  2019    This is incredibly difficult for me to write  but I need to ask my friends  acquaintances and perhaps even some people whom I don’t know  to help me get through the next few months.    I am a domestic abusive survivor struggling to meet essential living costs and the situation is going to escalate rapidly because my employer is deducting more than 25% of my pay from September onwards  to recover two overpayments they made in error for a really long time  without me or payroll noticing.    I’m already on a low income and have been trying to find a more stable job. Until now I’ve been working two jobs  but the temporary one is coming to an end and I will only have my permanent part-time job – where they have persistently tried to dismiss me on health grounds so aside from the overpayment recovery  I just can’t hold on there for much longer.    Whenever I do give my notice or get dismissed  they’ll take the entirety of my final month’s pay.    I live alone but the person I used to cohabit with left substantial utility bill debts at our home that I didn’t become aware of until later  since they lied about having cleared balances. There’s not enough space to move another person in  and I can’t move out right now for financial and contractual reasons.    Because of an active police investigation for rape and domestic abuse that I can’t go into  I’ve already borrowed money for unexpected costs like home security  numerous phone calls to charities and agencies offering professional advice  and private therapy which unfortunately I had to quit.    My chronically poor health has dramatically worsened – I’ve been to a&e twice in the past fortnight because of a kidney infection that didn’t respond to treatment and I had to pawn things to pay for my ongoing prescriptions  but there’s not much of value left for me to sell.    I need to wear glasses but have been doing without for several months since they broke; I’m doing without a lot of things. One of my cats needs dental surgery soon but this isn’t going to be possible.    I earn slightly too much to claim benefits or get free prescriptions and despite years of hospital referrals  I am still fighting for a diagnosis to explain my physical health problems so I’m not currently eligible for any support that could be claimed.    Unfortunately I’m estranged from my parents and I don’t have regular contact with any other family.    I don’t have savings and I wouldn’t realistically be able to repay any further money borrowed.    Up to this point I’ve managed to keep on top of the rent and buy cat food but I have now begun going without my own food  even before overpayment recovery has started. I’m hoping to access a food bank next week but the period I can use them for will be limited.    It’s hard to put a figure on how much help I should ask for  since the only real solution is me finding a job where they’re not actively trying to dismiss me for my chronic health problems  but I am hopeful that if I can just get straight with the money I already owe and raise a couple of months’ living expenses to buy myself time whilst finding a better job  then I can make things work.    Thank you for reading this far; I am extremely grateful to anyone who can donate or share this page. I don’t have many followers and would really appreciate people making this fundraiser more visible. ",False

We are continuing to support these families in term time and the holidays.     £50 raised will be able to feed 25 young people    £100 raised will be able to feed 50 young people    £1000 raised will be able to feed 500 young people     There is power in our community. Join us.        Food provision through schools and youth clubs play an essential role in providing food for children and families who are in need of it - this is especially true during the holidays  when Free School Meals (FSM) are not usually available. Recently  the government (after several U-turns) decided to extend funding for FSM over the school holidays  but several families received substandard food packages that still forced them to rely on extra aid from food banks and mutual aid community groups.    Many young people are also not entitled to free school meals during term time because their parents earn above the amount allowed for eligibility for free school meals. In England  earnings from employment must be less than £16 190 for families in receipt of Child Tax or Working Tax Credits  and only £7 400 per year for families in receipt of Universal Credit.     This is staggeringly low and  when combined with measures such as the two child limit on Universal Credit payments  means that many families struggling to put food on the table are nevertheless deemed ineligible for free school meals. Other families are unable to claim FSM for their children because they have no recourse to public funds (NPRF) which is a condition the government imposes on some families due to their immigration status.      What does this mean?    Those recently impacted by the financial costs of COVID-19 (which are only increasing)  are more likely to go hungry. This will have bothphysiological and psychological impacts on young people and their families.     Why?    The data collected by CPAG on child poverty in the UK are enraging: 4.2 million children were living in poverty in the UK in 2018-19  out of which 700 000 were in London. This has been worsened by the fact that parents and carers are twice as likely to lose their jobs due to the pandemic.     In Lewisham  according to Trust for London   37% of children are in a situation of food insecurity  and 14% of the population needs social benefits to survive. It's deeply distressing that this level of inequality exists in the UK  particularly given that we are one of the richest countries in the world.     Don’t know what living with food insecurity feels like? See here .    The figures above reflect the shocking inequality in Britain  which was already severely impacting children and young people before the worst financial effects caused by the pandemic began to be felt. Due to the government’s lackluster response to the pandemic  it is projected that the number of children in poverty will increase to 5.2 million by 2022.     We also cannot ignore that this impact has not been distributed equally: people coming from Communities of Colour and immigrant background are over twice as likely to live in hardship than their white British counterparts and  due to the wider structural racial injustices  these communities are also disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. We are certainly not 'all in this together'.      What are we doing about it?     Legendary Community Club  which was named by Chevrington Odoh from the Pro Plus FC   is a grassroots project set up by some members of Lewisham Mutual Aid in partnership with local organisations. Our aim is to deliver emergency food provision to ensure that young people do not go without out  for as long as there is a need.       We will make this happen in three ways:    1. Temporary food provisions have been set-up for families who require this support  in partnership with local schools and community groups.    2. A kitchen has been set up to prepare nutritionally balanced meals for young people through their youth clubs which run after school and in the school holidays.    We know that food charity is not a long term solution. This is not the world we want to live in and we refuse to normalise food banks as a solution to food poverty. This is NOT an inevitable situation.    3. With this in mind  we will continue to work alongside The Children's Society  who have been calling on the government to ensure that every local council adequately funds emergency support for families   so that nobody is left behind in a time of crisis. For more information about their campaign 'Strengthening the Safety Net' see here   and sign the petition here.    We will also continue to support the calls from Save the Children and Child Poverty Action Group who have been lobbying for reforms to the benefits system  as well as an increase in the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit by £20  and an end to the two child limit and the £20 000 a year benefit cap which hits families in high-rent areas such as Lewisham particularly hard. Lastly  we will continue to support IFAN with the #CashFirst campaign  which has already inspired us to start our very own community-led participatory research project (stay tuned for more on this!).     The way our tax and welfare system is designed is a political choice. There are solutions . We will call on the government and its representatives to be bold  brave and radical in how they approach this problem.       What will we use the funds for?      We will use the money raised from the community to buy food and equipment for the project.    We have a host of volunteers  and multiple clubs and schools signed up and ready to go. The project began on July 21st 2020.       £50 raised will be able to feed 45 children     £100 raised will be able to feed 90 children     £1000 raised will be able to feed 909 children       There is power in our community.
