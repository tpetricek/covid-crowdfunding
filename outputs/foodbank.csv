Runnymede Foodbank is part of a UK-wide network of Trussell Trust food banks providing emergency food to people in crisis nationwide.
We cover Runnymede district and the surrounding area to provide a minimum of three days emergency food and support to people experiencing crisis. 
We aim to help people in a crisis by providing food, emotional support and signposting to other services as appropriate, and in doing so, help the person or family deal with the situation they are in more effectively. 
People are referred to Runnymede Foodbank by the agencies working with people in need. This could be Social Workers, Health Visitors, GP’s, Schools, Citizen Advice Bureau and many of the voluntary organisations working in the area. The food (all long life) is generously donated by local people at supermarket collections, Churches, schools and local businesses. 
We serve people of all faith groups and beliefs or none. We are passionate about inclusion and being non-judgemental is central to what we do. We believe that everyone has the right to have food on their plate, dignity and hope for the future. 
The Foodbank would not be able to function without a fabulous team of volunteers who sort the stock, provide a welcoming face to those in need and take part in supermarket collections and other community events.","Beacon Church,95-99 Guildford Street  Chertsey,  KT16 9AS",18/03/2020,19/04/2020

Bow Foodbank is a small independent foodbank based in Bow, east London. Our mission is to provide food and support to anyone in need.
We are fairly unique in our approach: the dignity of each client is foremost, they choose the food they need, and we don't require clients to be referred or have vouchers, prefering to trust each client. 

We provide a warm welcome, tea and a sandwich/cake while clients wait to do their 'shopping'. Free legal advice is available at each foodbank session.

We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year.
