,"11 Bedford Road,  London,  W4 1JD","Duchenne UK","Two families a week in the UK are told that their child has Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a devastating muscle wasting disease. We are an ambitious highly focused charity, investing millions of pounds in research right now to find treatments and a cure and to help this generation. The charity has been formed by the coming together of Joining Jack and Duchenne Children's Trust, the two biggest funders of research in the UK in the last three years.  We are committed to continuing to drive momentum to deliver treatments to help this generation of those with DMD. Please visit our website at www.duchenneuk.org. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a desperately cruel muscle wasting disease that mainly affects boys. It’s the most common fatal genetic disease to affect children. It is 100% fatal and boys die in their early 20s. There are no treatments and no cure. But thanks to recent breakthroughs and with your help, we can save them. There are lots of ways up can help us. Make a donation on this page, create your own event, or visit the campaigns and events sections to find out about our latest events - and then please join us. Join us at an event: We often have charity places available for fundraisers, check out our fundraising event page.

Our goal is to help people live well until they die and support those affected by the loss of a loved one.

We were founded in 1967 by Dame Cicely Saunders and, 50 years later, her words still remain at the heart of everything we do: “You matter because you are you and you matter until the last moment of your life.”   As a registered charity we need to raise £16 million every year to continue to care for people when it matters most.

Each year the UK generates 1.9 million tonnes of food waste that could have been eaten, which is worth around £4.6bn, At the same time, 2 million people in the UK cannot afford to eat regularly, and in London 70,000 children go to school hungry each day. For every £1 donated, the Felix Project saves £4 of food. Our operation is simple, reliable and efficient. We have a small team of staff and over 400 volunteers who drive, walk and cycle to collect food from suppliers and deliver it to around 200 charities and schools.

The vouchers are issued by local agencies who can also provide long term support, if needed, to help address some of the issues behind a client’s crisis. Sadly, demand is only increasing. In 2019 we gave 2,885 individuals a week’s emergency food supplies. 1,072 of that number, approximately 40%, were children.

EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by one full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.   EFP operates 7 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme. Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances. Each food pack provides at least three meals for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave). In 2018-19, we provided 11,495 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 19.6% increase on the previous year. We were able to do so by receiving 130,000kg of food from public donations. Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps. Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres.  Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.

We don’t think anyone in our community should have to face going hungry. That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis.

Working closely with established and trusted organisations, schools and hospitals on the ground in Nepal, CHANCE for NEPAL gives aid and support for children and their families as well as educational and training opportunities.  We sponsor and support projects in Nepal relating to: HEALTH-EDUCATION-STREET-CHILDREN-VOCATIONAL TRAINING - RABIES PREVENTION Our medical support in Nepal focuses on the burns units of two hospitals, the Kanti Children's Hospital and the Trauma Hospital both in Kathmandu. We fund weekly nutritional food baskets for each patient coming to the burns unit, as well physiotherapy and counselling 5 times per week. Every child coming on to the Burns Unit receives a 'Goody Bags' containing fun things to do to keep them amused.  We fund up to 40 skin graft operatons a year in these two hospitals. Our support at the Kanti started in 2004.  We support Mountain Heart Nepal  who deploy medical teams in times of crisis - earthquake/flood, by funding medicines for the health camp as well as funding a 'Magic Read' programme where children receive a text book covering health related information targeted at their age.  We support Papa's Children's Home for 25 children who either have no parents or a parent who can no longer take care of their child. Our support is to fund all the food costs for this home as well as a monthly activitity prrogramme. Our support at Papa's Children's Home started in 2012.   We fund a milk programme and a 'Tiffin"" meal in three schools. Our support in schools started in 2006. We support WCS (Women's Cooperative Society) with skills training. Over 160 women receive elementary and advanced training in how to grow seasonal vegetables. We fund 5 trainings per year. This empowers women to earn a good income by taking out a small loan with WCS, attending the 4 day training, then growing and selling their vegetables at market, thus enabling them to educate one or more of their children. Our support with WCS started in 2005.   We fund up to 1000 rabies vaccinations through Sneha's Care in Kathmandu and fund leaflets and posters to be used in schools and villages to educate children and adults about the dangers of rabies. Our support fighting rabies started in 2005. CHANCE for Nepal has set up an educational sponsorship programme at three schools in Kathmandu where 37 students are being sponsored for their education, in schools, colleges and University by English sponsors.  We have funded the building of 5 schools and 2 health posts in remote areas in Western Nepal. All our projects are regularly monitored by Westerners living and working in Nepal.

Our Aims are:  - to raise awareness of testicular cancer and the importance for men to check themselves regularly as early diagnosis is essential.  - to support testicular cancer patients and their families in East Anglia. - to raise funds to enable these aims.   - to work with other testicular cancer charities across the country as part of the Testicular Cancer Network to impact National Campaigns around education and awareness. Signs and symptoms of testicular cancer and how to check themselves should be something all men know. A simple monthly check is all it takes, and it could be life-saving. We visit schools, colleges, universities and places of work to raise awareness amongst students and staff. We encourage all men to get into the routine of regular self examination throughout their life.   To enable us to achieve our primary aims of Awareness and Support, we need to fundraise, and fundraising events in themselves also help to promote awareness of testicular cancer, and the work of It's On The Ball.   We are always grateful for any donation no matter how small. As a fundraiser you will be making someone's journey through testicular cancer more comfortable and supported, as well as funding our awareness campaigns which provide men and boys with the information they need to get an earlier diagnosis, and potentially saving lives - on their behalf, many thanks!

,"11 Bedford Road,  London,  W4 1JD","Duchenne UK","Two families a week in the UK are told that their child has Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a devastating muscle wasting disease. We are an ambitious highly focused charity, investing millions of pounds in research right now to find treatments and a cure and to help this generation. The charity has been formed by the coming together of Joining Jack and Duchenne Children's Trust, the two biggest funders of research in the UK in the last three years.  We are committed to continuing to drive momentum to deliver treatments to help this generation of those with DMD. Please visit our website at www.duchenneuk.org. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a desperately cruel muscle wasting disease that mainly affects boys. It’s the most common fatal genetic disease to affect children. It is 100% fatal and boys die in their early 20s. There are no treatments and no cure. But thanks to recent breakthroughs and with your help, we can save them. There are lots of ways up can help us. Make a donation on this page, create your own event, or visit the campaigns and events sections to find out about our latest events - and then please join us. Join us at an event: We often have charity places available for fundraisers, check out our fundraising event page.   Every year we run the The Duchenne Dash, our own annual exciting and exhausting 24-hour cycle ride from London to Paris, which over the past 6 years has raised over £3,500,000!! Please contact events@duchenneuk.org if you are interested in taking a place in any of these events, or want to find out more. Thank you everyone for your continued and much-needed support.

,"King Street House,15 Upper King Street  Norwich,  NR3 1RB","It's On The Ball - Testicular Cancer Charity","It's On The Ball is a registered charity (Charity No. 1155510) based in Norwich.  Our Aims are:  - to raise awareness of testicular cancer and the importance for men to check themselves regularly as early diagnosis is essential.  - to support testicular cancer patients and their families in East Anglia. - to raise funds to enable these aims.   - to work with other testicular cancer charities across the country as part of the Testicular Cancer Network to impact National Campaigns around education and awareness. Signs and symptoms of testicular cancer and how to check themselves should be something all men know. A simple monthly check is all it takes, and it could be life-saving. We visit schools, colleges, universities and places of work to raise awareness amongst students and staff. We encourage all men to get into the routine of regular self examination throughout their life.   To enable us to achieve our primary aims of Awareness and Support, we need to fundraise, and fundraising events in themselves also help to promote awareness of testicular cancer, and the work of It's On The Ball.   We are always grateful for any donation no matter how small.

This was a major challenge undertaken in unprecedented circumstances, achieved through hard work, collaboration and decisive action. Now, our priority is to secure Project Trust's future. The costs of repatriation and some of the extraordinary lengths to which we went to secure the safe return of our young people, combined with uncertainty due to the impact of the Coronavirus, is significantly impacting on our work.  Project Trust’s future is threatened and we need your help. We are appealing to the whole Project Trust Family for all the support and donations you can give. Your Best Year  Project Trust is in it's 53rd year, which in itself is impressive. But our real successes lie in the impact on the overseas Communities in which our Volunteers live and work, the personal development of Volunteers, and the many ways in which Returned Volunteers have then applied their experiences to everyday life. Society has never needed globally-aware young people with an empathy and understanding for cultures and peoples more than it does right now. Safeguarding Project Trust’s future together will allow future generations of young people to experience unique overseas opportunities we have offered across 67 countries since 1967. That is why doing Project Trust is an adventure like no other. And that is why we know how much you care about Project Trust and how much you, whether as a Volunteer, Parent or Friend value the experiences on offer.   With that in mind, please give generously.

EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by one full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.   EFP operates 7 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme. Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances. Each food pack provides at least three meals for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave). In 2018-19, we provided 11,495 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 19.6% increase on the previous year. We were able to do so by receiving 130,000kg of food from public donations. Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps. Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres.  Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.

,"Corner House,Barrack Road  Exeter,  EX2 5DW","Force Cancer Charity"," FORCE Cancer Charity is based in Exeter. FORCE (Friends of the Oncology and Radiotherapy Centre, Exeter) believes that anyone affected by cancer deserves the best possible treatment and professional support, close to home and face-to-face. Since 1987 the charity has been funding local research and buying equipment to improve patient care at the Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital. In 2004 FORCE opened a Cancer Support and Information Centre in the grounds of the RD&E. The Centre is open every weekday 9:30-4:30 (Wednesdays 6:30), except Bank Holidays, for people needing physical, emotional, psychological and practical support at a difficult time in their lives. The Centre receives around 25,000 visits a year with patients, their families, carers and friends all able to access support. It has a well-stocked library and information nurses are always on hand to help with questions and offer advice. There are counselling services for individuals and within support groups, including for children and young people, plus complementary therapies, exercise guidance, relaxation and mindfulness sessions, a benefits advice service, help to cope with hair loss and a wig fitting service. FORCE also offers support and information sessions once a week in Okehampton, Tiverton and Honiton. The charity also funds the delivery of chemotherapy in all three towns.  All of FORCE’s services are free of charge. Since the charity was founded it has spent well over £8million on support, equipment and research. FORCE receives no Government or NHS funding. FORCE needs to raise £1.7million every year to maintain the services it offers. That money comes entirely from voluntary contributions - legacies, donations, the FORCE charity shop and from fundraising events. Fantastic support from the community it serves enables FORCE to fulfil its mission to support anyone locally affected by cancer.

Today, VICTA works hard to involve children and young people who are blind or partially sighted so they are able to make a difference to their own lives. www.victa.org.uk",True,2020-01-23,"2020-02-01 15/2020-01-31 15/2020-01-29 15/2020-01-29 15/2020-01-29 20/2020-01-23 10/2020-01-23 10",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=LauraBanks6&pageUrl=1,2020-02-01,"Leeds City",,100

We distribute crisis food parcels across Southend and Rochford, to people referred to us because they are struggling to put food on their table. After our busiest year ever in 2019, 2020 is already our most challenging.   We are currently facing several challenges responding to coronavirus, including: fewer places open for donations and substantially less food being donated; restrictions on how many volunteers can be active in our spaces, which is stretching our capacity especially as there has been an increased numbers of enquiries; uncertainty about how much local need might suddenly increase; and changes to the way we organise distribution to keep everyone safe. Check our covid-19 page for current arrangements. If you are are able to donate money or get sponsored to do something amazing through #TwoPointSixChallenge the funds you raise could be used to buy food and make sure we can keep supporting people in our community. Just like a real shopping basket, when you join in a crowdfunder every can counts and it all adds up! Even if you can't donate right now, you can still support the foodbank for free.

Last year we helped 1209 different households locally, providing 5218 3-day emergency food supplies in crisis. This is an increase of 11% on the previous year. We partner with Citizen's Advice Wandsworth and have a full-time advisor working exclusively with people in the foodbank, helping to resolve the crisis and reduce the need for future food bank use.

"Welfare support to ex RAF Cranwell Apprentices","Unit 12 New Lairdship Yards,Broomhouse Road  Edinburgh,Midlothian  EH11 3UY","Edinburgh Food Project","Edinburgh Food Project (EFP) are a local independant charity (SC043220) and are a member of, but are not funded by, the Trussell Trust network. EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by one full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.   EFP operates 7 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme. Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances. Each food pack provides at least three meals for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave). In 2018-19, we provided 11,495 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 19.6% increase on the previous year. We were able to do so by receiving 130,000kg of food from public donations. Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps. Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres.  Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.

People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances. Each food pack provides at least three meals for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave). In 2018-19, we provided 11,495 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 19.6% increase on the previous year. We were able to do so by receiving 130,000kg of food from public donations. Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps. Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres.  Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.

West Lothian Food bank is a Trussell Trust food bank which provides a minimum of three days emergency food and support to people experiencing crisis.

"Advancement of education generally and in particular of any educational establishment in the United Kingdom and Israel.","102 Station Road,  Harpenden,Hertfordshire  AL5 4TU","Harpenden Spotlight On Africa","We are a development charity run by a small team of diverse and enthusiastic volunteers in Hertfordshire. We operate through our sister organisation, Spotlight on Africa-Uganda Foundation which is run by Ugandans. We serve an impoverished community in the sub-county of Bukasakya near the town of Mbale, in Eastern Uganda. Bukasakya is a slum area of around 30,000 people. Because we are all volunteers in the UK, at least 95p in the pound goes out to Uganda. That's worth £1.20 with Gift Aid. Every penny you donate goes a very long way.  We believe that the most effective way of lifting a community out of poverty is to address their basic needs in an integrated way and with active local involvement. That is why we focus on four key areas: education, clean water, health and economic development. This is not a common model but one that is regarded highly by the local government officials and community leaders whom we meet during our visits. When we started in 2006 there were some 60 students at our school in Musoto (a slum village in Bukasakya sub-county). Today we are educating close to 1,000 students. We’ve had 100% pass rate in the primary leaving examinations for the last 3 years and it is now the best performing school in the sub-county.  In 2006, water-coverage in the area was 25%. Today it is 80%  because we have drilled 24 new boreholes and water springs to provide clean water.  In the absence of organised healthcare we’ve funded a government based ‘Village Health Team’ (VHT) programme and have trained more than 250 men and women to give practical health advice to their villages on everything from hand washing to malaria control and HIV/Aids. They are one of the most active VHT in the Mbale District. A tangible outcome of these two initiatives is that there have been no deaths from cholera in the sub-county over the last few years. Our efforts on health and sanitation in the area were recognised (along with the likes of World Vision and Malaria Consortium) in a UN sponsored report on VHTs in Uganda. We've set up economic development schemes to give communities a means of generating income. We've established a fish farm that generates money and provides a source of food, donated 50 goats to widows and orphans that have provided milk, fertiliser and produce to sell at the local market.
