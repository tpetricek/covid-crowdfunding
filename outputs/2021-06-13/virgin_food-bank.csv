Each person is unique and we tailor our care to meet social, emotional and spiritual needs, as well as manage physical symptoms. Our goal is to help people live well until they die and support those affected by the loss of a loved one. Every year we provide care and support to over 6,000 people across South East London, both at home and in the hospice.   We passionately believe that everyone should have access to the best care at the end of their lives and have an extensive education programme, working with people across the world, to improve and develop hospice care.   We were founded in 1967 by Dame Cicely Saunders and, 50 years later, her words still remain at the heart of everything we do: “You matter because you are you and you matter until the last moment of your life.”   As a registered charity we need to raise £16 million every year to continue to care for people when it matters most. Without the support of our local communities this wouldn’t be possible.

The Osmani Trust was created following the merger in 2009 of Elite Youth (1973) and Brick Lane Youth Development Association (1989).  Barriers to housing are in the top 2% most deprived. This is closely followed by low income at 9% and living environment 12% most deprived. Tower Hamlets sees some of the highest paid jobs alongside the highest levels of child povertydue to social exclusion and material deprivation. We know that children living in poverty experience more disadvantage and suffer poorer health and die younger. Crime deprivation falls within the top 40%of most deprived areas nationally; 66% of female inmates and 59% of male inmates have dependants under the age of 18 in Tower Hamlets. The number of displaced children with a parent in prison increases the vulnerability and risk of young people being attracted to joining a gang and a life of crime as this is what they feel will provide them with a sense of belonging and togetherness.  Employment barriers lie at 28% most deprived and educational deprivation lies at 33%, many of our young people report that they do not have the space at home to study due to overcrowding and thus reach lower levels of educational attainment. The impact of this can lead to them either becoming victims or perpetrators of crime, which results in them having lower paid jobs. Health barriers lie at a striking 26% most deprived, with a high number of families caring for disabled members they are more likely to remain in poverty, due to the high costs of caring.

In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year. That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK. If you'd like more information or have any questions about fundraising please don't hesitate to contact us.

Crime deprivation falls within the top 40%of most deprived areas nationally; 66% of female inmates and 59% of male inmates have dependants under the age of 18 in Tower Hamlets. The number of displaced children with a parent in prison increases the vulnerability and risk of young people being attracted to joining a gang and a life of crime as this is what they feel will provide them with a sense of belonging and togetherness.  Employment barriers lie at 28% most deprived and educational deprivation lies at 33%, many of our young people report that they do not have the space at home to study due to overcrowding and thus reach lower levels of educational attainment. The impact of this can lead to them either becoming victims or perpetrators of crime, which results in them having lower paid jobs. Health barriers lie at a striking 26% most deprived, with a high number of families caring for disabled members they are more likely to remain in poverty, due to the high costs of caring. Especially as larger families are at a significantly higher risk of poverty. We have the 8th highest rate of Sexually Transmitted Infections in the country.  With so many challenges there is no surprise that our workers report that young people are struggling to strive and succeed in finding, gaining and sustaining employment. They struggle to make healthy and informed choices about their future. Our projects aim to help them break the cycle of crime and injustice they face due to the deprivation they live in and help them to lead extraordinary lives.

,"Hebridean Centre,  Isle of Coll,Argyll and Bute  PA78 6TE","Project Trust","Urgent Appeal  Coronavirus is having a massive impact on all aspects of our lives - and as a charity, Project Trust is no exception.  Our first response and priority was to urgently repatriate our 2019/20 Volunteers. This was a major challenge undertaken in unprecedented circumstances, achieved through hard work, collaboration and decisive action. Now, our priority is to secure Project Trust's future. The costs of repatriation and some of the extraordinary lengths to which we went to secure the safe return of our young people, combined with uncertainty due to the impact of the Coronavirus, is significantly impacting on our work.  Project Trust’s future is threatened and we need your help. We are appealing to the whole Project Trust Family for all the support and donations you can give. Your Best Year  Project Trust is in it's 53rd year, which in itself is impressive. But our real successes lie in the impact on the overseas Communities in which our Volunteers live and work, the personal development of Volunteers, and the many ways in which Returned Volunteers have then applied their experiences to everyday life. Society has never needed globally-aware young people with an empathy and understanding for cultures and peoples more than it does right now. Safeguarding Project Trust’s future together will allow future generations of young people to experience unique overseas opportunities we have offered across 67 countries since 1967. That is why doing Project Trust is an adventure like no other.

He endured several months of total blindness and he learned how to cope in his dark world.  This equipped him with new and different strategies with which to face life. Tony had been a very successful business man prior to his trauma and was a great believer in the power of the marketing and networking tools. Having lost the use of 50% of his body Tony never allowed the disability to constrain his desire to continue to network and support, encourage and help others. Tony made often made friends of those who found friendship a struggle.  He understood what it was to have your confidence shattered and your world shrink through trauma.

In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year. That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger.
