The explicit aim of this policy is to 'incentivize' unemployed people into work [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37873922]. It is ideologically motivated, responding to the myth that being on benefits is a lifestyle choice, and will disproportionately affect single mothers and larger families as a result [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/families-set-to-lose-100-a-week-under-chilling-new-benefit-cap-theresa-may-george-osborne-a7401681.html]. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, savings made from this measure are likely to be offset by emergency hardship payments made to those struggling to pay their rent [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/07/new-cap-on-benefit-payments-will-only-result-in-trivial-savings/].</p><p><span>My day of willingly foregoing food is nothing compared to the food insecurity and poverty that thousands of people are forced to undergo on a regular basis. The benefits cap will erode the physical and mental health of individuals and families, including those who are already suffering, and represents a shocking assault on human dignity. Clearly, food banks are not a whole solution to this issue.

We say this because it’s not right that anyone cannot afford their own food. That’s why we are working towards a just, compassionate future, where no one should have to use a food bank to get by.

Our vision is ambitious, but we know that if we work together it is possible. We can create a future where nobody goes hungry, because nobody will allow it – when we work Together for Change.

Of this number 1,424 went to children.

The 6+ week waiting period for a first payment can contribute to debt, mental health issues and rent arrears. The effects of these can last even after people receive their Universal Credit payments, as bills and debts pile up.

Every week people are referred to us after being hit by something unavoidable – such as illness, a delay in a benefit payment or an unexpected bill – means food is simply unaffordable. It really is only with the community’s support that we’re able to provide vital emergency help when it matters most, and we hope that one day there will be no need for us in Hamilton District. But until that day comes, we will continue to offer the best possible service to help local people facing a crisis. Thank you so much to everyone in Hamilton District who already donates time, food and money to help local people.

,,,1110522,"The Trussell Trust",False,2020-04-11,"<p><span>At the start of the year Dan Tilke and I decided to set up a company called HAFU which we intended to open after I completed my training at Le Manior aux quat saison. The fundamental idea of the business is to provide healthy affordable food in the takeaway market were the fundamentals of cooking, seasonality and wonderful flavours would be at the for front of everything we do. Transferring the the skills I have learnt and will continue to learn from the incredible chefs I work alongside at Le Manior. Chef Gary Jones told me during my interview at Le Manior that food has the power to create happiness and escape from the world we face, which I've been told from my incredible customers my food has been doing for them. Pursuing my dream of becoming a chef has for the last 18 months of my life has been integral to every life decision I have made and this in turn has given me such incredible happiness, friends and experiences which I'm truly grateful for.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>However, In a turn of events three weeks ago when the country entered lock down, I like so many other chefs had the daunting news that we were no longer were allowed to go into work. This lead to huge worries as I was working on a zero hour contract at Le Manior, the fear I was no longer going to have any stream of income over the next few months hit home hard. So after lengthy discussion with my parents &nbsp;in the car journey home from celebrating my mothers retirement at Le Manior. The decision was made to start cooking meals for local people in Compton Dando and the surrounding villages to raise some money to cover my essential bills. Over the last three weeks we have been incredibly busy, serving food on 16 of the 21 days of lockdown and selling over 400 meals out of two ovens and 5 burners stove. However, through the incredible generosity of Belmond and the team at Le Manior I have retained 100% of my wage which has meant this money I had been earning was no longer needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, Like everyone else I have been watching the news every day for updates on the corona virus crisis and one story stood out in particular and that was of the massive rise of need for food banks and the decrease in funding and donations.This lead to phoning up the local food bank in Keynsham (Trussel trust). The discovering news was worrying, they had seen a 1000% increase in people using their service at several collection points in Keynsham and the surrounding area. They had also seen a huge drop in food bank donations and money coming into support their service. Therefore, Dan&amp;I have decided to pledge £500 of the money Hafu has earned over the last three weeks towards the Trussel trust and helping those most vulnerable in society. &nbsp;</p><p>If you could donate anything on top of this, it would be hugely appreciated by those most in need.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay safe,</p><p>Dan&amp;Will&nbsp;</p>",34,34,"2020-06-14 30/2020-06-14 30/2020-04-29 10/2020-04-23 30/2020-04-20 30/2020-04-19 30/2020-04-19 30/2020-04-17 30/2020-04-17 44/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-14 30/2020-04-14 50/2020-04-14 20/2020-04-14 20/2020-04-13 100/2020-04-13 30/2020-04-13 20/2020-04-13 50/2020-04-13 20/2020-04-12 20/2020-04-12 10/2020-04-12 20/2020-04-12 10/2020-04-12 10/2020-04-12 500",https://www.justgiving.com/Hafu,2020-06-14,1464,1000,"Hafu foodbank fundraiser "

The children are keen participants in&nbsp;the Malborough and District Kids theatre group and the pantos so they have created a song.

My wife chose to volunteer with the foodbank, while on furlough from her job in Kingsbridge, and has seen the enormous pressure they are suddenly under. I think the numbers of people being helped have jumped from around 25 to 110 per week. They have already had some very kind donations but, as you can imagine, the demand is using up the money fast. To try and raise money my children came up with the idea of singing a song&nbsp;</span><span><a href=""https://youtu.be/qBhFYFel4lw"" target=""_blank""></a></span><a href=""https://youtu.be/qBhFYFel4lw"" target=""_blank""><span>here</span></a>&nbsp;<span>so please give it a watch and, if you can, donate to this worthwhile cause.</span></p><p><span><b>Why you really should care</b></span></p><p><span>I wanted to mention one last thing that has really stuck with my wife. when she visited a family recently. The main earner was self-employed and his business had been forced to stop. As you may know, that means the family will not receive support until June. The lady that answered the door ended up in tears as she explained that she never expected to be in this situation. I have to admit it was very moving to hear her story but thank goodness the Foodbank has been able to help. Please help if you can and if, like the lady above, you find yourself in need, get in touch. There is no judgement, they just want to help.</span></p><p><span>Thank you and stay safe,</span></p><p><span>Jason, Tamara, Olly and Charlotte</span></p><p></p>",53,53,"2020-09-19 30/2020-07-15 30/2020-07-01 50/2020-06-28 30/2020-06-15 30/2020-06-12 20/2020-06-09 20/2020-05-23 20/2020-05-23 20/2020-05-21 20/2020-05-20 50/2020-05-19 20/2020-05-17 50/2020-05-16 20/2020-05-14 50/2020-05-14 20/2020-05-14 500/2020-05-14 10/2020-05-13 5/2020-05-13 30/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 30/2020-05-13 50/2020-05-12 20/2020-05-12 10/2020-05-12 10/2020-05-12 20/2020-05-12 30/2020-05-12 20/2020-05-12 20/2020-05-12 10/2020-05-12 30/2020-05-12 20/2020-05-12 10/2020-05-12 20/2020-05-12 10/2020-05-12 50/2020-05-12 30/2020-05-12 5/2020-05-12 100/2020-05-12 10/2020-05-12 10/2020-05-12 20/2020-05-12 10/2020-05-11 5",https://www.justgiving.com/Jason-Simmonds3,2020-09-19,1835,1850,"Charity Song for Kingsbridge Foodbank"

Many of the people who come to the foodbank are very embarrassed and and down trodden but it is amazing how often they will return up to a year  later and remind us that they received a food parcel but that having found a new job or help with their situation they now want to make a donation back to the foodbank.

However we still need money to run the foodbank, to pay utility bills, purchase and running costs for our delivery van and other expenses.

Trussell Trust foodbanks provide a minimum of three days emergency food and support to people experiencing crisis in the UK. <br><br>All food is donated by the public and sorted by volunteers. Frontline care professionals such as doctors and social workers identify people in crisis and issue a food voucher. Clients receive three days of nutritionally balanced, non-perishable food in exchange for their food voucher. Foodbanks also make time to chat and to signpost clients to other helpful services.<br><br>Hunger is not just a third world problem. Today people across the UK will struggle to feed themselves and their families.

Since April and all through the lockdown, the Southwark Foodbank has been delivering food parcels instead of people collecting them from centres and more than ever are relying on the public's support to keep the services running for even more people. In April alone, foodbank usage went up by 400% in Southwark.

To keep supporters safe, the foodbank is encouraging donations of Funds For Food, instead of physical food donations.

,,,1110522,"The Trussell Trust",True,2020-04-10,"More and more people are being forced to use food banks because they cannot afford the basics in life. Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

S6 Foodbank are expecting the increased need to continue for the foreseeable future, as more people experience difficulty as a result of coronavirus and its wider consequences. I believe that nobody in Sheffield should have to face going hungry. 

A donation of £27 provides food and basic essentials for a family of three for three days. I am aiming to raise at least £40 to help S6 Foodbank reach their £40,000 target.

Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

I've practiced this for nearly 6 months now, I'm also fat adapted so I burn fat instead of glucose for fuel.  Fat lasts much much longer and gives the body what it needs when you can't eat.  This is similar to the ancestral human diet and is what would've happened if they were unable to hunt anything for days.  After a certain period of fasting your body enters into autophagy, where your cells recycle and rejuvenate and get rid of any bad cells.  This is normally the aim for someone doing an extended fast and it's amazing.  So please don't be concerned, I know what I'm doing and there'll be no harm done :)<br></p>",33,33,"2021-04-10 5/2021-04-04 5/2021-04-04 10/2021-04-03 10/2021-04-02 20/2021-04-01 10/2021-04-01 100/2021-03-31 5/2021-03-31 20/2021-03-31 10/2021-03-31 5/2021-03-30 20/2021-03-29 10/2021-03-28 10/2021-03-27 20/2021-03-26 10/2021-03-26 30/2021-03-26 10/2021-03-26 20/2021-03-06 10/2021-03-04 25/2021-03-04 10/2021-03-04 30/2021-03-04 10/2021-03-04 40/2021-03-04 5",https://www.justgiving.com/Jack-McCauley-Deehan7DayFast,2021-04-10,535,0,"Jack's 7 Day fast for South-West Belfast foodbank"

To illustrate this, prior to the crisis our busiest week was in December 2019, where we supported 117 individuals and families across four foodbanks. &nbsp;In the last week of April 2020, just one of our seven foodbanks supported 126 individuals and families.

S6 Foodbank are expecting the increased need to continue for the foreseeable future, as more people experience difficulty as a result of coronavirus and its wider consequences. I believe that nobody in Sheffield should have to face going hungry. 

A donation of £27 provides food and basic essentials for a family of three for three days. I am aiming to raise at least £40 to help S6 Foodbank reach their £40,000 target.

Just donating what you can AND also sharing this page can make a huge difference. I'll be living on £1/day for 6 days at the end of July.</p><p><span><b>Live Below The Line</b></span></p><p><span>Live below the line is a challenge from The Hunger Project. It is quite simply - live below the line for a given time period. Sometimes a day, sometimes 5.</span></p><p><span>The aim is to raise awareness of extreme poverty abroad, nationally and at home, and to raise funds.</span></p><p><span>The line is the world extreme poverty line, below which 1.2 billion people live. That's a mind boggling number. The line is £1 a day. £1 a day for food - all your food for one day.</span></p><p><span>Bringing closer to home: 13 million people live in poverty in the UK. 600,000 of those live in Greater Manchester - 1 in 4 people. 3.9 million children in the UK live in poverty. 91,000 of those are children - the majority have 1 or more parents in work.</span></p><p><span>These are the people that access foodbanks - over 1 million times in the past year. 1 million times when someone would go hungry instead.</span></p><p>They do this week in, week out, unrelentingly.</p><p><b>6 pounds, 6 days</b></p><p>As a result, I will live below the line for 6 days. That's the 5 days people normally do, with a day on top. I'll be doing this from Sunday 23rd July 2017 to Friday 28th July 2017.</p><p><b>Why Manchester Food Bank</b></p><p>It's on our doorstep. It's personal. 1 in 4 people in manchester are in poverty. No-one chooses poverty - poverty chooses them. Manchester Food Bank was seeded by the Trussel Trust, and supported by them as part of their national collective of foodbanks.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Why am I doing this?</b><br></p><p>I'm doing this because I think modern society should be able to exist without people living on the borders of starvation.  Many years ago I had to live on a similar budget to this, but I think things have become worse. I was lucky enough to be able to use education to lift myself out of that. Many people are not lucky enough to do that. In the absence of change, they need assistance.</p><p>I feel strongly that foodbanks should not need to exist, and that they are a failure of society. Until they're no longer needed, those using foodbanks need help.</p><p>Lastly, it's in essence to raise awareness and to try and do something positive that I couldn't do myself.</p><p><b>Why such a high target?</b></p><p>Because it matters. I've picked a figure that is achievable and would make a difference. Yes, it's a hard target, but if I get 1/2 way there I will have succeeded. Every level of support helps. Some baseline numbers: £10 buys a basket of food for an emergency food parcel, £25 buys a family 3 days of food. (£2/day is not luxury), £50 restocks supplies on the things the food back runs short of for 1 week</p><p>Which ever way you look at it, the target makes a difference.<br></p><ul><li>Helps 100 families over a difficult period. Just 100 families. On average 400 people.?</li><li>Or it helps 250 people in a period of emergency<br></li><li>Or it helps the foodbank for a whole year to not worry about things they run short of.</li></ul><p>No matter the actual amount raised though, it makes a difference.<br><br>Bear in mind:</p><ul><li>How much do you spend on entertainment a week / a month? Can you go without that once?</li><li>Rather than a take away, can you cook at home instead?<br></li><li>If you're contemplating a new gadget, can you wait a month and instead donate 1/12th the cost?</li><li>As little as £1 helps, that seems like a little, but it can /literally/ be a day's food for someone.<br></li></ul><p>You might not be in a position to help financially. I get that.</p><ul><li>If you can't give, please share this page, this helps. Each time you share this page, you increase the chances of another £10 towards the goal.</li><li>Failing that, please add foods to a collection point. It goes directly to helping the same foodbanks.</li></ul><p><b>Gift Aid</b><br><br>Please, PLEASE, please gift aid your donation if you can. It boosts the intake. it means that every £20 donated raises £25 for the charity - with the extra £5 coming from taxes you already pay - forcing the govt to do a tiny fraction of their part too.<br></p><div><b>Donate via text</b></div><div><b><br></b>You can also donate via mobile phone. Examples:</div><ul dir=""ltr""><li>If you want to donate 5 days' food - £10 - you do this by texting ""MCFB75 £10"" to 70070</li><li>If you want to donate a day's food - £2 - you do this by texting ""MCFB75 £2"" to 70070</li></ul><p><b>Practicalities</b><br><br>I'll track my progress here: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/sparkslabs . I'll provide proof of costs here as well. The key practicality is that you can only eat foods you buy that week.<br><br>One common/small exception I've noticed is people allow themselves salt and pepper.

We are doing this because a few weeks ago we went to donate to our local foodbank and the lady there told us that some people in our neighbourhood had to choose between eating or staying warm, which we don't think is a choice you should to have to make. We have also been inspired by Marcus Rashford's campaign to help hungry families. We have run before but 50km is a really big challenge for us and we are determined to reach our target.

,,,1169735,"Little Village",False,2020-07-06,"<p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>When I came across the work that Little Village do I was stunned. It’s<span>&nbsp;like a foodbank, but instead of food, it offers essential items like clothing, books, toys and baby equipment to parents in need, right across London. It’s frankly alarming that thousands of families need to rely on ‘hand me downs’ and the good will of other people to barely survive. This is just for essential items. I am saddened that in this day and age tiny babies and children under 5 are going without the most basic of items right here in London, items I completely took for granted when I was pregnant and during the early years of my children growing up.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Can you imagine trying to breastfeed your little one without any breast pads to pop in after? Or not having enough nappies? Imagine not being able to clothe your children appropriately. Imagine trying to entertain your smallest children without the most basic of toys or books?&nbsp;</span></p><p>This is where I think I can make a small difference. As part of my ongoing #asyouaremotherhood campaign across Instagram and Facebook, I'm celebrating and highlighting those of us (silent) women heroes, who everyday, do all we can to provide for our children and to be the best mothers we can be.</p><p>There is such a pressure for us mums to be perfect: we all strive for perfection everyday when the reality is, perfection doesn't exist.</p><p>We all worry, are anxious about whether we're doing the right thing for our unborn baby or the children we already have. We can look at others and think they're somehow doing it better than us, and feel like we've failed.</p><p>We must change our attitudes and change the way we treat ourselves.</p><p>That's why I'm giving away a limited number of mother and baby photoshoots to celebrate how amazing and unique we are as mothers, how we ARE doing all we can to help our children.&nbsp;</p><p>And that our best is good enough. We are good enough.</p><p>Through this project, I can ask pregnant women and mums to come into my studio, get a fabulous photoshoot to show how fabulous they are (just as they are without the need for fancy or OTT props) - and spread the word about self-love and acceptance.&nbsp;</p><p>And then in return all I'd ask is a contribution to Little Village.</p><p><span>This is my way to give back to some struggling families on my own doorstep? Little Village does just that; giving the gift of the most basic but essential things to babies and children who really need them.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>As their website says: “It takes a village to raise a child - this is especially true in London where we often feel alone as parents.</span></p><p><span>“L</span><span>ittle Village is a gift from one family to another, passed on with love.”</span><br></p><p><span>If I ask each of my photography clients to donate, say, just £20 to this cause, I would forgo my booking fee of usually £95. Clients could of course donate more if they wish or were able to, but I thought this would be an excellent start.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So if you're keen to book a Maternity or Baby photoshoot with me, I’ll direct you to this page where you can donate what you can and then we’ll see what happens. Things will snowball from there. Let’s do this together and be part of something hopeful to change the world we live in, right on our doorsteps.</span></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Whilst receiving Chemotherapy, I was feeling sorry for myself and was bored with feeling tired and yukky all the time. It was then I came up with an idea.</p><p>I decided to have a get better list. NOT a bucket list because a bucket list is things to do before you die, but I am planning to be around for a long time yet. Anyway, for every chemo treatment I have added an activity. They are all quite crazy things such as indoor sky diving; trampoline Parks; Go Ape etc. You get the sort of idea</p><p>The next event is taking place on Saturday the 9th June. My daughter has bought the family and I a very strange experience. We are going to be flung off the Killiecrankie bridge on a Bungee Swing. I told her that I was no longer scared of anything but really?!?</p><p>Well here is where you come in. I thought while doing this it may be a good idea to raise money for a good cause. I am hoping to raise money for The Storehouse Foodbank, which is run by the Falkirk VIneyard Church. This is a very important charity and very close to my heart. It seeks to help disadvantaged families in our local areas by providing them with food and other essentials in a time of crisis. If you feel you could contribute anything then I wold be really grateful and it may give the extra incentive to fly off the bridge.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you for your generosity.</p><p>With lots of love</p><p>Michelle</p><p></p>",43,43,"2018-07-12 20/2018-06-14 20/2018-06-11 20/2018-06-10 10/2018-06-10 5/2018-06-08 20/2018-06-08 10/2018-06-07 10/2018-06-07 10/2018-06-07 5/2018-06-07 3/2018-06-07 10/2018-06-06 50/2018-06-03 10/2018-06-02 5/2018-06-02 20/2018-06-02 100/2018-05-31 20/2018-05-27 20/2018-05-27 20/2018-05-25 20/2018-05-25 10/2018-05-25 5/2018-05-24 10/2018-05-24 10/2018-05-24 10/2018-05-23 20/2018-05-23 10/2018-05-23 10/2018-05-23 3/2018-05-23 10/2018-05-23 20/2018-05-22 50/2018-05-22 5/2018-05-22 5/2018-05-22 10/2018-05-21 30/2018-05-21 10/2018-05-21 10/2018-05-21 10/2018-05-21 20/2018-05-21 30/2018-05-20 10",https://www.justgiving.com/Michelle-Gribben1,2018-07-12,716,150,"Michelle's Bungee Swing"

The Trussell Trust aims to end the need for food banks and at this time needs all the help it can get. 100,000 people needed foodbanks for the first time at the start of the pandemic and this Christmas, 670,000 more people will fall into destitution and become unable to afford the essentials of life, let alone the luxuries we all enjoy at Christmas.</p><p><span>Last year, food banks in our network provided more than 1.6 million emergency food parcels to people in crisis. More than half a million of these went to children. It’s not right that people can’t afford the basics.

Without the assistance of people and businesses in Sheffield, S6 Foodbank wouldnt be able to continue to support their guests, launch new sites and tackle the ongoing food crisis in Sheffield which is being exacerbated by coronavirus.

S6 Foodbank are expecting the increased need to continue for the foreseeable future, as more people experience difficulty as a result of coronavirus and its wider consequences. I believe that nobody in Sheffield should have to face going hungry. 

A donation of £27 provides food and basic essentials for a family of three for three days. I am aiming to raise at least £40 to help S6 Foodbank reach their £40,000 target. Whatever I raise (up to that target) will be match-funded by the Government via the Love Your Neighbour partnership, meaning S6 Foodbank receives double the amount.

Fortunately, my accomplice for the day, Nick Green, had not and was making tea for a quick vigil on the back patio before we set out on the long tramp around Wivenhoe.<br>Although I had done some scouting for key breeding birds on territory, the cold, windy conditions would make it something of a lottery on the day – especially at dawn – as to whether the birds would betray their presence with any song.<br>The Tawny Owls we might have hoped to hear from the back patio drew a blank. The wind was such that we could not hear anything from the estuary as we sometimes can, so we set off at 04.55 for Ferry Marsh. High tide, for what it was worth (it wasn’t going to be e big one) was at around 07.30, so we simply walked around ferry marsh on the sea wall (it is still impassable due to flooding) without lingering. We picked up Sedge, Reed and Cettis warbler without any effort, plus Common &amp; Lesser Whitethroat in the dawn chorus. No Chiffchaffs were heard until we walked back through the woods after looping through them from Lower Lodge after the return journey from opposite the Hythe on the trail. Along the river, we predictably scored Greenshank, Nightingale (2 territorial males either side of the river at Hythe), Common Tern and the more common waders, but no Spotted Redshank or Ruff as we might have hoped. A male Sparrowhawk swooped past us near the Uni and Bullfinches were barely audible above the breeze at the level crossing. The otherwise time-saving scope from Lower Lodge to the lagoons was passed up, but at great distance it would have been nigh impossible to see the Green Sandpipers and other smaller waders from that distance. We had seen 3 Avocets on the estuary the previous day, so felt confident that we would connect more easily than a long-range scan. With just over 2 hours to walk to the Hythe and then Wivenhoe Woods en route to Alresford Creek for high tide, we moved quite quickly. No Nightingales were in song in Wivenhoe wood. In fact, very few birds were evident. There were a couple of Jays to keep the total ticking over but by now, the lack of bird song was slightly concerning. A Cuckoo did at least make itself heard from across the river.<br>Back on the trail after Wivenhoe Woods, we connected with House Martins around West Quay. The walk to the creek yielded only Whimbrel and Bar-tailed Godwit, so we arrived at the metal bench with 40 minutes to scan across to Geedon Marsh before our breakfast rendezvous with Mark Norrington. A brief stop at the barrier did not yield Grey Wagtail, as hoped.<br>The vigil and the walk along to the bottom of Ford Lane for bacon rolls and coffee, courtesy of Mark, moved the species total from 62 to 71. We darted back to the creek mouth watch point as the wader and wildfowl count to that point was paltry... It seemed evident that most, if not all the usual wintering wildfowl and waders had cleared out, such that, other than the plentiful Whimbrels, we did not add anywhere near the numbers at Alresford that we had hoped, with Golden, Grey and Ringed Plover, Knot, Avocet, Spotted Redshank and Common Sandpiper all absent, as well as Wigeon, Teal and Brent Goose – all of which we would have expected.<br>We felt that we were 15 species short of where we needed to be when we dragged ourselves away from the creek with 79 species to our name, with one Mediterranean Gull making itself heard above the breeze. At least Little Owl provided an easy hit at Plumptons farm; Buzzards and Marsh Harriers were showing regularly without any thermals to speak of, but there were no more exotic raptors or larger migrants to add. We would have another chance with a later (not very) high tide late in the day, but at this stage, a total of 100 looked very distant, if not impossible without a significant fall of passage migrants. The walk along Cutthroat Lane to Sunnymead &amp; Cockaynes was very quiet. Our remaining hopes of Treecreeper and Coal Tit would be at Cockaynes or Villa wood.<br>To our abject dismay, there was no Willow Warbler or Garden Warbler in song at Cockaynes. As the clock neared 1pm, I called Debbie to suggest she stays at home rather than deliver our lunch. Discretion became the better part and we managed to trek across Ballast Quay track to aarive back at home for an extended lunch break and a discussion on how we were even going to get over 90, let alone 100.<br>The biggest gaps in the list of hopefuls (if no longer probables) were of estuarine species, notable by their absence in the first tidal phase. Other incidental passerine species and their likely sites were well spread across the area. The other issue was that Nick had only just recovered from illness and we had already walked 12 miles on just a few hours sleep...<br>By the time we had eaten as many turkey sandwiches as we could, Nick had retired for a “lie down”. I thought that this would be effectively the end of his participation so togged up again and decided to head out to the creek, via the trail, to see if I could mop up some migrants and to get much luckier with estuarine species. Realistically, this was highly unlikely, but in the context of achieving the highest possible total, this was the obvious option. <br>To my amazement, as I neared the jetty, Nick called to say that he had woken after barely 30 minutes! We agreed to meet at the creek. By then, I had caught up with the pair of Grey Wagtails on the barrier having heard the male gently singing there from the jetty. The two birds showed briefly before I marched determinedly toward Nick.<br>Whilst there was nothing new on Barrier Marsh, I was tempted to stop briefly for a Nightingale that was very close to the path in an elevated position. I managed to zoom through a small opening to pick out the bird with the camera and stole quite a pleasing shot.<br>By the time I reached Nick at the bench, all threats of rain had gone and we enjoyed the next 90 minutes in mostly bright sunshine, doing our best to identify silhouetted images between us and Geedon saltings.<br>In this time, Nick did brilliantly to pick out a lone Brent Goose and I was able to lock on to a Great White Egret over the saltings. This put us on 82 for the day, but it was now obvious that the estuarine species had all but moved on. A flock of Dunlins were still in the creek, some of which were in almost full summer plumage, as were the Turnstones and 2 of the half dozen or so Bar-tailed Godwits to raise the spirits a little.<br>Had we stayed out for the rest of the day until dark, we might have added 2 or 3 more species, but there was no way we were going to get near 100, so we called it a day and declared our innings total at 82 species with 17 miles walked.<br>At the time of writing, we have raised £320 plus GiftAid. I will be doing other activities in a bid to raise this, including a bird finding schedule and making greeting cards with wildlife photos to benefit the Food Bank. <br><br><br><br><br></p><p><br></p>",15,15,"2019-04-28 10/2019-04-28 30/2019-04-27 30/2019-04-26 10/2019-04-26 10/2019-04-25 30/2019-04-25 20/2019-04-22 30/2019-04-12 50/2019-03-27 10/2019-03-19 20/2019-03-18 10/2019-03-18 20/2019-03-18 30",https://www.justgiving.com/Glyn-EvansWivBirds,2019-04-28,320,1000,"Glyn's Wivenhoe Bird Race"

,,,SC044200,"Renfrewshire Foodbank",False,2019-12-03,"<div>We are passionate St.Mirren supporters who run the Black &amp; White Army supporters website and twitter page (@bawarmy).</div><div><br></div><div>On Dec 2nd we launched what we thought would be a bit of community minded festive fun ahead of a huge run of pre-Christmas fixtures for our team.</div><div><div><div><div><br><p>With Christmas on the way we are even more mindful of those in our local community who are struggling and following up on the amazingly successful Foodbank collections we've seen at the stadium in recent times we thought we'd join in and try and raise some funds for the Renfrewshire Foodbank.</p>Our challenge to the team was simple. For every point gained in the four fixtures leading up to Christmas the B&amp;W Army site would donate £25 to the foodbank.That meant a glorious 12 point haul against Motherwell, Hamilton, Livingston and St.Johnstone would lead to a whopping £300 donation.</div><div><br></div><div>So then we started getting messages from other fans who wanted to join in, and it started to grow and grow and grow and we had pledges coming in from all over the place. That list of heroes who pledged is shown on our own site here at this link;</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b> https://www.blackandwhitearmy.com/12pointsofchristmas</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>An incredible £2648 per point, pledged by almost 500 supporters!!!<br></b></div><div><br></div><div>The plan was, and still is, to tally up our points haul after the four matches and to contact all our pledgers on 22nd December to ask for their final donation.</div><div><br></div><div>We have however decided to open up the page now for a number of reasons;<br><br>1) Some supporters just want to make a one-off contribution<br>2) Plenty fans want to donate regardless of the results.We can't lie. There is always a risk that we lose all the games :-(<br>3) Fans can donate as they go, rather than all in one lump at the end<br>4) We appreciate the Foodbank may be especially stretched at this time of year.<br>5) We completely appreciate that everyones finances get hammered at this time of year!<br><br>So here we are, the page is open. We obviously don't know what our target is going to be as it will be dependent on the points we gain, but we're starting off with a 1 point target of £2648.</div><div><br>We will adjust and update the page as the matches are played.<br><br>Thanks to each and every person who has pledged and who has supported and shared this. Other football fans have also joined in which has been massively appreciated, and some of them aren't even from Renfrewshire which is even more amazing!<br></div></div></div></div><p><br></p>",660,660,"2020-01-17 25/2020-01-09 12/2020-01-09 30/2020-01-09 125/2020-01-08 48/2020-01-03 15/2020-01-03 30/2020-01-03 25/2020-01-02 10/2019-12-31

,,,1190974,"Weymouth Foodbank",False,2020-12-30,"<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>2020 has been a difficult year for everyone but clearly some are affected more than others. Having had a lot of support from the Weymouth community after starting my new business venture, I wanted to look at ways to give something back in return.&nbsp;</p><p>I have never been a runner and at 56 years of age could not see me starting to put the lycra on so I have looked at something that most of us could do and that is walk. My day usually consists of working up to 12 hours, so I will be walking every day come rain, shine or even snow but will have to fit in around my work by doing this very early in the morning or later in the evening. However, I planned to do a fixed walk a week when anybody could come and join me for support or to just get a bit of extra exercise. <b>LOCKDOWN HAS CHANGED THIS</b> <b>UNFORTUNATELY</b> but I can still walk with one person so if you would like to join me then please contact me prior so that we do not have more than one at a time. <b>This will be on every Sunday at 9.30am&nbsp; starting at the Oasis Cafe at Overcombe and </b><b>walking to Weymouth Pavilion and back</b>. This is 4.51 miles (7.25 km) and with a brisk pace takes an hour and 10/15 minutes. Please feel free to join me and get a shout out on one of the regular video updates. The 500 km walk will finish when it finishes but could take 2 months which will help to extend the fund raising period.</p><p>As a local Estate Agent, I pledge £50 for everyone of my personal completed sales throughout 2021. This is in addition to the £1500 target I have given and would like to smash</p><p>Having researched and spoken to the brilliant people that run the Weymouth Foodbank, I was staggered to learn that <b>15% of the</b> <b>Weymouth population live with food insecurity. </b>Since lockdown the foodbank has gone from supporting up to 40 local families to up to 90 families and supply food that gives three balanced meals a day for a three day period. Support from the local community when doing their regular weekly shopping, by placing extra items into foodbank trolley's are extremely valuable. So much more is required to put these supplies together from the three outlets in Weymouth such as tinned meats, tinned vegetables, tinned fruit along with fresh ingredients such as milk, cheese, bread etc which have a short shelf life. In addition to this there is a warehouse on the Granby Industrial Estate that also requires funds for insurance, and general running costs.</p><p>Thank you in advance for your support</p><p><b>Jon Williams</b></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

We work with over 100 organisations who refer people to our foodbank, who through various circumstances are unable to afford to buy enough food to keep body and soul together.

Many of the people who come to the foodbank are very embarrassed and and down trodden but it is amazing how often they will return up to a year  later and remind us that they received a food parcel but that having found a new job or help with their situation they now want to make a donation back to the foodbank.

However we still need money to run the foodbank, to pay utility bills, purchase and running costs for our delivery van and other expenses.  We have 1 paid member of staff, our Manager, and 80 volunteers who do a power of work collecting and sorting the donated food and dealing with the people who are in need in a caring and compassionate way.

As a team we all decided we'd love to break a world record to support our school charity, <b>The Gateshead Foodbank. </b>We looked through the World Records database and found that the record for the <b>World's Longest Food Passing Relay</b> was yet to be broken. We thought that attempting this record would be a great way to raise awareness of and funding for the Foodbank.</p><p><span>To break the world record for the World’s Longest Food Passing<br>Relay we will need a minimum of <b>1000 people and 10 items of food</b>. To achieve the record everyone must stand in a long line (like a very long snake!) and the first person in the line must pass each food item to the next person in line, and so on until all 1000 people have held each item of food. If we can achieve this we will have broken a world record!</span></p><p><span>Anyone is welcome to take part in our record attempt.

We called it ""Walk This Way"" - inspired by the classic collaboration between Aerosmith and Run DMC. Collaboration was at the heart of the project, and I remain fiercely proud of what we achieved together.</p><p>This time, it is a solo challenge! I've taken my inspiration from ""500 Miles (I'm Gonna Be)"" by The Proclaimers. Just like the song, I'm going to walk 500 miles.&nbsp; All walks will be done to be COVID secure and in accordance with the latest guidance from government whether we are in lockdown or out of lockdown. The focus of my challenge this time is to raise money for the amazing Newquay Foodbank who do so much to support the most vulnerable families in this incredible community. It is especially important that these families are supported now, especially as more families have found themselves in unexpected financial hardship as a result of COVID restrictions and two national Lockdowns.&nbsp;</p><p>From a personal perspective, I know what it is like to grow up in a family that was subject to financial hardship and the shadow of poverty when my dad was unemployed back in the 1980s. I remember the humiliation heaped upon me from others as I had to wear second hand clothes (not vintage or pre-loved as they are often referred to now). The memory of that was one of the defining factors that resulted in me becoming a secondary school teacher.&nbsp; It makes me beyond sad to consider that there will be children in Newquay today who will experience the same or similar things to those that I experienced back when I was young.</p><p>So please support me in this challenge. Please spread the news of what I'm trying to do on social media. Please spread the stories of how Newquay Foodbank (and other equally wonderful charities and organisations) are helping those people who are most in need of our help.</p><p>And finally... will you be one of my 500 smiles?&nbsp; I'm looking for at least 500 wonderful people who are willing to donate to this Just Giving page a minimum of £5.00 to support the work of Newquay Foodbank throughout this Lockdown and whatever comes after it. That would raise a lot of money to help a lot of people right here in Newquay.</p><p>Here's one final music reference for you - anybody and everybody who contributes money to this fundraiser for Newquay Foodbank would undoubtedly become one of my ""Heroes""... but for more than one day.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",25,25,"2021-02-10 20/2021-02-05 10/2021-02-05 20/2021-02-05 10/2021-02-04 10/2021-02-04 20/2021-02-03 10/2021-02-03 10/2021-02-03 5/2021-02-03 5/2021-02-03 10/2021-02-03 5/2021-02-02 10/2021-02-01 20/2021-02-01 10/2021-02-01 10/2021-01-22 10/2021-01-22 5",https://www.justgiving.com/Grahaeme-Jones500m,2021-03-30,270,1000,"Grahaeme's The 500 Mile Challenge"

I was pretty badly beaten and woke the following day in a hospital bed with my parents by my side. The physical injuries healed, of course, but the mental scars from that night haunt me still to this day. I was afraid to leave the hospital. Then when I did go home, I was afraid to leave the house. The nightmares, flashbacks, new fear of people, fear of the dark…. It all started then. <br><br>What has this got to do with Rutland Food Bank, you ask?<br>Well, nothing.<br>But while I was once doing quite well and was going out walking everyday, I have allowed myself to become stuck in a rut again - afraid to go out apart from a few regular places that I know, when I have someone to go with me...</p><p>This morning I really wanted to go for a walk, but, I found myself ""stuck"". Too afraid to get in the car and go... This is crazy. I used to walk around Hambleton Peninsular almost every day, and now I find myself too scared to go... I need an incentive...<br><br>So, I have decided that I need to tell the world (well, Rutland anyway!) that I'm going for a walk, so that you can hold me to account if I don't! But more than that, I thought it would be nice if I can raise some money for those in the local community who are struggling at the moment.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm going to try to walk1000miles again in 2021 having not completed the challenge during 2020 - and to start me off I would like to walk the first 5 days for the people of Rutland. I will walk around Hambleton Peninsular at Rutland water once each day and hope to raise £50 for Rutland Food Bank - any more than that would be fantastic! I myself will donate £2 per day which I will add as one payment of £10 at the end of the 5 days.<br><br>(I just want to add a little disclaimer here incase any new Covid Restrictions come into force which prevent me from walking around Hambleton Peninsular on any or all of the first 5 days of January. If this does happen I will walk as soon as any new restrictions are lifted.)</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

My mileage has crept up to approaching a half marathon, so&nbsp; I thought I'd push through to 13.1 miles and use it as an opportunity to try and raise some money for good causes.&nbsp;</p><p>Primarily I'm raising money for the local food bank so they can help people struggling during the incoming recession. I'll also donate an additional 50% of whatever I raise to Music Venues Trust, who are trying to stop grassroots music venues from closing. Across the UK, 35% of venues have closed after the last decade. With venues forced to close during the lockdown, and possibly some of the last businesses to re-open, there's a real risk that many more will close without our support in the coming months. Thanks!</p><p>As I'll be running on my own, I will only be competing against myself when I ran a half marathon a decade ago. If I don't beat Young Robin on the first go I will keep going until I do. In the interests of transparency, my previous time was 1 hour 44 minutes, which is incidentally faster than TV's Andrew Lincoln who ran the Cardiff Half the same year.</p>",22,22,"2020-07-01 10/2020-06-27 10/2020-06-26 10/2020-06-25 10/2020-06-11 20/2020-06-09 20/2020-06-05 10/2020-06-05 20/2020-06-05 15/2020-06-04 10/2020-06-04 20/2020-06-04 20/2020-06-03 10/2020-06-03 5/2020-06-03 20/2020-06-03 10/2020-06-03 20/2020-06-03 20/2020-06-03 25/2020-06-03 50/2020-06-03 10",https://www.justgiving.com/Robin-Wilkinson1,2020-07-01,370,150,"Robin's lockdown half marathon"

With this ethos in mind, each member of the team plans to contribute to the challenge in whatever way they possibly can, covering distances big or small using their own preferred method.</p><p>If we manage to complete the distance before a month is up we will keep count of kms covered and see if there are any other interesting landmarks we can get to. If we don't manage it, we will keep going and see how much longer after the month it takes.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Finally, the serious bit: the coronavirus pandemic has placed </span>unprecedented<span>&nbsp;strain on foodbank services throughout the UK as more and more people find themselves in difficult financial positions as a result of the changing economic landscape.

We work with over 100 organisations who refer people to our foodbank, who through various circumstances are unable to afford to buy enough food to keep body and soul together.

Many of the people who come to the foodbank are very embarrassed and and down trodden but it is amazing how often they will return up to a year  later and remind us that they received a food parcel but that having found a new job or help with their situation they now want to make a donation back to the foodbank.

However we still need money to run the foodbank, to pay utility bills, purchase and running costs for our delivery van and other expenses.  We have 1 paid member of staff, our Manager, and 80 volunteers who do a power of work collecting and sorting the donated food and dealing with the people who are in need in a caring and compassionate way.

Without the assistance of people and businesses in Sheffield, S6 Foodbank wouldnt be able to continue to support their guests, launch new sites and tackle the ongoing food crisis in Sheffield which is being exacerbated by coronavirus.

S6 Foodbank are expecting the increased need to continue for the foreseeable future, as more people experience difficulty as a result of coronavirus and its wider consequences. I believe that nobody in Sheffield should have to face going hungry. 

A donation of £27 provides food and basic essentials for a family of three for three days. I am aiming to raise at least £40 to help S6 Foodbank reach their £40,000 target. Whatever I raise (up to that target) will be match-funded by the Government via the Love Your Neighbour partnership, meaning S6 Foodbank receives double the amount.

No. 93 (formerly the Harpurhey Wellbeing Centre)&nbsp;</span><span>opened it's doors in November 2020 and in the first month they have already distributed 66 emergency food parcels which is equivalent to 600 meals.</span></p><p><span>We don’t think anyone in our community should have to face going hungry. That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks, supported by The Trussell Trust, working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.</span><br><br>For more details on the amazing work being done, please visit www.manchestercentral.foodbank.org.uk</p><p><span><b>So why a Canadian theme you ask?&nbsp;</b></span><span>Everyone who knows me, knows my love of ice hockey and Canada is the home of hockey. Due to the global pandemic, the NHL restructured all divisions so for 2021 there will be an all-Canadian division.</span></p><p></p><p><b>How will I record progress? </b>This will be either via the Strava app (if I'm on my bike) or the LFConnect app (if I'm in the gym).

,,,1157499,"North Bristol Foodbank",False,2019-12-18,"<p>As somebody who was lucky enough to be born round about this<br>time of year, December’s always been a month of receiving for me. This year I’d like to change that, and instead of receiving presents I’d like to give something back to a community that is now in need of help more than ever. </p><p>Having had a rather hedonistic time at uni (still embarrassed<br>about that time I ate a whole pasta bake for four in one sitting tbh), and in light of the political events of last week, I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting on my own relative privilege and the state of the world around me. You can’t really turn on the news, or go on social media without being reminded that the world is a Horrible Place, and there’s very little you can do about it. Bad people are in charge, everything is getting hotter, and I’m never going to reach 5’4”. It’s all very disheartening.</p><p>So if other people can’t make good things happen, I’m going<br>to try my very best to do it myself. During the pre-election madness, I saw numerous statistics on Twitter that really shocked me, and in particular quite a few on food bank usage in the UK. More people are using food banks than ever before, and this number has increased from the tens of thousands in 2010 to the millions this year. The reasons behind this increase can be disputed to no end, but I think regardless of political persuasion you can agree that they’re a<br>highly valuable resource for many. One that shouldn’t need to exist, but one that pretty much means life or death for those that need them.</p><p>For that reason I’d like to collect donations for the North<br>Bristol Foodbank this year, the foodbank that’s local to both myself and many of you that I know. There’s been a 54% increase in demand from North Bristol foodbank from April-Sept 2019, and as the winter draws in, the demand only increases. Christmas isn’t going to be the best time of year for many, and even if you can’t donate I hope you can keep them on your mind over the festive season. </p><p>I’ve created this page for any donations you’d like<br>to make! I would appreciate them much more than any Christmas/birthday presents (although if you’ve already bought them, I won’t say no…), and they’ll do much more good as well. Also, if you’re around to give me something in person, you have no excuse now <span>😊</span></p><p>Thanks!</p>",20,20,"2019-12-27 10/2019-12-27 15/2019-12-27 30/2019-12-26 20/2019-12-25 15/2019-12-24 50/2019-12-22 10/2019-12-20 5/2019-12-19 20/2019-12-19 20/2019-12-19 10/2019-12-19 5/2019-12-19 20/2019-12-19 20/2019-12-18 5/2019-12-18 10/2019-12-18 12/2019-12-18 3",https://www.justgiving.com/mee-mee-turns-19,2019-12-27,328,300,"Mee-Mee's Birthday"

We will be accepting&nbsp;donations until 2pm on Friday 11<sup>th</sup> December and since we have 11&nbsp;days to go we thought we’d stretch the target to £1500 and share this drive throughout Scotland. Teenagers are often not thought about for donation drives&nbsp;as the target tends to be younger children and the magic of Christmas, however&nbsp;our teens are in as much need. If you haven’t donated and would like to make a&nbsp;real difference in someone’s life please take the time to support this cause.&nbsp;****</span></p><p>Christmas and the holiday season can be such a magical time for us all - but for those less fortunate it can also be a time of great sadness.</p><p>While we all celebrate, some may find themselves in a position where they are not able to afford any gifts for themselves or their love ones, and join in on the festivities. This, accompanied with potentially a lack of food to go around, can make Christmas a real struggle.</p><p>That's why we've teamed up with Glasgow South East Foodbank. At the Glasgow South East Foodbank, they aim to provide those in need, with a Christmas / Holiday food hamper, some small gifts such as shower gels, and ideally a £20 gift card to help during the holiday season.</p><p>To promote this cause, an aid our own wellbeing, four of us&nbsp;from the team will collectively walk 100 miles within a week, all while working&nbsp;full time, juggling childcare needs and the monotony of the tier 4&nbsp;restrictions. From Monday 30<sup>th</sup> November to Sunday 06<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>December Graeme Davidson, Joe Simmons, Louise McShane and Connor Johnston will&nbsp;be walking during breaks, meetings (where possible) or just up and down the&nbsp;stairs when we get free time to get that step count up. Support us by supporting this amazing cause.<span></span></p><p>With our donations this year, we can help give as many teens a Christmas, and give them something to look forward to. Something we all desperately need this year.</p><p>We ask that you please consider donating this year.

This year is different in so many ways but the kids have had enough taken from them. Lets keep the joy alive by decorating our houses as normal and also displaying a poster. Rather than trick or treating and giving out sweets, children can try and spot as many posters in windows/porches etc as possible. Our families remain safe and the children have a spooky trail to follow. How many posters will they spot? Plus, we can donate the money we would spend on sweets and treats to help those that have suffered during this difficult time. Win-win!</p><p>I have created the poster in black and white so that it can be coloured in by your little pumpkins (or yourself)!

There is a growing number of people that have not even been able to access the most basic necessity of life - food.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020 there has been nearly a 50% increase in people needing Foodbanks in my hometown of Leeds. Although we may be seeing light at the end of the tunnel in terms of easing of restrictions and a return to ‘normality’ in the city the economic effects of the crisis will be long lasting and continue to be devastating for huge numbers of people.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Leeds South and East and North and West Foodbanks manage 20 distribution centres across the Leeds area and have provided essential food supplies for more than 40,000 vulnerable people across the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foodbanks are seeing a massive increase in clients accessing their services who have been affected by the crisis including people who’ve lost their job or source of income. There are also people who have suffered domestic violence and worsened mental health. People who find life a daily struggle.&nbsp;<br><br>The increased demand for the Foodbanks' services has resulted in an ongoing challenge for funds to feed the growing number of people that need assistance. I know it’s been tough for everyone but there are many people out there who urgently need emergency food.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your donation will directly contribute to a fantastic organisation and network that makes a real difference.&nbsp;<br><br>Struggling On Together…<br><br>Leeds Foodbanks&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Just to clarify -&nbsp;<br><span>Foodbanks are a nationwide initiative organised individually at local level.

Next month, however, they will be working together in the name of charity, in order to help those less fortunate.</p><p>Their overarching goal is simple. With 33 members of staff from both businesses taking part, they hope to raise as much money as possible by pushing their bodies to the limit, as well as encouraging other companies to get involved and support the cause in any way they can.</p><p><span>What is the ‘Route 66 Challenge’?</span></p><p>The Route 66 Challenge is the ultimate test of fitness, endurance and resilience. Over 28 days, the brave participants will be required to run, walk or cycle approximately 3,940km, which is the length of Route 66, working out at around 5km per person per day.</p><p>This will, of course, be no easy challenge, but the team are confident that they can rise to the occasion and fight through the pain as they seek to provide support for those who need it most in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The idea to base the challenge around the distance of Route 66 was conceived by Jacob Scott an employee at Goodall Brazier, who wanted to highlight the connections between these UK businesses and their US operations.</p><p>The challenge begins on Monday 1st February and will end on Sunday 28th February. As mentioned above, the team will be able to complete the distance by walking, running or cycling. Regular updates will be posted on both company LinkedIn pages, and each athlete will be noting their progress as they attempt to smash their target.</p><h3>Why is the challenge taking place?</h3><p>While the Route 66 Challenge will be a fantastic team-building opportunity that promotes unity collaboration between two businesses, there is a very real issue that lies at the heart of it.</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic has thrown up challenges for everyone; many people have struggled massively, including experiencing financial problems, being made redundant from work and suffering from loneliness and depression as a result of not being able to see their loved ones.</p><p>In particular, mental health has been a particularly poignant issue during this crisis. According to the Centre for Mental Health, approximately 10 million people in the UK (almost 20% of the population) will need new or additional mental health support as a result of COVID-19.</p><p>While statistics like this are difficult to digest, they serve as extra motivation for the team to go above and beyond, committing themselves to the cause to help those who are less fortunate. If they can do their bit to give back to others, then this challenge will all be worth it and more.</p><p>Speaking on the importance of being able to help others, Toby Harris, Managing Director at Harris + Co said:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><em><i>“I gave Conor a ring one evening and we both agreed that it was the perfect time to do something like this. While we’re all in lockdown again, there aren’t a great deal of fundraisers or charity events happening, so we wanted to do as much as possible.”</i></em></strong></p><p><strong><em><i>“We’ve had a fantastic start to 2021, and like many others, were focused on survival throughout last year. Now we have got through that period, we feel in a strong place as a business, and we want to help those who are struggling day in day out. We’re incredibly grateful to be in this position, and we want to help those who are struggling. The challenge is going to be tough, but we cannot wait to get started and make a real difference during this difficult period.”</i></em></strong></p><p>Conor Firth, Managing Director at Goodall Brazier, said:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><em><i>“With so many people having their lives turned upside down during the coronavirus pandemic, it only seems right that we should do something to help. Toby and I are always looking for ways in which we can give back to local and wider communities, and we’re delighted that our employees have stepped up and put their names forward for this challenge.”</i></em></strong></p><p><strong><em><i>“It’s a brilliant opportunity for us to stay physically and mentally active during this lockdown, as well as being able to raise money for some fantastic causes. Bring on Route 66!”</i></em></strong></p><h3>How you can get involved</h3><p>While the brave volunteers at Harris + Co and Goodall Brazier will be taking on the challenge, there are so many ways in which you can get involved to support them. If you run a business that has managed to survive this pandemic and you want to show your support in helping those in need, you can contact Toby or Conor directly on LinkedIn to find out more.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps your team could run the length of Route 66 also to complete a round-trip, or even take on a brand new challenge of your own? As long as we’re all united in our efforts, we can achieve great things!</p><p>Likewise, if you are part of a charity, or know of any worthy causes that need some additional support right now, please do not hesitate to reach out. The aim of this challenge is to help as many people as possible, and your support in helping do that would be welcomed.</p><p>The team will be updating everyone with their progress on LinkedIn, as well as on our dedicated fundraiser page, which will be live this week.</p><p>Both Harris + Co and Goodall Brazier would like to thank you in advance for your support.&nbsp;</p><p>Bring it on!</p><p><span>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</span><br></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

People on low incomes because of zero-hours contracts and part-time work are also frequent clients...along with those suffering debt - often because of gas and electric bills.

We are delighted to hit our initial target of £500 so quickly and have now increased this to £1000! In terms of progress, we have completed grade 2 and 3 exams (waiting for the results from ABRSM) and are now working on grade 4 repertoire. If we complete the challenge earlier than planned, we will attempt to go up to grade 6 by December! We will continue to update you as we go along in the coming months.

We could set a challenge and do some fundraising!""</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Mr Bunn has been keen to learn the clarinet for many years, as other members of his family also play this instrument. For Mr Deakin, it has been a life-long dream to learn how to play the cello as it is one of the most beautiful instruments. But then he realised that he didn't want to have to carry a huge case around everywhere, so he decided to learn the violin instead...</span><br></p><p><span>...&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>Anyway, after 6 weeks of scratching/scraping/squeaking/squawking our way through our new challenge (whilst both slightly regretting those optimistic words, said after 17 cups of coffee on a long day of recording for Carol Service 2020), we are both preparing to take our grade 2 exams in March 2021! We are aiming to achieve grade 5 on our new instruments by the end of the calendar year, in the winter exam season sometime in December. As well as this being a personal challenge, we are raising money for Shrewsbury Food Bank at&nbsp;<span>Barnabas Church Centre, Shrewsbury SY3 7DN, to try and help some of the most vulnerable members in our community during Christmas 2021. The past 12 months have been difficult for everyone, but winter - and particularly Christmas - represent the most challenging period of all for many, and we would love to give our support during this time...&nbsp;</span></span></p><p>We are aiming to raise as much money as possible throughout 2021, with a view to submitting our donation at the start of December to aide Barnabas throughout the Christmas period. We would absolutely love to surpass our target of £500 and would be very grateful for any amount of support you could give us - big or small - towards hitting this goal. We will be posting regular updates, vlogs (for your amusement and entertainment) and exam certificates (well, hopefully!) to keep you up-to-date with our progress throughout the challenge.</p><p><span>Thank you so much in advance for your support.</span></p><p><span>With best wishes,</span></p><p><span>Mr Deakin&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Mr Bunn&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span><br> &nbsp;</span></p>",54,54,"2021-05-17 10/2021-04-17 25/2021-04-10 10/2021-03-14 10/2021-03-11 20/2021-03-10 20/2021-03-08 10/2021-03-08 10/2021-03-08 10/2021-03-08 20/2021-03-01 10/2021-03-01 5/2021-02-23 20/2021-02-22 5/2021-02-22 10/2021-02-21 20/2021-02-12 20/2021-02-12 10/2021-02-09 10/2021-02-09 10/2021-02-08 10/2021-02-06 10/2021-02-06 10/2021-02-06 10/2021-02-06 10/2021-02-06 5/2021-02-05 10/2021-02-02 10/2021-02-02 10/2021-02-02 10/2021-02-01 10/2021-02-01 10/2021-02-01 10/2021-02-01 10/2021-01-31 10/2021-01-30 10/2021-01-30 10/2021-01-30 20/2021-01-30 10/2021-01-30 10/2021-01-30 20/2021-01-30 10/2021-01-29 10/2021-01-29 10/2021-01-29 20/2021-01-29 30/2021-01-29 20",https://www.justgiving.com/shrewsburyhighschoolgrade5athon,2021-05-17,765,1000,"Mr Deakin and Mr Bunn run a Grade-5-athon!"
