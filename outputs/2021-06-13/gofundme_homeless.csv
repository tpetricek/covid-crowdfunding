Sadly we only recently discovered this chairty and found out that they do not receive much support. They are deprived of necessities and are in urgent need of food and vital amenities.     There are over 150 children/adults who have been abandoned and live at this orphanage/care home. 41 are children aged 6-18 (4 girls and 37 boys). Some are orphans  some have been abandoned by their parents who want to remarry  have mental health issues and can no longer care for them or are in mental institutions or even prison.    The rest are adults or the elderly who have nobody or were abandoned by their families and made homeless so they rely on the association as a shelter.    Our aim is to raise £5000 to buy them as much food as we can. Any extra funds we raise will be put towards buying them clothes and toys.     Samia and Aya are currently in Morocco and have visited the association. They were able to buy them some necessities but this is nowhere near enough. The kids were so happy to see the ketchup and the snacks they took so we want to buy them more and more!     Samia and Aya will be volunteering at the association over the next few weeks. They will also be buying and delivering all the items once we reach our goal.    We will be providing updates so everyone can see the process and delivery of the items.     Please help us share and spread the word. X      This is Rahma. She was an orphan.

He’d started walking from Kent 10 months ago when he became homeless and not wanting to be stagnant and homeless or turn to begging for money he decided to start walking. He just recently passed through my village on the north coast of Cornwall. When I chanced upon him  he was tired in need of respite and his equipment was damaged so he spent a few days staying in our caravan to recuperate. He soon went off on his way again and I asked him he would mind me sharing a bit of his story and to ask if people could keep an eye out for him.    He had some pretty shocking stories about his experiences of sleeping rough and peoples tolerance of homelessness. The fact that he’s turned some elements of his misfortunes into a journey and into something positive is really quite amazing. As well as being homeless he is mildly autistic he is very lovely and walking the coastline  heading North and if you would like to help him on his journey he needs a new tent and some food and my husband and I are trying to find a way to help him so that he can have some security for a while.

My SEISS grant from the government has been stopped for all self-employed people until late April/early May  and until then I have no means to pay for food  bills  and ongoing fixed business costs etc. I receive nothing for the limited company part of my income. I live on my own with a mortgage to pay  and a cat to look after. The SEISS grant has been far from adequate and I have fallen into arrears with my bills and mortgage and am currently facing the prospect of my house being repossessed and potentially losing my car.    I have tried to mitigate these circumstances by applying for a job in December with the NHS. I successfully completed online study and tests and got the job 'in theory' but it doesn't look like there is a job to go to at present  so am having to start from scratch with my search once again.     The picture is of me  when I slept in a cardboard box in winter for the Framework Charity  to raise money for the homeless  and to prevent homelessness. I did this three times and raised over £1500 for the charity. I have been an active fundraiser for many charities all my life (most recently Framework HA  Cancer Research  and We R Here) and worked voluntarily for the Framework HA charity  Brinsley Animal Rescue Centre  Arnold Job Club  Nottinghamshire Hospice  National Autistic Society and Help the Aged. I never thought I'd find myself in a situation where I would need to rely on charity from others. It feels alien to me  and almost self-indulgent/mercenary  but here I am  after some serious pride-swallowing. No-one could have prepared for what some of us have had to face over the past year.     This is what I normally do when we're not in the middle of a pandemic:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaK1gns-bV4    I would be extremely grateful for any donations you can offer to help relieve my current stressful situation.

Whether homeless or in desperate need  Humdingers is here to weekly provide hot meals in a warm and friendly environment to everyone that needs it. Our goal is to make a big difference in the lives of hundreds giving them the support they need.      Since beginning of 2020  we have distributed over 100 000 meals either during food collection or working with other local community organisations for drop offs in London. During the Covid-19 pandemic last year  Humdingers was providing 800 meals a week for the vulnerable and over 500 meals a day to the NHS front line workers  unfortunately this figure has increased this year to 1 000 meals a week. A figure that shouldn’t be the reality  but it is.       As a result of the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic  we have had an influx of people needing additional support. So  in 2021 we are expanding our Soup Kitchen facilities to a new site in Hornsey (picture below)  which is a huge project for us to financially take on alone  but we recognise the importance of being able to continue providing that much needed support to the vulnerable members of the community.       We have received a colossal amount of recognition for Humdingers Soup Kitchen  with the owner Rob Hunningher receiving a British Empire Medal  in The Queens Honours list October 2020. However  we need your help. The impact of Covid-19 has left a disastrous financial impression on us all  but most of all for those who were already on the edge and are not able to provide meals for themselves or their loved ones. From as little to as much as you can give  please donate so we are able to continue providing free meals for those in need and supporting the members of our community that vitally need our help.

She opened a pharmacy in Conakry  Guinea  years ago. She is well known and well established within her community. Everybody comes to her when they need medicine  medical assistance  financial assistance  a shoulder to cry on or just a good ear to listen; and the list goes on... She is always willing and ready to help in every way she can. Her pharmacy has become a safe place for the community. She is everyone’s mother. She always puts others and their needs before hers.    On Monday 8th March  as people began to post on social media celebrating IWD  my mum’s pharmacy was knocked down and part of her neighbourhood too. On that day the local government decided all buildings on that street needed to go  including the pharmacy with no prior warning. Luckily  the neighbourhood and the community stood up to the demolition team and the police to protect the medicines and help my mum secure her belongings. Thankfully  everything was packed and moved to my mum’s house safely. Nothing got destroyed apart from the walls. The people removed everything including the air conditioning.     Despite the chaos and panic  no one stole anything and they made sure she was ok. What is amazing in this is that the people came to help my mum  their mum despite having their homes and businesses being knocked down at the same time! They came to try to save her pharmacy  their safe place despite going through the same heartache. They chose her.... this is a complete testament to her generosity and the good she has done in her community.    My mum is going to be ok because we  her family  are here to support her and help her rebuild her pharmacy. However  who is going to help her community  her neighbourhood? They have nothing left and no one to help. I have been so compelled by this story and touched by people’s generosity towards my mum that I decided I needed to do something to thank them  but also help them rebuild their community.    Please join me in helping rebuild my mum’s community. We are all in each other’s lives  but in a moment  in just a tiny moment we can change somebody’s life.     Your donations big or small can make a huge difference. “Every little helps”.  Thank you very much for your support.  As Mother Theresa said  “Don’t worry about numbers. Help one person at a time and always start with the person nearest you.”    Some little background information:   The Guinean government decided to enlarge a lot of the roads to build pavements. This is the new project that will apparently revolutionise the city  which in principle might sound great if it was planned and well thought through  but again the lack of leadership and planning is impacting the people. A lot of families and businesses have been affected throughout the city  losing their homes and their livelihoods with no compensation or housing relocation plans. With a very limited insurance market and a country where people live on what they earn on a daily basis  people only have themselves to count on. There is no social support system at all.  This is not the first time the government oversaw demolitions in the city of Conakry with no form of redress. In 2019 and 2020  they brutally evicted and knocked down people’s homes and businesses in a different neighbourhood of the capital to make way for new embassies and government/business offices. According to the Human Rights Watch  more than 19 000 people were left homeless. The victims brought a case against the Guinean government at the Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The case is still open.
