We are committed to having the biggest possible impact for every person affected by a brain tumour, to defending the most amazing part of the human body, so that getting the diagnosis of a brain tumour no longer means a death sentence.  Brain tumours are different to other cancers, as they affect the part of you that makes you who you are.  Living with a brain tumour has a significant impact on quality of life, as evidenced through recent research, resulting in the publication of ‘Losing Myself: The Reality of Life with a Brain Tumour’. We believe that fighting brain tumours on all fronts through research, awareness and support is the only way to save lives, reduce long term disabilities and help everyone with a brain tumour and their families cope with everything that the diagnosis of a brain tumour brings.
