" HELP EXPAND OUR SOUP KITCHEN ","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/humdingers-soup-kitchen-expansion,15000,440,2021-05-13,2021-03-16,,,10,"2021-05-13 20/2021-05-11 150/2021-05-11 10/2021-05-10 50/2021-04-28 10/2021-03-31 100/2021-03-28 10/2021-03-23 50/2021-03-17 20/2021-03-16 20","Our sustainable Soup Kitchen is a community place for people needing support and food for themselves and their families. Whether homeless or in desperate need  Humdingers is here to weekly provide hot meals in a warm and friendly environment to everyone that needs it. Our goal is to make a big difference in the lives of hundreds giving them the support they need.      Since beginning of 2020  we have distributed over 100 000 meals either during food collection or working with other local community organisations for drop offs in London. During the Covid-19 pandemic last year  Humdingers was providing 800 meals a week for the vulnerable and over 500 meals a day to the NHS front line workers  unfortunately this figure has increased this year to 1 000 meals a week. A figure that shouldn’t be the reality  but it is.       As a result of the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic  we have had an influx of people needing additional support. So  in 2021 we are expanding our Soup Kitchen facilities to a new site in Hornsey (picture below)  which is a huge project for us to financially take on alone  but we recognise the importance of being able to continue providing that much needed support to the vulnerable members of the community.       We have received a colossal amount of recognition for Humdingers Soup Kitchen  with the owner Rob Hunningher receiving a British Empire Medal  in The Queens Honours list October 2020. However  we need your help. The impact of Covid-19 has left a disastrous financial impression on us all  but most of all for those who were already on the edge and are not able to provide meals for themselves or their loved ones. From as little to as much as you can give  please donate so we are able to continue providing free meals for those in need and supporting the members of our community that vitally need our help.     Join us in making a difference transforming entire communities for generations to come!      https://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/robert-hunningher-given-british-empire-medal-6538608    https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/nhs-staff-forgotten-covid-crisis-b900278.html    https://thebookofman.com/mind/masculinity/men-of-the-year/    ",False

Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland. Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen feed people seven days a week and will now be able to buy pallets of fresh produce to cook with  whilst the foodbank will be able to use the money to produce emergency three day food parcels.

We are currently feeding upto 150 people a week yhe homeless and stuggling families and residents but we desperately need funds to make this possible  there are so many people struggling on our streets the least we can do is give them a decent meal.    We will also be giving out care bags with toiletries sleeping bags and warm accessories.    So if you cant donate money we will happily accept any donations of new unwanted items.    Please remember these are Our Forgotten Neighbours and could happen to anyone of us.      Many Thanks    Victoria Springett and Vincent Barnett",False

This charity is very close to us all as we often pass by whilst around the university.     Feeling Strong MHC are an organisation who exist to make sure that every young person in Dundee who has experienced a mental health or wellbeing challenge is supported to reach their full potential. They deliver projects  services and campaigns in the community to tackle stigma  build confidence  develop resources  create networks and most importantly support the positive recovery journey of young people.    About us :    Abertay Football Club have 4 teams consisting of Men's 1st  2nd  3rd teams and Women's team also. We are very proud to have both Men's and Women's 1st teams in 1A - the highest division within Scottish university football.

Islay is a remote island of the West coast of Scotland with a population of 3500 people. The Covid-19 virus has hit island life hard with local businesses small and large having to close. The vulnerable and elderly are following Government guidelines meaning they are isolated in their homes . But  Islay is a strong community and we have over 80 volunteers that are helping to keep people’s physical and mental health strong by telephone befriending  collecting shopping  medicines and being a point of contact. Our newly formed resilience group coordinates the volunteers across the island reaching even the most remotest crofts and houses.        2.    We need a fund to:  Put fuel into the community bus  cover volunteer expenses  supply hand gel and gloves to our volunteers and eventually all households  and to cover admin and printing expenses. As the effects of the lock down persist  then we would like to provide people with a welfare box of essential items including food  kindling and toiletries.   Islay doesn't have access to mainland services so this fund is vital for us to get through the next few months.     3.    We visualise these funds being used in the immediate future for equipment to help the volunteers help the isolated but in the future weeks  we will need the fund to sustain the service and add a possible soup kitchen to enable the isolated to have two hot meals a day.    4.    The community of Islay  as we always do  has shown an excellent community spirit and will continue to pull together to ensure their neighbours who are isolated have everything they need to survive through this pandemic. Islay is resilient and will endeavour to push the barriers to make sure we will be open again for business as usual as soon as we can. This financial support will enable the immediate support of equipment  volunteers costs to be cover  offering hot meals to people at this hard time.    5.    You will be able to measure this through the huge smile and massive ‘socially distanced’ hug which comes through  helping a neighbour  friend or family member who is isolating and cant access their normal routine due to the pandemic. The number of volunteers is increasing every day  people as they have become unable to work have shown great support to help people who cannot leave their house.

As many of you know I absolutely love swimming in the sea.     So I've set myself a challenge to swim 100km in 100 days off the Roker & Seaburn coast. No wetsuit  no excuses!     Whatever the conditions I will swim everyday from 28th November 2020 until 7th March 2021 in water temperatures as low as 4'c    I will be documenting my journey on Instagram - Instagram name is 100daychallengeswimscsk if you'd like to follow and share.     How can you help? As part of this challenge I've also set myself the target of raising £1000 in aid of Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen.    Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen is a voluntary charity set up to combat hunger poverty - providing hot meals  free of charge to the homeless and the hungry every evening in Sunderland. They also provide food assistance  everyday essentials and clothing.    Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to me and those who use it.",False

We run Wakey Wakey cafe 52 Beverley road which provides     Free breakfast for rough sleepers in the morning and free tea  coffee  advice  activities and support throughout the day.    A food club for people on low income to purchase food at a much lower price  proofs of benefits or low income must be given.    Indoor Soup kitchens on certain nights.    We have also put rough sleepers up in hotels at Xmas for the past 2 years.    All money donated will go towards helping the above things happen and keep them going.    You can't just take someone from the street surrounded by people  put them in a room with just 4 walls and expect them to get on with it.

The Ju’/hoansi  the San people living in the Nyae Nyae Conservancy  now face a critical struggle against tuberculosis  a treatable and preventable disease.     This crowdfunder aims to raise money to support local efforts to beat this disease. The money raised will pay for projects which provide vital food  information and testing which is necessary to eliminate TB and support good recovery. The projects had a private funder  but she recently died  and government and NGOs have not picked up the funding shortfall. In addition  the collapse of tourism in the Nyae Nyae due to COVID19 has caused a major fall in local income  meaning this crowdfunder is more important than ever.       The San culture is under threat from many directions  but TB is particularly dangerous. It is the leading cause of death from any infectious disease worldwide and there are four strains of TB in the region. We’re working with organisations and doctors on the ground the Nyae Nyae to make sure this money gets to the right people at the right time.       The priority is to provide food for recovering TB patients as eating regular good food is essential for the treatment to work. Government funding pays for medicines distributed by the clinic in Tsumkwe  which serves the whole of the Nyae Nyae. However  this funding does not provide accommodation or food. There is a separate soup kitchen project which provides nutritious meals twice a day in Tsumkwe to TB patients  but it is facing massive funding cuts. The soup kitchen urgently requires £500 a month to continue to provide this vital service.     Funding is also desperately required for an outreach team that carries out testing and education in the remote villages. As we've learned from COVID19  testing is an important part of controlling infectious disease. The outreach team can identify the disease in the early stages  which limits the spread of infection within the villages. This outreach team requires £300 a month to operate.    Since TB flares up when people are malnourished or otherwise immuno-compromised  the longer term aim is to tackle food security. One vision to do this is to support the San to create gardens and food forests within each of the 39 villages in the Nyae Nyae Conservancy. Seeds  fencing materials and tree saplings are needed to establish a garden in each of them. If we exceed our fundraising target  the additional money will be put towards these gardens and forests.     If you are able to help fund this work in the longer term  please get in touch by contacting Caspar through the link below.       More on the San    The San people of the Kalahari are the last trace of our deep ancestry  our oldest cousins who never left Africa. Their territories span Botswana  Namibia and South Africa. In the last few centuries the nomadic lives these people led have been dramatically transformed through waves of colonialism and marginalisation that has put pressures on their land  and many are now settled in villages or only semi-nomadic.        Amongst the San are some of the best trackers and hunters in the world. Men and women can still walk into the bush with their digging sticks and come out with forage hides laden with food. However  their shrinking territory and the fact that they are settled in villages  means living off foraging and hunting alone is not enough. Money  necessary to supplement limited hunting and foraging  is hard to come by. The main sources of income are searching in the desert for the Devil’s Claw plant and tourism. With COVID19  it will be a long time before tourism returns to the Kalahari.     About us    We are a group of people passionate about supporting the Ju'/hoansi as many of us have spent time with them through the Old Way and / or Wildwise over the last few years. There is so much we can learn from a culture as old as humanity itself and we would love to support the people who shared so much with us. Your kindness means the world to us  thank you.

Zimbabwe is not spared  having recorded our first case rising to 3 As we post this. We have one confirmed death  and one death is already one too many. We believe the numbers are more than this and its just a matter of time before the situation explodes. Our health system is broken and definitely not ready. But again we are called to ACTION  to help wherever we can. In most cases the homeless community is always ignored as already experienced. There has not been any awareness amongst this community  soup kitchens around town have closed down  they don't have any access to healthcare facilities. With the lockdown being effected by the government - do we even think of where they will go? What they will eat? And how will they get treated if they contract the virus.

We are so grateful and have put this money to such good use  with feedback from our homeless friends saying that the packages are so beneficial  protective and make a big difference! <3 <3 We are now setting a new target to double this money so we can keep doing the important work we are but also diversify to help out refugee services groups in the UK! Lots of love to everyone       Hi all  I hope this finds you  and everyone you love  safe and well supported. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak in the UK  new measures are being taken to limit the amount of mass gatherings and group meetings.    As a result  there is talk of soup kitchens  homeless shelters and regular meeting spots shutting  leaving some of our most vulnerable and at risk groups losing their regular access to designated food  shelter and safety spots; and social activities  leaving them without supplies and more isolated then ever before The creation of out-reach packages with non-perishable food and drink supplies  tissues  hand sanitation/wipes  and masks is essential  to supply to individuals who will now not be able to access these things in the places they could before. Moreover  as a medical student myself  we have been granted a large period of time without full academic commitments  where we have the time to go and make these deliveries and offer the support we can  during this time  where self-isolating isn't an option for some people.    Please donate whatever you can  and share this page with as many people as possible (especially those who work within larger companies and are able to circulate it around there). From there we can start to create packages and begin delivering them. Moreover if anyone has contact with food and/or supply companies who would be willing to ask for item donations  that would be amazing too.    My email is [email redacted]   Please get in touch with any questions and/or ideas/ concerns  and if you want to help out with this  that would be so helpful and beneficial.    Love and good vibes       Nazia ",False

Amazing Graze is a soup kitchen providing meals and support to the homeless community in Blackpool. Part of Network Rail’s ‘Routes out of Homelessness’ charitable focus  the funds raised by the sleep-out will go directly towards helping to feed and support the homeless community in Blackpool. Chris is a relief signaller for Network Rail at Bamber Bridge  near Preston  with a passion for helping people living on the streets. When he’s not signalling trains  he can be found leading a team of volunteers who scour the streets of Blackpool looking for rough sleepers. He started his Thursday night ‘community watch’ street walks last year. Already he has up to 40 volunteers in tow  all decked out in Chris’ ‘United Blackpool' hoodies. Since starting his street walks  Chris has helped get 12 homeless people off the streets and into rented accommodation. He works with Blackpool charity Amazing Graze  running the local soup kitchen on Friday nights. Please email [email redacted].uk for more information. ",False

Spin City Newbury actually closed before this request was announced as we felt the health and safety of our instructors and students needed to come first. As many can imagine  closing the doors to the business has been very difficult and emotional for us all. Unfortunately this has become even more difficult over the last few weeks when after exhausting all options available to us  it has become clear Spin City will not be entitled to any government help.     Spin City Newbury offers a range fitness classes including Pole  Silks  Aerial Hoop and Yoga  but Spin City is more than just a fitness studio. The studio offers a community where our students feel accepted. Students don't just come for the fitness classes  they come to meet new friends and take time away from the stress that is general life. Many students find that the studio helps their mental health and that the sense of achievement that naturally comes with our classes can help focus on a positive attitude towards health and fitness.     Spin City also has always possessed a strong desire to help the local community. Last year it held it's first summer ball where just short of £3000 was raised and donated to Mind  Berkshire Women’s Aid and Newbury Cancer Care. At the time of closing Spin City Newbury had just started organising this years ball with the intention of beating this huge amount. Along with this  Spin City regularly held Pole and Aerial 'jams' where students could come along after donating money to local soup kitchens/charities.     Katy and the entire Spin City team have always had a fiercely positive attitude  but at the moment the future isn't as positive. As a team we have started thinking of ways that we can adapt in these difficult and unprecedented times to allow us to get back into the studio teaching the classes our students love so much!    There are a few ways in which people can support and keep the studio alive.   There is the Spin City Patreon (Remember to put Spin City Newbury as your studio) This is pre recorded content that you can add together to build your own workouts. Memberships start at £10 per month and the proceeds are helping to support the studio while our doors are closed.   We will also be launching some specific classes which you can join in at home - details are being finalised at the moment  but we hope that this will bridge the gap for those wanting to workout at home but need a bit more motivation from an instructor for the class.   And lastly there is this crowd funder. This is aimed at anyone who would like to help support us  but isn't interested in getting lessons in return.   Anything you can donate is hugely appreciated and absolutely everything will be going into paying for the studio while we all are staying at home  staying safe and protecting the NHS.     From all of the team at Spin City Newbury - Thank you for your support.",False

Hi all. I'd normally be working on the wards at our local hospital in Newbury (WBCH) but am currently in isolation due to previous medical problems that put me in the extremely clinically vulnerable group. I am therefore feeling a bit useless at the moment. I have done a little fundraising for the hospital as have a lot of people in this area so have now decided I'd like to raise money for our local soup kitchen in Newbury and also The Living Rainforest which due to it's closure to the public during this time  needs money to pay for the food and upkeep of their animals and birds.  People who know me know that my rather unruly hair is kind of like my trademark. I am recognised easily for it. Some people don't know however that I have been completely without hair due to treatment for leukaemia 29 yrs ago and that I have had 2 small trims in the last 20+ years as it takes FOREVER to grow. Hence my entering into this with some trepidation to say the least  that and due to the lock down  my partner Shaun will be doing the honours (Gulp!!).  Any money raised here will be split 50/50 between the 2 beneficiaries. I am raising it like this as The living Rain forest isn't a charity so I can't do it that way.  I hope you will support me by watching it as it's live streamed on facebook (if i can suss out how to do it by then!) as well as by giving generously so that Newbury Soup Kitchen can continue to support the local homeless people and so that the Living Rain Forest will still be there for you to be able to visit Cinnamon the Sloth and the other animals and birds when we are back to whatever ""normal"" is.   Thank you in advance.  Lynne XXX",False

Why am I doing this?     We are incredibly fortunate in the UK to have high standards of living  in comparison to other areas of the world. We have an education system  health facilities and a freedom of speech that other countries simply don’t have.    I don’t want to go into another country and tell its residents how to live. I want to visit communities and share my knowledge  experiences and use my skills to help others.     I didn’t just wake up one morning wanting to do this. It has come from a lifetime of travelling and interacting with different communities around the globe.     I recently went travelling in The Gambia in West Africa. I visited a number of different communities and spoke to them about the struggles that they face on a day-to-day basis. I spoke to women about how they were viewed in comparison to men and how they had to stay at home while the male family members went to school/work and witnesses the frightened faces when AIDS/HIV was discussed because they didn’t understand it or how to stop it.   I also visited villages that have no water or electricity  but seemed so much happier than a lot of people in the western world who by comparison have it all.    How am I going to do this?    I didn’t just want to raise money through fundraising activities. The problem with that is you can’t always guarantee that the money you give to a charity will go directly to the people you want to help and support.    I made the tough decision to pack up my things and to go on a journey to help others in some of the worlds most deprived countries.    Following hours of research  I discovered International Volunteer HQ and Original Volunteers that works closely with NGOs across the globe. They identify where help is most needed and source volunteers with the right skills who can make a tangible difference in those areas.    After more research I found more organisations who can help me on my quest to make a real difference. Please see my itinerary below…    My itinerary    My first stop is Goa  India  whilst in Goa I will be working with the charity ‘Volunteer in Goa’ supporting local orphanages and animals.    From Goa I will travel Bengaluru to be involved in a women’s empowerment project with the Sankalp Volunteer Group.    My last stop in India is Chennai  helping women with learning disabilities alongside Original Volunteers.    After six months in India I will be flying to Cambodia for 3 months to work on community development  human rights  HIV & AIDs awareness  gender and environmental issues with International volunteer HQ (IVHQ).    After Cambodia I will cross the border to Vietnam to work on a project that focuses on feeding the homeless through local soup kitchens for 2 months.    I love animals  so through POD Volunteer I will be working in a dog and cat rescue sanctuary in Thailand.    I will then visit Kampala in Uganda for 20 weeks to help with women’s education  HIV and AIDS support and numerous construction and renovation initiatives.     Two months in Tanzania will consist of HIV and AIDS support in the local community.    My penultimate destination will be Zambia for another two months. Whilst there I will be delivering care to elderly residents and community development.    My two year trip will conclude with a 20 week programme in Ghana teaching childcare and agriculture.

With all that is happening in the news about the refugee situation in Calais we feel stirred  like many  to respond in some way. Some of us have already visited the site where people are living in a a difficult conditions. It’s a big  complex situation and we simply want to reach out to other human beings and do the little we can. Lots of little jigsaw pieces add up to a bigger picture!    So our ‘jigsaw’ piece is a soup kitchen.    We will be travelling to the ‘Jungle’ in Calais on Saturday 5th December to serve soup and bread to as many as we can. Advice is 'come with plenty' so we are aiming for a 1000 portions.  We have a large  simple  mobile kitchen that we have used for other outdoor events that we will take with us then set up a few gazebos and serve.   We have 18 and counting volunteers and and we are networking with people on the ground in Calais to make sure this helps  not hinders  operations there.     our costs involve:-    *the hire of a van to transport the kitchen and food    *the food itself    *disposable cups with lids    Please join with us in making this possible. Not everyone can physically go but with your donations we can all do something to help.  THANK YOU",False

As an independent volunteer here in Greece the most important thing I've been able to do is provide aid in crisis situations exactly at the time it was needed. That is why it is very important for independents to be here. To fill in gaps. You see NGOs  because of the way they are set up  although they have the funding and the resources  their hands are tied by a million different rules and regulations  which stops them from being able to react quickly to crisis.         But independent volunteers work differently. They arrive  they assess the needs and they provide direct aid as and when it is needed. This can mean doing a midnight run to the super market and buying 2000 croissants because the borders are closed and 80 buss loads of hungry and cold people are stuck at a gas station. Or driving a van full of equipment  for 6 hours   to set up a portable soup kitchen next to said gas station. It means arriving at 4am with tents and sleeping bags  making sure children and vulnerable people don't sleep in the open air in the middle of winter. It means being able to fly a very sick child to a mainland hospital in the middle of the night. And so much more.         But for this to happen we need funding. Money that can be accessed immediately. We need to be able to respond quickly. And we need your help. After nearly 3 months here I have had the absolute privilege of meeting and working with some of the most incredible human beings for whom personal safety and comfort is secondary to the welfare of others. They don't stop. They work 17 hour shifts in the cold or the heat  at the beaches  at the borders  in the towns. They pitch tents in the middle of a field with a gas cooker and make tea or soup  anything to provide warmth and comfort. They take over abandoned buildings and renovate it and turn it into safe spaces where people can eat and sleep and get much needed relief from their relentless suffering.         If you think this work is important and would like to offer your support  please donate generously. Tell your friends and family about it. It's because of your care and trust in us that we are able to do what we do.                                             What we need money for:    To hire vans  we need to buy kitchen equipment  food  blankets  sleeping bags  tents and everything else people need to survive the cold and the inhumane conditions forced on them by this situation.      100% of your donation will go toward providing relief to the refugees. We do not discriminate between war refugees and economic migrants. We do not differentiate between different nationalities. We only priorotise based on who has the greatest need.

This campaign started as an October 2020 half-term project to supply 1000 packed lunches to vulnerable children in South Essex  and we raised nearly £1 800 on top of what we needed to get these lunches made. Because of the government's recent announcement that they are going to increase funding for the provision of 'free school meals' over the school holidays (well done Marcus Rashford!)  we have decided to use the additional money and hopefully loads more to make sure that lots of children in Essex have gifts to open on Christmas morning.    Like many hospitality businesses in England  we are closed until December 2nd 2020 and we're going to be brutally honest - financially we are struggling. However  across the UK the pandemic has led to many  many families struggling as well. While we are trying our hardest to stay afloat  a heartbreaking number of parents are going into Winter juggling keeping their children fed and their homes warm. You don't need to be an expert economist to realise that even a small amount of festive magic could be out of reach for many.    This is why we want to help  and we are going to do this in a Covid-friendly manner. We are working with a number of local organisations who already have the facilities in place to safely get the gifts to those who really need them  including One Love Soup Kitchen in Southend and Lennox Children's Cancer Fund who work with Essex families with children who are in and out of hospital receiving cancer treatment. This list of partner groups will expand in the weeks ahead.

Job Losses  Financial Impact  Mental Health  Isolation and for many Homelessness.    For the past couple of year  I’ve said I’d go out and do my little bit to help those less fortunate during Christmas and this year being the horror show that it was I decided no excuses  it’s getting done. I took to Amazon  purchased items such as Hats  Gloves  Socks and some other little essentials and made up 20 care packages coupled with some packed lunches  nothing extravagant… sandwiches  chocolate  some fruit and a few other bits and bobs.    The difference that made to people who were out on the street  sleeping rough  homeless  in temporary Accomodation or who have a house but are out begging to try and make enough to get their heat and electricity on for a day. I have seen these people. I have spoken to these people.    I knew after doing it I was hooked  not for the good feeling it gives you when you help others (just being honest…it does) but for the simple fact that there are a group of vulnerable people within the homeless and rough sleeping community who do not use the services of organisations such as soup kitchens for one reason or another. They vary but I am not there to judge. A lot of rough sleepers do not want to be hooked to substances and drink so going to a location with 100+ individuals who they may know  have history with and could tempt them isn’t a great idea  so they avoid it and are deprived of the support and network of a lot of amazing people.    So  where do my friends and I come into this?    We go into the City Centre 3 times a week (if we can) sometimes its two. We look for people who are begging or out sleeping rough and engage with them  try to understand their situation and then we provide them with a food parcel  a warm drink  and the most important thing of all our time. We chat to them.    Ideally  we aim to help around 10 people per night  we have around 6-7 regular people we go to visit  and we just know where they will be.    We are currently funding everything ourselves weekly but would love to be in a position where we have a fund there to help mitigate the cost of the food and consumables. I’ve roughly calculated that approx. £6k allows us to do this for the full year at a basic level as we are doing.    This is where I hope you can come in to help. Even sharing this will be a huge help but should you be able to donate anything (and I mean anything... 50p…£1 anything then it would be greatly appreciated.    I am also happy to hear from anyone who may have items they no longer need such as Jackets  Trousers  Socks  Hats  Gloves  Scarves  Sleeping Bags  Rucksacks  Boots.... I am happy to come and collect items from anyone who has anything they feel would be ideal to donate. I believe there is a contact organiser function on this page.    We are not an organisation; we are not a charity we are just a few people who understand there is a group of vulnerable people within a larger group of vulnerable people and we just wish to play our little part alongside all the other fantastic people out there.

It is deathly quiet and with no tourists spending money in our little village  the weeks or months (who knows!) ahead are going to get even tougher…  It is extremely difficult to help families and ‘choose’ who is more ‘in need’…   A large number of residents have been retrenched  restaurants have had to close  no curios  bracelets  cashew nuts  R&R’s or sim cards are being sold and there is currently not much hope on the horizon.    To create a SUSTAINABLE solution (and to try and be fair to everyone) we would like to open up a SOUP KITCHEN.  This will ensure that anyone who is hungry can get a nutritious meal  including a bread roll (pão) daily.  We aim to run this initiative for ±2 months when hopefully some type of 'normality' will return to Malongane.    This fundraiser will be overseen by the Malongane Community Association (a fully registered organisation) which will provide accountability and oversee exactly where the money is being spent. A full breakdown of costs will be published each week on their Facebook page.  The soup kitchen is being supported by a number of Malongane businesses (and individuals) who are donating their time  resources and skills to help put this together.    There are ±20 families in Malongane who are in desperate need. These families will be identified by the community via a community meeting and they will receive additional assistance where required.     Any donations towards our soup kitchen will be greatly appreciated.  We hope to welcome you back to Ponta Malongane very soon.    ",False

Unfortunately for us the service was designed to maximise social contact for those most vulnerable in our communities who were feeling lonely  isolated and invisible. As a result of the current pandemic we have had to move away from that model and adapt it so as to limit social contact while still providing the basic essentials.

They have been exploited  persecuted and displaced for many hundreds of years  and have experienced enormous hardship.    It has become increasingly difficult for the San Bushmen to continue to practice their traditional way of life as hunter-gatherers and now only fifteen active master trackers remain. The situation today is an urgent and critical one; we now have precious time left to help preserve this most ancient way of life and the wisdom they hold.     In March 2020 I will journey deep into the Kalahari Desert to this remote tribe with WildWise in association with The Old Way and CyberTracker. Our small group are all graduates from the WildWise “Call of the Wild ” programme and we will travel to the part of the desert which is the last place in Africa where they still retain rights to their ancestral lands  where they are still able to hunt with a bow and arrow and where the community still remain with some of their traditional ways of life intact.    Living among the Ju/‘Hoansi  we will immerse ourselves in their way of life  experiencing the way they live together in community  raise their children  and going out in small groups at dawn tracking with the bow hunting master trackers.       Why we need this original wisdom    Being the longest continuous intact human culture affords the San Bushpeople a unique intelligence missing in the modern world. They retain a deep inter-connection with the land and it gives them an exceptional and astounding ability to read the earth for stories and track and trail animals for days. This is a continuous tradition that goes back more than 100 000 years  the longest of any human tradition. Their skills and way of life are a vital source of information about human evolution and how to live in deep connection to the living world.    This older  deeper wisdom is lacking from our world right now but through it we might find the distant tracks of some of the answers to the profound questions and challenges the world is facing.    But just when we need it most  the opportunity to experience it is diminishing due to the long-standing persecution and displacement that the San have faced. This has made it impossible for the San to sustain this way of living.    It is my view that preserving this ancient culture that once supported all human life is as critical as saving the last 15 of any species on earth.     The time to act is now.    How the invitation came about    This invitation came from the Ju/‘Hoansi Bushpeople themselves. I am fully aware of the trap which many Western organisations fall into of thinking they know what’s best for other communities. Our primary guide is the renowned anthropologist  scientist and founder of CyberTracker Louis Liebenberg. Louis has been working with the Bushpeople in the Kalahari since 1985  and being a true master tracker himself is highly respected and trusted.    He was asked by the elders of the tribe in 1990 to help them to pass on their cultural practices to the younger generation who have abandoned the traditional ways of living because it is no longer a viable way to survive within the constraints forced upon them. Louis has been tirelessly working with the San Bushmen to ensure that their invaluable tracking expertise is passed on to the younger generation by reviving the ancient practice of tracking as a way to sustain life within the community.    By using free and easy-to-use software designed by CyberTracker  trackers are able to record complex data about wildlife populations and plant biodiversity. By becoming ‘qualified’ as trackers they are able to get jobs in ecotourism  as rangers in anti-poaching units  in wildlife monitoring and scientific research.    This programme of employment creation is vital to ensure that their invaluable tracking expertise is passed on to the younger generation of San by incentivising and motivating them to keep their knowledge and skills alive.        How the money will be used    1 - Money you offer will go directly to supporting the San communities. It will be a lifeline of employment for them whilst also encouraging them to continue their ancient and important cultural practices. This trip will support all the 15 remaining master trackers (three of whom are women!) in the Namibian conservancy for 4 months of the year. We pay them in one week what it takes them 2 or 3 months to earn picking the devil’s claw plant; which is their only other source of income.

It has unlocked for me an intense longing to be reminded of the wisdom that my ancestors held and their connection to their communities and the earth. What does it mean to re-wild ourselves and the communities we live in? Is it possible to bridge the modern world and all that it offers with an older  wilder way of being? How can I share this passion and this greater wisdom with others that crave a deeper connection with life?

The Old Way     If this is something you would like to personally experience and support  then it is possible to join a similar trip journeying into the Kalahari with “The Old Way” which is a year-long program exploring hunter-gatherer life ways which takes place in Devon and the Kalahari.    More about the San Bushpeople    It is thought likely that the Bushmen are the descendants of the ancestral source  from which all modern humans diverged as they started spreading around the world about 60 000 years ago. Their cultural practices date back 100 000 years - all human beings once lived in this original way. It still lives deep in all of us.    Like all indigenous cultures the San have been subject to long-standing persecution and pressures from all sides. It is extraordinary that the people and their culture has been able to persist. Hunter-gathering by its very nature relies on an ability to roam great distances to source the food they need. Today their ancestral lands are divided up into farms and given away to diamond miners; the small areas left ‘designated’ for the bushmen are not compatible with their way of life. They have been evicted  starved of food and water and hunted like animals. Most San have now been resettled to camps  where disease and alcoholism is rife. It is a far cry from their traditional ways that work in harmony with the land living in community. Something so many of us seem to be striving for today as a way out of the ecological crisis we find ourselves in.    Somehow  against the odds a small number of San Bushmen persist in living according to their ancient traditions. It is thought that the number is now around 10-15 individuals and this number is declining. It is very likely that if nothing changes their way of life will be lost forever in the next few years  a human extinction that will go unnoticed. I don’t want to sit passively to let that happen.    This is why new ways of supporting the San are vital  so that they continue to value their traditional ways  passing them on to their young people so that they might keep alive a culture from which all human life originated.",False

They have been exploited  persecuted and displaced for many hundreds of years  and have experienced enormous hardship.    It has become increasingly difficult for the San Bushmen to continue to practice their traditional way of life as hunter-gatherers and now only fifteen active master trackers remain. The situation today is an urgent and critical one; we now have precious time left to help preserve this most ancient way of life and the wisdom they hold.     In March 2020 I will journey deep into the Kalahari Desert to this remote tribe with WildWise in association with The Old Way and CyberTracker . Our small group are all graduates from the WildWise “Call of the Wild ” programme and we will travel to the part of the desert which is the last place in Africa where they still retain rights to their ancestral lands  where they are still able to hunt with a bow and arrow and where the community still remain with some of their traditional ways of life intact.    Living among the Ju/‘Hoansi  we will immerse ourselves in their way of life  experiencing the way they live together in community  raise their children  and going out in small groups at dawn tracking with the bow hunting master trackers.       Why we need this original wisdom    Being the longest continuous intact human culture affords the San Bushpeople a unique intelligence missing in the modern world. They retain a deep inter-connection with the land and it gives them an exceptional and astounding ability to read the earth for stories and track and trail animals for days. This is a continuous tradition that goes back more than 100 000 years  the longest of any human tradition. Their skills and way of life are a vital source of information about human evolution and how to live in deep connection to the living world.    This older  deeper wisdom is lacking from our world right now but through it we might find the distant tracks of some of the answers to the profound questions and challenges the world is facing.    But just when we need it most  the opportunity to experience it is diminishing due to the long-standing persecution and displacement that the San have faced. This has made it impossible for the San to sustain this way of living.    It is my view that preserving this ancient culture that once supported all human life is as critical as saving the last 15 of any species on earth.     The time to act is now.    How the invitation came about    This invitation came from the Ju/‘Hoansi Bushpeople themselves. I am fully aware of the trap which many Western organisations fall into of thinking they know what’s best for other communities. Our primary guide is the renowned anthropologist  scientist and founder of CyberTracker Louis Liebenberg. Louis has been working with the Bushpeople in the Kalahari since 1985  and being a true master tracker himself is highly respected and trusted.    He was asked by the elders of the tribe in 1990 to help them to pass on their cultural practices to the younger generation who have abandoned the traditional ways of living because it is no longer a viable way to survive within the constraints forced upon them. Louis Liebenberg has been tirelessly working with the San Bushmen to ensure that their invaluable tracking expertise is passed on to the younger generation by reviving the ancient practice of tracking as a way to sustain life within the community.    By using free and easy-to-use software designed by CyberTracker  trackers are able to record complex data about wildlife populations and plant biodiversity. By becoming ‘qualified’ as trackers they are able to get jobs in ecotourism  as rangers in anti-poaching units  in wildlife monitoring and scientific research.    This programme of employment creation is vital to ensure that their invaluable tracking expertise is passed on to the younger generation of San by incentivising and motivating them to keep their knowledge and skills alive.      How the money will be used    1 - Money you offer will go directly to supporting the San communities. It will be a lifeline of employment for them whilst also encouraging them to continue their ancient and important cultural practices. This trip will support all the 15 remaining master trackers in the Namibian conservancy for 4 months of the year. We pay them in one week what it takes them 2 or 3 months to earn picking the devil’s claw plant; which is their only other source of income. The tracking work provides a valued source of income which helps preserve their culture and unique scientific knowledge; The Tracker qualification programme in turn helps to support the livelihoods of the village as a whole.    2 - We will pay the other villagers such as the elders & youth who provide valuable knowledge and host us and help us with various tasks around camp.    3 - We also provide financial support through the purchase of handicrafts which provides a crucial source of income for the women as there is next to no potential employment for them in this region. This again supports a wide number of villages as well as helping them to preserve their heritage craft skills. The women will also be paid to teach us to build grass huts for us to sleep in which  like the handicrafts  provides a crucial source of income for the women as well as preserving the knowledge and skill set to build our species first kinds of homes.    4 - We pay an entrance fee to the conservancy  translators and apprentice translators.    5 - Subject to having enough money leftover and if external funds are not forthcoming from elsewhere then we will also provide funding for food for people coming to the TB soup kitchen in Tsumkwe  the clinic is thus able to stay open for longer and provide a better service; we supplement the funding of the clinic provided by others.

We are aiming to raise £2000 in a short period of just two weeks to ensure that each and every family in Hartlepool who are in need of a little help at Christmas receive a Christmas gift. Can you imagine  as you sit at home this evening surrounded by your Children who have probably already written their Christmas lists and sent them off to Santa not receiving a single gift on Christmas morning? Unfortunately this is a reality for families in our home town but YOU can change that by making a donation. I am going to be working very closely with Childrens Services at Hartlepool Borough Council to ensure that we target families that are most in need. I may be slightly ambitious here but the hope is the target will be smashed and and any funds left over will be given to the local soup kitchen and food bank in their 'leaner' months of January and February.    A local business man who wants to remain completely anonymous came up with the idea of 'The Nothing But Love' campaign. Wanting to give something back for absolutely zero in return he wanted to give a £1000 of his own cash to go to local families who are in genuine need but without any 'thanks' or shouting from the rooftops just wanting to do a selfless  good dead. The idea of the 'Nothing But Love' Campaign was born.    So of course want to donate  right? Well  here is the catch - You give COMPLETELY ANONYMOUSLY. That's right  you get absolutely nothing in return other than the warm glow inside of knowing you have done a truly brilliant thing. We ask that if you donate to the page you just pop your initials in rather than your name. We like to think of it as people helping people. We are hoping that local business people will look to donate very generously. If you are unable to donate if you could share the Facebook page with anyone who you think may be able to support that would be very much appreciated.    Thank you for taking the time to read and please help me spread the word to ensure we make it the best Christmas we can for everyone in our local community.

She has also lost a good part of her short term memory. Joan is confined to a wheelchair as she can not walk on her own. She has a caregiver who comes daily to care for her.     Sadly Joan has just been forced into homelessness and is temporarily living in a motel in Kelso  Washington. This happened just after Christmas because she was short rent money but didn’t want to ask for help as it was Christmastime. Sadly she was evicted and didn’t realise the implications and the cruelness the landlord would show them. Now she will have great difficulties finding a landlord that will accept her because that eviction is on her record.     My nephew Joshua  who has learning difficulties  also lives with my sister. Joshua takes care of his mom at night when her caregiver is not able to be there. He also has a job at the local McDonalds that he's very proud of as it's so hard for him to get a job with his difficulties. Unfortunately  because Joshua is an adult  he was made to be on the lease for the apartment as well. This means unfortunately that the eviction is on his record too.     Joshua’s young son  my great nephew Oliver  lives with them as well. He’s a bright kid that is the star football player for his school. Oliver helps look after his grandma too and he just adores her.     The three of them are sharing a handicap room and sadly the boys are sleeping on the floor.     Becoming homeless  let alone my sisters stroke  has affected them all something terrible and they are stuck! They are good people who’ve never drank  smoked or been anywhere near drugs.   My sister and nephews are the kind of people who would give you the shirt off their backs.     My sister was a stay at home grandma. She’s raised my great nephew Oliver when he was abandoned by his mother at 3 months old.   Joan used to make cookies and bake all the time and boy could she crochet! Her blankets and scarves were so beautiful!   She also used to volunteer at a local church who ran a soup kitchen. That came to an end when she fell off a pallet in 2014 whilst volunteering and broke her hip! Only a few months after this she had her stroke. Joan has had a horrible run of luck and I just want to turn it around for her and really show her how much everyone cares!     My sister receives very little help from the state and doesn’t get housing just because she’s a disabled stroke victim as most would assume. My great nephew is obviously a minor but the government doesn’t provide quick assistance for this reason either unfortunately.     They have applied to the local housing authority for subsidised housing but the waiting list is two years! Things are so different in the USA compared to the UK. The government WILL NOT help them!     We have exhausted all efforts  called all the shelters and spoken to the local churches. It seems so many people are in this position in the USA that no one has the ability to help!     Please help raise money for Joan and my sweet nephews to have a safe place to stay for the time being. The money will be going towards keeping them in the handicap room for now so my sister can be comfortable and close to her caregiver. Any additional money will be saved for a deposit for an appropriate home for them and any essentials they require.     If anyone knows of a landlord in Kelso or Longview that is willing to help them please let me know. We really need a miracle to happen! With your support and spreading the word hopefully we can find something for them soon!     Anything you can give now will be much appreciated. Even £5! Please share with everyone you know! Thank you all so much in advance!",False

My mum and I are creating food hampers for people in the nearby community of Masiphumelele who have no food  and no income at the moment during our Coronavirus Lockdown. The lockdown is preventing any work for them  and its not easy (near impossible) for them to access anything from the system. There are millions of people here who are in the same situation so its very difficult.    We have been creating weekly essential food hampers for 14 Zimbabwean Families who are not receiving anything from anyone. They all have 4-6 people to feed in each household (sometimes more) and they have no income at all coming in. Winter is approaching  and while we sit inside at our warm fireplaces with full tummies  they are going to be in a very different reality. The families so far are all friends with the guy who works full time for our family. He is Zimbabwean and lives on our property  so he is safe  paid and fed well of course. We asked him a few weeks ago if he had friends/knew any other people directly who were going to be really without food  and he identified 11 Zimbabwean contacts. It grew to 13  and now 14 and while we will continue to do this for them  we would like to grow and be able to a) give them a bit more in their hampers to make it a real good week’s supply  and b) to increase it ultimately to 20 families that we can support. Our focus at the moment is on the Zimbabwean families who are having a very hard time accessing some of the soup kitchens/food parcels  and we acknowledge that this a problem for many other nationalities and groups. My mum is from Zimbabwe  so its a cause close to her heart.    We know there are always more people  but if we can just start with a few  then at least that is making a small difference.     This lockdown life is a very different reality for everyone. Lots of us are worried about not being able to exercise properly  worried about eating too much from our overstocked fridges and pantries  burning our banana breads  and getting bored of the Netflix offerings.     Others are literally struggling to survive.     Any donations that we receive will be spent directly on creating essential food hampers  to increase what we are already contributing ourselves. We will distribute directly to these people once a week. (We have organised transport for it to be delivered directly to them  and I receive photos and messages of thanks from all the families)    We have a VERY weak exchange rate here in SA  so I appeal especially to my friends living outside SA- to donate even a little bit  as here it can go a very long way! Maybe its your saving of daily Starbucks/Costa Coffees that you aren’t able to buy anymore  or the savings of not going to the pub :) or maybe is just your generous nature  that will be very appreciated!      To feed a family of 4 with very basic weekly supplies  can be done with R200-R250  which works out to approx 9-12Pounds per hamper. (would also be good to increase the contents/value to broaden the variety and quantity). The more we can raise  the more families we can feed  and we can also hopefully help them with a little bit of money for electricity for their houses  which is another big problem! We need to continue this for the foreseeable future  as we don’t know how long we will be in various levels of lockdown and until they will be able to find some work to support themselves again  so we really will appreciate all donations to be able to sustain and importantly  to grow this.   Its never-ending...    We have also made and distributed fabric masks to these families and others  as its now law to have to wear masks in public. The mask production continues (my mum and her friends) and we will keep donating these to as many people as we can. They are using old cotton fabric that they have either been hoarding for years  or upcycling spare linen into masks.      Thank you very much for your time.   Stay Safe and Healthy.

All across London  there are people who won't have a warm meal at any point over the next few weeks because as usual  shops and restaurants shut down and people will have to rely on soup kitchens  food banks and any other resources available to them.    I'd like to collect funds to be able to cook and deliver meals to those who live on the streets and with your help I'll be able to do so. I will be using a commercial kitchen and premises to prepare a variety of soups  sandwiches and nibbles. Don't worry I have my food hygiene certificate handy :-)    I've been lucky to be provided access to a commercial kitchen where I can cook in large batches of food. With this I'll deliver everything I can to various food banks  soup kitchens and charities across London.    Any money raised will be used to purchase the ingredients needed for the meals  and any left over money will be used to create kits that would contain items such as hats  socks  scarves and personal hygiene items.    If you can't donate money  then maybe you select a few pieces of clothes that don't fit (Thanks lockdown!)? and even if you don't then sharing this would also help!

Also  I have heard stories about many working class parents who have lost their jobs during the recent pandemic and now have no means of buying food to support their families.

I will do a 2 mile run every day in different locations around Preston and Blackpool. I know  2 miles isn’t very far but as my knees are damaged from playing competitive badminton for nearly 35 years it will be a challenge for me. I will take photos along the route and snap shots of my location on google maps.    You can decide how your donation will be spent:-    Option 1: PPE for the medical and care workers  Option 2: Shelter and Soup Kitchen.

We operate from a rented building in our town center which is now being sold. This fund raising is to enable us to purchase this building which has become a community centerand is currently used for the following projects:  1. ROC Cafe.   Thi is a youth drop in project which provides healthy diversionary activities for young people in order to reduce anti-social behaviour which is not unconnected of the problem of legal highs in our town. We have from 6 to 50 young people who come to our building weekly for this and have had great success on the project.  Beyond the reducing figures  young people are at the heart of the ROC Cafe project! We place high value on each young person and invest in them in the provision of positive activities and great opportunities.  2. Soup kitchen  The homeless and less fortunate are fed from our building 3 times a week.  3. Street Pastors.  The Street Pastors base is within our building from where the street pastors go out for their patrols weekly.   4. Community celebrations &  5. Religious worship    The total Purchase price of the building is £400 000.

I have been engaging with clients who are homeless  but also on the verge of being homeless. I feel very passionate about the work our service do and I have been inspired to start a project throughout 2021.     On the 13th of September 2021  I will be travelling to Snowdonia to reach the top of the Snowdon Mountain – Via the Miners track. Total climb: 723M (2  372ft). This will be my solo challenge to raise funds for this rewarding project.     The most severe and visible form of homelessness is rough sleeping. Official estimates show more than 4 000 people are sleeping rough in England a night. This is set to increase due to the financial pressures from the current pandemic. Many have been placed into temporary accommodation since the last lockdown  but there has also been a small rise of unaccounted street homeless throughout the UK.     Current statistics on homelessness show –     7% have served in the armed forces.     33% of females have fled domestic violence and became homeless.     45% have been diagnosed with a mental health condition.     43% need support for substance misuse.     12% have been in the care system.     The money I raise through the challenging climb will fund a number of life-saving survivor packs for rough sleepers next winter. I know it won’t be possible to provide enough for everyone  but your donation will help me support as much of Somerset as possible.     The survivor packs will include –     • Greggs coupon   • Warm socks  hat  and gloves.   • Toothpaste and brush.   • Re-usable water bottle.   • Cereal bars.   • Plasters   • Ear plugs   • Lip balm   • Wet wipes/Tissues   • Sanitary towels   • Local service information – Soup kitchens  Service support  Council offices  GP access  etc.   I would also try to supply as many sleeping bags as possible to different agencies who do a fantastic job of monitoring the street counts.     This is a big challenge  but ever so rewarding for the community. Any donation would be appreciated.         Wish me luck!    Thanks Tasha",False

A friend sent me a video of how one individual was making a big difference in the lives of children and adults in Zimbabwe by meeting this basic human need....food! I felt sad for the many individuals who were queueing to get some porridge and felt compelled to help. People are struggling in so many ways and with Covid-19  I can only imagine how people will survive! Only a person who has struggled or gone to bed hungry or watched their child starve would be the best person to tell the story...... Knowing that there are people rising up to help feed others who are really struggling at this difficult time is a step closer to lending a helping hand in such noble acts of kindness. However  we all know that one person cannot do it alone and that's where you come in to fit the missing piece of the puzzle...... There is power in unity and supporting each other to build a great nation!

My life has been privileged and compared to most  easy. So instead of getting drunk on cheap wine and eating cake  I will play video games for 12 hours & raise money for two foundations that are near to my heart.     First up - Stand Against Racism & Inequality. For those who are unaware  my half-brother is black. We were adopted when we were younger  and out of our many siblings  the majority of them are black. Living in a small Illinois town they were an oddity  and racism did exist. Not a day goes by where my family & I do not worry about each other  but we worry more about the ones who can be murdered for just being black in a white world.     50% of the donations that are raised over the course of the fundraiser will be donated to Stand up Against Racism & Inequality.     You can learn more about the charity by visiting their website: https://www.sariweb.org.uk/who-we-are/about-sari/      This is not a Black Lives Matter only organization  but helps with all racism  bigotry  and sexism. But their focus is helping victims of hate crimes  and with those on the rise in the UK we can all agree that its a good cause.       The second foundation is Paddington Partnership: https://www.thisispaddington.com/paddington-partnership/about-us    They work with businesses in the Paddington area to raise money  donate their time and help out at some of the less fortunate areas of Paddington. This is interesting because our Building we work in is about 50 Million  but if I cross the street and walk 3 minutes  there's a crap block of flats full of people struggling. Paddington Partnership takes the privileged workers in these fancy offices & pairs them with programs and events to help those in need.     My team at work read with the students of King Solomon Academy every week  and have for nearly 3 years now. I personally run a monthly bookclub at the Marlybone Woman's shelter where we're currently reading David Sedaris.    On top of that  every year 3-4 groups get together to help in the community in various ways. Food banks  Soup Kitchens  putting a party on for Halloween or even gardening & cleaning the school grounds.     50% of the proceeds will be sent to Paddington Partnership to be split 3 ways between the following:    King Solomon Academy:https://kingsolomonacademy.org/about-us/welcome-2  The Marlybone Project: https://www.maryleboneproject.org.uk/  The North Paddington Foodbank: https://www.npfoodbank.org.uk/      If you are able to donate  I would appreciate it.

As some of you will know I came to riba-roja d'Ebre on holiday with no intention at the time of staying. Unfortunately my motorhome died on me and having no fixed address in the uk I lived in my van on the banks of the river ebro for the next 2 years  no water  no electricity or cooking facilities  thinking how can I put this right.     Dispite several opportunities with other companies guiding here non came to anything and have been ""making do"" ever since.     Realising guiding here was my only way I could earn I tried to start myself from the bottom. I had a large loan from a friend for some tackle but no where near enough as winter demanded a boat and a 4x4 to move when needed.     November 2019 I had given up  kit had broke  inflatable boat stolen and sun damage to bivys there was no hope to continue.     December I returned to the uk  in hope to start a fresh life in Hereford and hopefully build a relationship with my kids and recently born grandson. First I needed a home and after discovering most my friends turned heroin or crack cocaine users my only option was council. After waiting several weeks with no money and sleeping rough I was told I had no local connections and they were unable to house me my home town where I grew up  my kids live I had no support at all.     Sleeping in a multi story car park for several more weeks I really did hit rock bottom  not only mentally but physically. Sharing my evenings begging on the streets and drinking with other homless I really started to wake up to life and realise it really is what you make of it. I fought my depression daily  tried to help others and spent most weekends talking to street pastures and discussing the possibilities of helping others. I knew more needed to be done but didnt know how. I spent the next month on the streets  engaging with all agencies  eating at the soup kitchens  contacting charity's and socialising with drug and alcohol abusers on a daily basis.     It became clear I needed to help myself before I could help others...  Also there was no future in Hereford for me  the dream of my kids visiting every sunday for dinner was never going to happen and needed to find my happy place.     During the time some local spainish people had kept in touch and I never realised how much they cared   It's like having a real family     The banks of the river ebro.  Catching or not  rain or unbearable heat the only place I really felt happy was there. With flights cheap and the offer of help and a lift to the airport i booked my return for march 16th. I spent the next 2 weeks saying my goodbyes to everyone  some I hadn't seen in years and some I know I may never see again.     Look down coming  no one thought I would make it but I caught the last flight out the UK  all 6 of us on the plane and i returned to riba-roja. Strange at first with nothing open  unable to go anywhere but I was used to being alone and on the bank so got my head down and into my fishing and had myself some lovely carp including a new PB common  I've named ""lockdown"" at 48lb.    Guiding is a young mans game  something i wont be able to do forever (but will continue until I achieve my goal) and when i first got stuck here i came up with an idea of a ""syndicate"" somewhere you dont have to be guided(optional)  somewhere you can take the whole family  somewhere you can return to year after year with each year things improving and getting better. Private  safe and secure. Storing for your own fishing tackle available. First class accommodation  electricity and running water.     Now Its time to make it happen.    I've been very lucky here and have 1 piece of land which I rent (struggling with payments atm) with the go ahead for everything I want aswell as electric on site.     I also have 2 other pieces of land owned by locals I'm able to make swims on when ready after years of talks and helping out locals and earning trust.    I have also found a 2 bed property on the banks of the ebro with access for 4 swims for sale.... a dream maybe but we will see where this goes before rulings it out.     Theres several options available for me but my preference would be to buy rather than build on rented land. The rented land would be available to buy also at the right price.     I thought it was impossible through gofund me to achieve this kind of money until someone pointed out the amount of fb friends I have  followers on my traveling angler page.     If 4950 friends donated £5 each the plans to build on the rented land will go ahead.     If 4950 friends donated £15 each I would purchase the land and house and commence building there.     I know many wont be able and some may give less but anything you can do would be appreciated and put to good use in building this dream.     Please feel free to share on your fb with your friends and fellow fishermen and Fisher ladies.     Syndicate prices will be £500 per year per person with 25 members which gives you 2 weeks fishing per year on the syndicate itself but other weeks available on the other swims.

The threat of Covid-19 is still here and will not disappear immediately. The UK currently has the second highest death rate from this virus in the world  so we need to make sure that we are still acting responsibly to protect ourselves and others. Not forgetting the fact that we are still uncertain as to whether a second peak will befall us  which has been the case in previous fatal viruses. As everyday life continues  we just will need to adapt to a new way of operating and interacting with those around us.    Bridging the gaps:    As lockdown eases  it is becoming more and more apparent that there are sectors that do not fall under the government’s priority list. These keyworkers are required to go back to work to support the economy and keep their families thriving. We would like to help them achieve this without any additional anxieties.    Approximate pricing for PPE is as follows:        Standard surgical mask £50 for 50    KN95 Mask £120 for 50    Disposable gloves (med grade) £45 for 100     Shoe covers £25 for 100 pairs    Disinfectant wipes (med grade) £25 for 1000    Antibacterial gel (alcohol based) £90 for 5 litres    Protective goggles £15.00    Face shield £10    Desk screen £50 - £150 (size depending)        What will we be doing?    With funds raised  we will be providing the ‘forgotten key workers’ with PPE so that they feel secure in their place of work. These include supermarket staff  transport workers  support workers  social care staff  delivery and logistic staff including food/sustenance providers who have had no choice but to continue working to support us and their families. They are often overlooked but have a major impact on how well our society continues to operate.    Who are we?    We are “can't STOP fashion”  a fashion with a purpose movement with a remit to address the issues at the forefront of society. This is accomplished through the collaboration of undiscovered and underrated talent from the fashion  media and entertainment industries. We hope to bring pressing social issues to audiences who often do not to indulge in mainstream media platforms  alongside showcasing these up and coming creatives with a purpose.        Quarantine Fashion Show:    Promotional Trailer Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDcel5r01jQ    To kickstart this PPE campaign  we have started with the “Quarantine Edition” fashion show which will be premiered globally on Sunday 31st May 2020.

We are providing food parcels for those individuals who are most in need  to help keep children fed and parents in good health through these hard times. Food and water will be sourced from local fishermen  farms  and markets on the island. This will ensure that your money stays in circulation on the island so it can carry on helping families across Galapagos.

I was in Galapagos throughout February and March as the Coronavirus pandemic hit. We were evacuated from the islands on one of the last planes to leave the islands on 16th March and behind us we left a community in turmoil. Whilst I was in Galapagos I made friends with some of the locals  and when I asked them if they were OK their response brought tears to my eyes. ""we are terrified  we feel so helpless""  they said ""There is no work. How do we feed our children?"". It was a shock to find out that the cost of food and water on the islands was double the price it would be on the mainland. In England we can just take water from the tap but in Galapagos the water is not drinkable so they have to buy bottled water. They have no choice  and as savings are used up each mouth full of water becomes very precious. I had to do something to help them and so with the help of my friend Patricio in Galapagos (I call him Pato) we came up with an idea to use crowdfunding on GoFundMe to help carry the islanders through these hard times. As Coronavirus has swept the globe Ecuador's port city of Guayaquil (the gateway to the Galapagos Islands) has been one of the hardest hit places in South America. All tourism has ceased to these magical islands where Charles Darwin came up with his theory of evolution. No tourists are able to visit the islands and with no end to these restrictions in sight  The Galapagos Islands are now suffering catastrophic economic damage as lockdown has halted all tourism. For 90% of resident’s tourism was their only source of income and now they have been left with nothing. (see pictures) Before Coronavirus After Coronavirus Your money will provide vital food to the residents of Galapagos so families can stay healthy until their economy recovers enough for them to rebuild their livelihood once more. Locals are struggling to make ends meet; with no income they have no money to buy food and families are going hungry. ¿Qué haremos con el dinero? Estamos proporcionando paquetes de alimentos para aquellas personas que más lo necesitan  para ayudar a mantener a los niños alimentados y a los padres con buena salud en estos tiempos difíciles.

He fears that Pip may have one or more components of the triad comprising Chiari Malformation  craniocervical instability and/or tethered cord associated with her chronic health condition. You see my wife has a condition called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome causing faulty collagen that we only believed to be life limiting. Until now Pip has had a full and exciting life  serving in the Royal Navy  studying to be a nurse as well as an extraordinary amount of voltunteer work. She became a qualified leader in scouting and guiding  ran a soup kitchen for 2 years  has sponsored many family’s through Christmas’s and back into employment.

NOW So I’m asking our network of friends to please help us. Unfortunately the scan required for diagnosis is an ‘Upright MRI Scan’ of the cervical lumber spine which will establish if she has any of these conditions. This comes at a steep cost and adding on travel to the Medserena Scanner and to see the UK specialist after the scan we need to raise £2000. The NHS does not own an Upright MRI Scanner and therefore is unable to offer the test required  hence having to pay privately for the scan she has been referred for. Pip wants to enjoy being a mum  but as you can imagine; with this hanging over her head it’s a very emotional time. If you can make a donation or help with a fundraiser  we would appreciate it so much. You can make donations via PayPal. After everything that has been thrown at her over the last 6 years she has fought through to defy all odds. She’s living every second to the max  even starting her little business from home 3 years ago (Pip’s Embroidery UK) when many people would have just given up on employment. She deserves to know  so that she has the chance to try and seek a treatment. Please help my wife  my sons mum. John & Harrison",False

The building is situated immediately west of this historic town centre  within the historic town of Bedford; well known for being the home to the likes of preacher and writer of the acclaimed book ‘Pilgrims Progress’  John Bunyan  Edward the Elder’s first known castle fortress and Barony of Bedford.     The building is located on the A6 (Clapham Rd) which is easy to get to regardless of which route into Bedford you are taking. The building is placed between St Martins Church and Livingstone School as well as being a short and enjoyable walks to the beautiful Bedford Park.    Use of the Building    The intention for the building is primarily to be used as a place of worship for ‘all nations’ within the community of Bedford. F.C.C will also play host to a number of community initiatives such as a children’s and Youth activity centre  Meet & Chat Coffee Mornings  Soup Kitchen  OAP’s luncheon activity day  educational activities as well as a Performing Arts initiative. Once complete  the F.C.C building will stand as a beacon in Clapham road Bedford  bringing a fresh look to this area of Bedford.    How far have we come?    St Martins Church  after being unable to keep up with the maintenance of this building  eventually sold it to the council  which planned to turn it into a pre-school in coalition with Livingstone Primary School  which is its neighbouring building to its right. After promised money from government to improve schools were withdrawn  the council had no choice but to put the church hall back on the property market.    Being on the market for two years  we made some inquiries and after much debate about the condition of the property and its value  we managed to decrease the asking price from £250 000 to £70 000. We had managed to raise £82 000 and we were able to buy the property in 2013 cash for £70 000. At the end of 2015 we finally received planning permission for the refurbishment  partial rebuilding and extension of the old St Martin’s Church Hall  to create a significantly new  multipurpose community centre.      The official plans can be seen at the Borough Councils Planning Portal here:     http://edrms.bedford.gov.uk/PlanningBrowse.aspx?id=seZayNzlK66rbT8o9SOTWQ%3d%3d    Since obtaining Planning Permission  we have focussed on...    1. Raising as much funds as possible (£53 000 to date)    2. Putting a design team together  this consists of an Architect  Quantity Surveyor  Structural Engineer  Electrical & Mechanical Engineer and a Principle Designer (CDM) (as well as having integral input from all energy and power supply companies. This team alone will cost £16k circa.     3. Obtaining 4 builders quotes all ranging from between £500k to £1.5million    4. Writing to Funding Organisations  Churches and Individual Donors.     The design team are working hard to have the “Working Constructions Drawing” (Building Regs Plan) completed by Christmas 2016 to tender in order to Start work within the first quarter of 2017.    Among the core services we offer our community  we also aim to provide a range of high quality and cost effective services to the local community  with the potential to develop new services in response to the changing needs of the community. The many types of skill sets available through FCC affiliation as well as the many needs those skills sets aims to reach on a weekly basis  leaves us with no choice but to build upon what we already have  bringing what we do using four different location  under one roof.    Another part of our project that we are excited about involves working in partnership with Bedford Borough  local doctor surgeries and community services to pilot a volunteering ‘Community Health Champion’ service. Active ‘Health Champion’ models in action combined with the spiritual and emotional support churches offer across the UK have proven to be very successful; our aim is once the project has matured and gained the local communities trust  we will run a 24 hours support service for the emotional and mental needs of beneficiaries at the time their crisis occurs. Crisis can happen at any time  in the same way an individual with a broken leg or a heart attack shouldn't have to wait to see a doctor during office hours  those with emotional and mental crisis should have the same opportunities.     Mental and emotional health should have the same amount of care  thought and urgency  as physical health. As our building sits in one of the lowest deprived areas in the country  we aim to notably promote this unique service in this particular LSOAs (Lower Layer Super Output Area) which is among the 0-20% most deprived areas in Bedford and Kempston town.     Time banking’ (TB)  a way for people from all walks of life to ‘deposit’ their time in the TB by giving practical help and support to others  being able to ‘withdraw’ their time when they need something done themselves. TB promotes social inclusion and empowers individuals by making members feel valued  enabling them to share their skills with others learning new skills themselves.    Partnerships and effective community involvement is vital to ensure our project services and activities are a success. Involving local residents  particularly disadvantaged and vulnerable communities  in helping to design and deliver our projects and services will help build confidence  ownership and a sense of community. We are in the process of consulting with local council and professional organisations  such as TB UK regarding planning  implementation and sustaining our community service as well as contacting other similar projects to share and learn from their experience.

Through the loss  the change  the upside down-ness  I’ve moved into a new season with God.    At the beginning of the pandemic in March the Lord clearly spoke to me and asked me to do an online Life Coaching course for a year. Having plenty of time on my hands and being stuck in the house I took this as a great opportunity and said YES.    My Journey So Far    I am a visionary that has been used mightily by God. In 2002 I set up and ran ‘Hospitality and Hope’  a charity for homeless and vulnerable people in South Tyneside. I did this on a voluntary basis for a total of 15 years. I spent these 15 years following God’s guidance step by step. I set up a soup kitchen  which then became a charity  which went on to become a foodbank  clothing bank  supported living accommodation et al. This all culminated in me receiving a British Empire medal from the Queen and the charity winning the Queen’s Award for voluntary service. You can see the video of my journey of faith below.    Unfortunately  as a result of working 80+ hours a week   I then became ill. I took time out to recuperate and find myself; I had lost myself in the work. I visited two Christian retreats and it was at these centres that I encountered the powerful way that creativity could be used in the healing process. God can speak through anything; pictures  poetry  woodwork  needlework  gardening and more.    My Creative Journey Begins    It became apparent that my time in the charity was over. God had me on the next part of my journey. I started a creative group called Come to the Table. This group met once a fortnight. We gathered around a large table to eat  talk  pray and create. It helped many people in different ways. Connection and creativity worked hand in hand to help and heal. However  when the lockdown happened it was no longer possible to meet like this.    Creativity and Coaching    The Lord spoke to me one Sunday when I was in church (prior to Covid) and told me to offer someone one to one creative sessions. I had never done these one to one creative sessions with anyone before and the Lord had to ask me three times before I said YES. Before the first session I was very nervous and had no idea what to do. But God gave me a download of exactly what I should do and I was amazed at how the creative sessions impacted my client’s life. Every session since  God has given me the exact creative activity to do and I have seen healing and freedom come from these sessions.    My online coaching course required me to find two people to practice with. Straight away it came to me to ask the person I had been doing creative one to one sessions with. She said YES. And so Creative Coaching was born in my life.    Both my clients have been helped enormously through this process. Both of them had previously been to see counsellors and clinical professionals. But creative coaching offered something new and different that helped them to become free.    In this I have seen God work through me to reach others with long term mental health issues. I stand amazed. By word of mouth I have other people interested in doing creative coaching. I know the Lord is using me in a mighty way.     What Next?    What I need now in order to proceed and help many more people is a studio to deliver Creative Coaching. A self contained  secure  comfortable and readymade creative environment where folk can come and feel safe and get individual attention.     The studio comes in parts and is moveable so it is future proof!    I believe the Lord asked me to set up a Go Fund Me page and gave me the specific target figure of £17 000 to cover; the cost of a studio with electrics and the remedial work like clearing the ground and laying a flat base. This is really stepping outside of my comfort zone. I have again given God my YES and wait to see what happens.    I now need help in pursuing the next stage of my journey  again helping people but this time using coaching and creativity. After spending 15 years volunteering for the charity (1 year paid)  I feel God is wanting me to make this my ministry. Yes  I will be making a charge for this service  but up until now I have given freely of my time. I will continue to do free sessions for those who can’t afford to pay.    I have seen the results that creative coaching has had and relish the opportunity to help many more people. I want to pursue what really matters; the opportunity to help rebuild people’s lives. Some have been stuck for many  many years. To see the effects that creative coaching is having is absolutely astounding. Only God could do this.    Why would you sow into this?    You would not only be sowing into my life by providing a space to work from but also be sowing into the lives of others who need help to walk into freedom. This is a unique opportunity for you to make a difference in someone else’s life. Will you give it your YES?    I will be making regular updates and hope to make a video of the studio site before  during and after.    Please watch the short films of two people's accounts of how creative coaching has impacted their lives.    Thank you.    Amelia      Creative Coaching Client recommendations:    1:1 Creative Coaching Sessions  I have now completed 5 coaching sessions with Amelia. Each session has been specifically designed to address the coaching focus in question  and in my case involves a creative activity.  I have been astounded by Amelia’s ability to produce relevant activities which help me to focus on  and talk through  the issues in question. The process of creating makes it easy to share with Amelia the sometimes emotional aspects of the issues I am addressing. It particularly helps me to identify how I am feeling and what I believe and think about an aspect of my life. This then enables me to address and change any wrong thinking. Throughout this process Amelia brings wisdom and presents challenge in a safe  calm environment. I would highly recommend Amelia as a coach.  Beth     Life Coaching  When I first started this life coaching course with Amelia I had very little expectation of it being able to help me. I have been a Christian for a long while and have sought help many times with little or no results ( except disappointment) . However I can honestly say that in the weeks that Amelia has been coaching me  my life has turned around. I am beginning to think differently and I am acting differently. Amelia doesn’t say very much but she does listen and gives me pointers to direct my thoughts and feelings in alignment with the word of God. The visual things she gets me to do  although simple  they have a great impact on me. I am so thankful to God for allowing me to do this course with such a spirit filled loving person who genuinely cares for the people she coaches.   Many  many  thanks to Amelia for all of the time and prayers that she puts into helping me and so many others.  Rosie    I want to make a difference  A Poem Written by Amelia E Luffrum    I want to make a difference  To everyone I meet  I want to make a difference  To people in the street.    I want to make a difference  To everyone I know  I want to make a difference  Everywhere I go.    I want to make a difference  To friends and loved ones too  I want to make a difference  Especially to you.    I want to make a difference  To show I really care  I want to make a difference  A moment just to share    I want to make a difference  In the things I do and say  I want to make a difference  In a positive way.    So if I’ve made a difference  In even the smallest way  Then you too can make a difference  In someone else’s day.      To find out more about my journey  take a look at the video below:    ",False

I am working towards becoming one of the first girls to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout. My Eagle project is a food drive for the Soup Kitchen London.  ​  About the Soup Kitchen:   The Soup Kitchen London  located on Tottenham Court Road  is a resource for the homeless  elderly  lonely and vulnerable in London. They provide free meals  clothing  toiletries and a sense of belonging to over 150 friends each day. Additionally  they provide an on-site therapist to address our guests' mental health needs. With the help of hundreds of volunteers each year  their aim is to provide a nutritious meal in a safe and warm environment that welcomes anyone who needs it.    Soup Kitchen serves two meals a day. The first meal consists of a takeaway bag (a social distancing effort) containing a sandwich  soup  yoghurt  porridge  a piece of fruit and a snack bar. The second meal consists of a nutritional and balanced hot lunch.   ​  Why I am fundraising:   Due to coronavirus  the Soup Kitchen London is one of the last organisations feeding the homeless in Central London. Four other organisations have had to stop their operations. The Soup Kitchen has lost a large amount of funding  donations and volunteers. Despite this  their number of guests have skyrocketed and more than 1/4 of their guests are new faces.    With the funds raised  I will purchase food supplies for the Soup Kitchen. Supplies like tinned vegetables  tinned beans  tinned tomatoes  pasta  butter porridge oats  dried herbs  stock powder  sugar  vegetable oil  salt/pepper  jam  peanut butter  tinned fruit  dried fruit and instant coffee/tea. The purchased food will be thoroughly sanitized and dropped off at the Soup Kitchen in a socially distanced way.    What you can do:   If you are able to donate £5 that would be amazing! Any and all donations are greatly appreciated!",False

The kitchen has become a safe refuge for those in need as well as a place for the community and friends to gather.      However  as the kitchen has grown alongside awareness of its presence so have the demands that come with running it. Currently the kitchen is staffed entirely by volunteers (including the founder Solomon Smith  who is also a volunteer) who can not dedicate the growing time required to keep everything running smoothly and it is challenging with our tiny resources to meet the needs of our vulnerable service users.      That is why we are launching our new campaign to raise enough money to provide food for the winter season  our busiest season and to support with our operations costs as well as make essential repairs to the kitchen. It is so important to have a constant presence in the kitchen and we feel a manager will help us achieve that. Approximately £12 000 of this funding campaign will also be spent on much needed repairs with a portion being saved for contingency costs. We believe that if we were to raise enough money to pay for a manager for one year they will assist in us providing the kitchen with a steadier source of income that will then pay for their presence in the years following.      Not only will it help the all the hard working staff at the kitchen but will also massively benefit the service users  providing them with a person they know they can talk to if they have any problems or suggestions.
