We are an entirely voluntary organisation with more than 100 volunteers who are out, in teams, every night of the year. We help people at evey level of homelessness, including the street homeless through those in hostels, bed and breakfast and unsatisfactory accommodation. We also help former homeless poeple who are still vulnerable and whose main point of contact is via the homeless community. An important part of our work is not only the physical but the emoitional and spiritual wellbeing of the people we see. We are involved in supplying food, clothing, household goods and in the resettlement of former homeless people into new accommodation. We have no paid staff and the charity does not own property (a church allows us a kitchen and storage areas at a low rent). Our adminsitrative costs are therefore very low so a high proportion of money donated to us goes directly to people in need. We have continued to operate every night during the Covid Crisis where we have seen as many as 90 people on a Sunday and 60 during the week as other services have withdrawn.","2020-12-11 20/2020-12-10 100/2020-12-08 30/2020-12-08 100/2020-12-07 20/2020-12-07 5/2020-12-06 5/2020-12-05 10/2020-12-05 80/2020-12-04 50/2020-12-02 5/2020-12-01 5/2020-11-30 10/2020-11-29 40/2020-11-29 5/2020-11-29 50/2020-11-29 30/2020-11-28 10/2020-11-28 15/2020-11-28 5/2020-11-28 5/2020-11-27 10/2020-11-27 5/2020-11-27 2/2020-11-27 30/2020-11-27 5/2020-11-27 5/2020-11-25 15/2020-11-25 30/2020-11-25 15/2020-11-25 5/2020-11-25 15/2020-11-25 1/2020-11-25 10/2020-11-25 10/2020-11-24 20/2020-11-24 10/2020-11-23 20/2020-11-22 10/2020-11-21 5/2020-11-21 15/2020-11-21 20/2020-11-20 20/2020-11-19 20/2020-11-19 5/2020-11-19 10/2020-11-19 10/2020-11-19 15/2020-11-18 20/2020-11-18 20/2020-11-18 15/2020-11-18 20/2020-11-18 20/2020-11-18 10/2020-11-18 20/2020-11-18 30/2020-11-18 50/2020-11-18 30/2020-11-18 15/2020-11-18 30",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=BillHughes2&pageUrl=1,2020-12-11,Essex,"CO8 5EU ",1251

The site is 11.5 acres in total with a Specialist Care Unit for dogs that provides intense care for the dogs that need it the most, pregnant bitches, nursing mums and dogs that do not adjust well to the traditional kennel environment at Manchester Dogs' Home.   The work we do We take in and care for over 5,000 dogs every year, many of these dogs are never reclaimed by their owners and require a great degree of emotional and physical support during their stay with us.   In addition to the Specialist Care Unit at our Cheshire Home, we also utilise a wide range of behavioural and mentally stimulating activities at both Homes to ensure each dog receives personal care and attention.   Once the dogs are fit and healthy they are made available for adoption, we are always looking for caring permanent and foster homes for our dogs and often have over 250 dogs that are waiting to find that perfect family.","2020-12-09 1",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=DeepthiReddy&pageUrl=1,2020-12-11,,,2

Over 500 people have been placed into temporary accommodation as a result of pandemic, and partners in the city have identified 150 at risk of homelessness if they are not provided with support to find a permanent home. The charity is making an important first step towards this goal as they open a new house in December that will provide accommodation to 13 people with experience of rough sleeping. However they need help to make sure it feels like a home. The charity believes that making a house feel like a home and connecting with local community can be the difference to someone maintaining their accommodation and breaking the cycle of homelessness. To aid with this, the charity are appealing to the public to give this festive season. Funds raised will provide people with mobile phones and tablets to keep them connected, help each house feels like a home and ensure everyone has food on the table and a gift to open this Christmas. Mark Grant, Chief Executive of Action Homeless, said; ‘Sadly more people than ever before are in need of safe and secure housing. There has been an incredible effort in Leicester this year to respond to the crisis and support people experiencing homelessness. However, now Action Homeless want to look ahead so, rather than simply responding to crisis, we are working towards our key aim of breaking the cycle of homelessness in Leicester. As we reach the end of a difficult year, we are delighted to be able to open a new house that will provide a home to 13 more people. The funds we raise this festive season will enable us to help people as they move into new homes and ensure we can provide the support they need to reach their goals and leave homelessness behind for good.” Every night of the year, the charity is home to 204 people who would otherwise have nowhere else to go. Where possible it aims to give people and families long term affordable homes and the support they need so they can start to rebuild their lives. The charity believes it is only when people feel stable and secure in their homes, and when they are able to stop worrying about where they are sleeping from one week to the next, that they can really turn their lives around. 100% of money donated by the public, will go towards supporting local people affected by homelessness.    ","2020-12-10 60/2020-12-09 15/2020-11-30 5/2020-11-30 15/2020-11-30 2",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=GTLeicester&pageUrl=2,2020-12-10,Kent,"ME14 4PG",97

Every year we work side by side with thousands of homeless people, to help them rebuild their lives and leave homelessness behind for good. Through our pioneering research into the causes and consequences of homelessness and the solutions to it, we know what it will take to end it. Together with others who share our resolve, we bring our knowledge, experience and determination to campaign for the changes that will solve the homelessness crisis once and for all. We bring together a unique volunteer effort each Christmas, to bring warmth, companionship and vital services to people at one of the hardest times of the year, and offer a starting point out of homelessness.  We know that homelessness is not inevitable. We know that together we can end it.

Over the years the City of Manchester has grown around Manchester Dogs' Home and it is now very much an inner city rescue centre.  To off set the inner city environment of our Manchester Home we regenerated a run down site that is now know as Cheshire Dogs' Home In 1999 we purchased a former run down boarding kennels, this has become the flagship of the two homes and a Centre of Excellence. The site is 11.5 acres in total with a Specialist Care Unit for dogs that provides intense care for the dogs that need it the most, pregnant bitches, nursing mums and dogs that do not adjust well to the traditional kennel environment at Manchester Dogs' Home.   The work we do We take in and care for over 5,000 dogs every year, many of these dogs are never reclaimed by their owners and require a great degree of emotional and physical support during their stay with us.   In addition to the Specialist Care Unit at our Cheshire Home, we also utilise a wide range of behavioural and mentally stimulating activities at both Homes to ensure each dog receives personal care and attention.   Once the dogs are fit and healthy they are made available for adoption, we are always looking for caring permanent and foster homes for our dogs and often have over 250 dogs that are waiting to find that perfect family.",,https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=NanJia&pageUrl=1,,,,0

Over half of all cancer research in the UK is carried out by our scientists. We have discovered new ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer that together have saved millions of lives across the world.  We have been at the heart of the progress that has already seen survival rates double in the last thirty years.
