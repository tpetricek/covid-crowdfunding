This year has been difficult for everyone  and it has put so much pressure on Charities that provide essential support to families suffering every day. This Christmas  we wanted to give back to those who are struggling over the festive period with a lack of food and shelter.    Will you join us in making a difference? We are raising money in aid of The Trussell Trust and every donation will help. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much!    More information about The Trussell Trust: The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need  providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.",False

industry  from editors  booksellers and authors  to publicists  agents and designers  are donating money to go towards helping the acute crisis in poverty and hunger amongst the least well off in the country.    We live in a nation where more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. The Trussell Trust has given out over 1.6 million packs of food supplies in the past year alone. Food Banks are not just a place to pick up essential sustenance  with cuts to community centres and frontline services they have also become mini-welfare and advice centres.    We're aiming to raise £5000 before Christmas 2019  which will go to the Trussell Trust. Your donation will directly help those most in need of support. It is vital that those working in publishing come together as a community and take action.    It is important to help those in greatest need but solutions must also be found to the reasons people find themselves in need of food banks.    The Trussell Trust’s CEO Emma Revie has indicated that the benefits system has been driving a rise in foodbank use– the charity released their State of Hunger 2019 report in November.    “This is the busiest six months we’ve ever seen – more people than ever before are being forced to foodbanks’ doors ” said Revie. “Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty  but currently thousands of women  men and children are not receiving sufficient protection from destitution. This is not right. But we know this situation can be fixed – our benefits system could be the key to unlocking people from poverty. We need to put money back into the pockets of people who most need our support. It’s in our power as a country to end the need for foodbanks. This can change.”        Thank you for your support.

Our party no longer trusts in the ‘generosity’ of Westminster to bridge the centuries old North-South divide. This tried and tested approach is destined to fail. The centrality of London  with its capacity to gobble-up all of this country’s assets  is built into the very fabric of the ‘United Kingdom.’ Infrastructure  people  resources  opportunities: all filter south by design. We believe  then  that only through a referendum – with a resounding ‘yes’ – will we solve  once and for all  that vast array of economic and social disparities that split this island in two. We have over 200 active volunteers using a free Slack workspace. But we have hundreds more signed up and waiting to join. Our next obstacle to overcome is to invest in a membership system and organisational tools so we can become sustainable and begin organising activities leading up to us challenging council seats in the local elections of 2021.     We are a transparent party run by ordinary Northerners. We have no secret donors or other means of generating an income. Our spend to date on the movement was £1.19 to register a domain name. But we have reached the point where we cannot go any further without incurring some additional expenses.

We will be making free packed lunches throughout the half term for children. If anyone is struggling to make ends meet  please drop us a message (will be strictly confidential) and we will provide a pack up for your children starting from the 27th of October through the half term. We will ensure we are in full PPE whilst making pack ups for hygiene reasons and to avoid risk of contamination  and can arrange delivery/collection.     We understand times are hard at the moment and we want to do our bit to support families and children  please do not hesitate to message us. This is entirely self funded so if anyone would like to donate that would be amazing.

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.    All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.    If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free. Thankyou for your support.    The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need  providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.    All the best    Jack Monroe.

The project is being run out of St Edmund’s church hall on Lanehouse Rocks Road in Weymouth. Donations of non-perishable food items and household items are welcome between 10:30am and 12:30pm on Thursdays.

This year  everything is a bit different.     We would like to give people needing the foodbank a gift voucher to use just as they wish. To buy something they really need. And especially for parents - to be able to buy the gifts that their kids are wishing for.     Do you want to help? Rather than donating a wrapped gift this year  please contribute to our campaign. We will use all money raised to buy gift vouchers from Argos and B&M  and distribute these to people using the foodbank in time for Christmas. We would love your support!

But the coronavirus epidemic will be a massive challenge for them  on a whole new scale. More and more people are going to need their help over the next few months.    People on zero hours contracts won't get paid.    Food will need to be delivered to the elderly and sick who are self-isolating.    If schools close  many children will lose their main meal and need to be fed.    And all this is happening at a time when the rest of us are going to the supermarket less and - let's be honest - thinking about our own food cupboards first.    So  here's a very simple way to help. You give money. Every time we get to £100 I ask the foodbank what they need most and go and get it. If things get really bad  I will organise a delivery. We all keep doing this over and over again until things get better.      Why aren't Fair Frome doing this? Well  they've got a heck of a lot on their plate right now and this is one way I can take the load off them. It's also easier for me to set up a fundraiser as an individual.    Who am I anyway? Good question  I have volunteered for the food bank before  and here I am with Lenka  their co-ordinator  in the food bank. Fair Frome know that I am making this appeal and are very happy to have the fundraising happen.      I will post the receipt on here every time I go shopping.

As it is has been cancelled  The Blue Blades have challenged HUBC to a race on the weekend of June 13th and June 14th.

The Blue Blades are an alumni group from Hull University Boat Club.

The children have been learning about their rights which are listed in a document called the UN Convention on The Rights of the Child  or UNCRC. They have recently been learning about Article 27  which states that every child has the right to an adequate standard of living that is good enough to meet their physical needs  their social needs and support their development. Whilst doing research in class  the children found that 2020 has seen a 62% increase in children in Scotland needing to be fed from food banks when compared with 2019.     The pupils have planned to do a Rights Run in school in December and in partnership with Coatbridge Community Foodbank have arranged for a food collection to take place. Inspired by the children's passion to make a positive difference I have also decided to raise funds on my own as well as donating to the schools great cause.    A Markothon is running at leat 5km a day everyday in December.    Since 1st of December I have done 128 km of running and on course to smash the 155km target.

10/2020-03-20 50/2020-03-20 10","The world is experiencing an unprecedented challenge. It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Robin Hood Fund has launched to support our city and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.    The Robin Hood Fund     Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.    In Nottingham we have a famous history of looking after one another. You could call it the spirit of Robin Hood - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.     So we are creating something called the Robin Hood Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.     Our city has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Robin Hood Fund has been set up for us to shine a light on these vital projects and help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.     Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that if possible you donate and contribute to the common good of Nottingham. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.    The spirit of Robin Hood has created something unique in our city  now is the time to reignite that spirit so please donate today if you can and if you can’t please help us spread the word.      * * *    FAQs    What can I do?    Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the vulnerable.     Where have funds been used?    Since the Robin Hood Fund started we have always had one goal  to raise as much money as possible to help those most in need.     To date; the following causes have been supported;     Since the Robin Hood Fund launched we have had one clear goal  to raise much needed funds to support the most vulnerable people in Nottingham during the Covid-19 crisis. Following an amazing response from the people and organisations of our city we have already exceeded all expectations in raising more than £75 000 which has been distributed - or is in the process of being distributed - to a number of charities and organisations undertaking such important work during these difficult times.      To date; the following causes have been supported:      Foodbanks (£20 000)    The Robin Hood Fund has distributed £20 000 in support of food banks across Nottingham. Working closely with Hope Nottingham and Nottingham Forest in the Community to deliver the wider support  food and supplies have been centrally purchased and then distributed to a number of different food banks  including: NG11 Clifton Foodbank  Meadows Foodbank  Grace Church  HOPE Nottingham  Bestwood & Bulwell Foodbank  Himmah / Muslim Hands  Arnold Foodbank and St. Ann’s Advice Centre.      Homeless Organisations (£10 000)    Emmanuel House was awarded £6 000 for additional specialist key worker support to boost its team at a time when Nottingham’s homeless community is at grave risk. This support is helping to ensure the homeless community are being placed into hotel accommodation as an emergency measure as hostels are very vulnerable to outbreaks.       There has also been £4 000 of support released to Framework to enable them to purchase essential items to the Homeless community in Nottingham. This included  but was not limited to  the provision of items such as mobile phones so that they can remain in contact with key workers and minimise the chance of these individuals being unable to stick to the government guidelines on social distancing.       Refugee Groups (£2 500)    Refugee Roots were provided with support to allow them to move from a model that required face to face contact  to being able to still provide support in a safe and socially distanced way.      In addition  Refugee Forum has been provided with funding for a destitution fund to ensure those with no access to support in other places can still get support.       Vulnerable Women (£4 500)    Nottingham Women's Centre have been awarded funding to help them to provide mental health support and online counselling  including training for counsellors to be able to provide online support.      In addition to this  further support was provided to POW Nottingham  an organisation supporting the rights of sex workers and those at risk of being exploited. This funding enabled them to purchase essential items including food and toiletries.      Disability Groups (£2 500)      With social distancing measures causing increased issues for the disability community in Nottingham  this support has enabled the Disability Support Nottingham organisation to increase its capability to provide phone support - in addition to welfare checks - to those in need.      Vulnerable Young People (£2 500)     Funding has also been provided to help support the amazing work of Nottingham YMCA  who are working with the most vulnerable young people in our city during this crisis. The support has helped to provide food and toiletries to those housed in supported YMCA and transitional accommodation.      Where will the funds go?    The most vulnerable people during this crisis and will be administered by the city council and delivered by people and organisations across the city that can help the most vulnerable.    Every Monday Nottingham City Council will administer the release of funds from GoFundMe to Nottingham City Council bank account. This means Nottingham City Council should  on average  have the money in the bank no later than Friday of every week.    Once in Nottingham City Council account the funds are ring fenced and held until the decision re: allocation has been made.    A working group  chaired by Lee Walker  will be set up to recommend how that branch of funds is released. This group is tasked with making the biggest impact possible whilst also being certain that the organisations in receipt a) need and b) promise to spend quickly ie. nobody saves the money. On Tuesday of each week the working group will have a paper approved by a member of ‘gold’ and paperwork will be sent to a small governance committee who are tasked with ethics and assuring the highest standards of governance and distribution.    Remotely the governance group will scrutinise and approve. Once approved Nottingham City Council agrees to distribute as agreed.    Money will then go out asap so groups and organisations are in receipt within 5 days. A one page press note to support and communication online to be transparent.      If I do donate will it go to those who need it?     Yes  100% of any donation will go to those who need it.    I want to help my local community; will this money be spent in Nottingham?     Yes.

We have teamed up with some local carers from the community to bring you  'Dance for Carers'. This Thursday a group of carers will show you their moves as we dance together to raise money for Local FoodBanks who are struggling in these times.

Over 90% of the food distributed by foodbanks in The Trussell Trust network is donated by the public.    Ivybridge Foodbank is seeing unprecedented numbers of the community in crisis  this has been reflected in what has proven to be an extremely busy period with more individuals falling into crisis as the impact of Covid-19 unfolds.

Funds raised are to be shared equally between two much needed food projects in our communities  these being Lumley Methodist Church who are cooking and delivering over 115 hot meals twice a week and Bournmoor  Fence Houses & Woodstone Foodbank who are delivering many many food parcels throughout our villages. Both projects are much needed in these challenging times for vulnerable people and families in need  over 30 volunteers are involved in total across both projects.  Both Tommy & Kevin live locally and are passionate about their communities  their 10k run will take place on Saturday 9th May  to make things a little more challenging Tommy will be wearing a weighted top and Kevin will be in uniform complete with stab proof vest.  Any support at all that can be given will be very much appreciated by all in this amazing fundraiser  every little helps. Kind regards  Alan",False

10/2019-12-02 5/2019-12-02 5","Christmas is one of the toughest times of the year for lots of people. Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland.

The Food Bank provides a vital service to the local population and the wider Bradford area. The restrictions we are all experiencing make it harder for people to donate actual food  but we want to give people the opportunity to give cash instead.    Although the fund-raising page says donations will go straight to Michael Faulkner  who is secretary of Churches Together in Ilkley  in fact of course money will go directly to the Foodbank .",False

The fall off in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that we have had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased our costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries. All donations will go directly to purchasing items for food parcels.

With covid showing no signs of being a thing of the past  more families will be left without a job and nowhere to turn.    The thought of our boys going without is scary and whilst we are lucky enough to not have been affected I know there will be people in and around Newbury who can't eat a proper meal.    No one should have to go a day without a cooked meal.    Now more than ever we all need to pull together.    With this mind on the 14th November I will walk from the Thatcham food bank to the Hungerford food bank.

Our lives have changed radically with COVID-19 and we have also realised that even if we are still young  we can try to help those in need. It all started with a math challenge we had to solve. If we managed to solve it in a day  we would receive 100 pounds from friends of our parents! Enough to buy our dream dog! We sat down a whole morning and solved it. However  we both decided that other people need this money more than us in these difficult times. Especially food banks all over our country. So this is how it all began  we have now decided to take on as many challenges as possible and donate the money raised to The Trussel Trust. We hope that you will help us by suggesting challenges and donating money along the way. We are ready to tackle anything  sports  artistic  academic  culinary  linguistic  we will give it our best! Thank you in advance for your generosity!    More information about The Trussell Trust: The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need  providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.",False

In light of COVID-19  we are finding many families are:   • In isolation  unable to access basic necessities  • Are vulnerable  with pre-existing conditions  • Left unemployed and unable to put food on the table    EMB is dedicating itself to ensuring no one in our community is left behind.     We have started collecting food donations and delivering food parcels to the most vulnerable through our network of amazing volunteers. We have been taken back by the number of people requiring help.     We've partnered up with Tesco  Marks & Spencers & The Corner Cake Shop who are providing any excess stock they can give away. We have a wonderful community that has been generously purchasing a little extra with their weekly shop and kindly donating it to the cause  but unfortunately  we are still lacking some vital resources.    We want to raise £1 000 to be able to purchase food directly ourselves and provider our team of volunteers with the correct PPC gear while they are out making donations.     No one is sure how long this lockdown will last  and it will get worse before it's better. We will be running this service to at least the next three months. If the crisis lasts longer  we will continue until we see fit.     EMB is a not-for-profit organisation - every penny goes directly back into providing resources. If you can't financially donate  please considering dropping off any fresh or long-life food to our HQ on Molesworth Road.     If you'd like to volunteer and help out within the community  please join our Facebook group - Mid Ulster Corona Virus Community Support Network    Now more than ever  we must look out for each other and protect those in the community that require help.

On 8/11/20 (Hill Day) I'll be attempting to run up one of the Isle of Wight' s steepest hills as many times as I can in 1 hour to raise money for the Ventnor Community Foodbank.     The initial response from friends has been: 'Why the hell do you want to do that??!' And that's a very good question...    So here's my answer:  I started running here on the Island to keep me sane. After difficult times it gave me a positive frame of mind I could not live without nowadays. During Lockdown it became a way for me to be worthwhile and happy when tens of thousands of people in the UK have struggled to do so in 2020.     The perverse thing is  I started to love running up hills. The steeper the better  I began to relish the challenge! Fortunately  Ventnor is full of the bloody things  and being a masochistic b******d I picked the steepest one with a road on it I could. The Hill With No Name runs 1/2 mile in length up a height of 317 feet (peak is 672 feet above sea level). Seriously  a cable car would be a viable way of getting up it. It's a bit of a monster.    So the plan is to run/walk/crawl as many times up it as possible in 1 hour. My chosen charity is the Ventnor Community Foodbank who do an invaluable job of supporting children and families here. During these trying times they deserve all the help they can get in supporting local people. Please check out their facebook page for info about donation points and what they need.    https://www.facebook.com/Ventnor-Community-Foodbank-112414990512592/    Here's a time-lapse of the hill.

We at CIG are very lucky people  we work for a company that cares for us and pays us and allows us to work from home.     With the care packages sent out i was thinking that there must be a lot of needy people needing support with food and care during this trying time and rather than sit there and wait for someone to help i decided to start this charity drive to earn a little of money to give to the stockport foodbank charity  they currently have 7 locations in stockport and help all people who are in need of extra  not just during this trying time but always.

We demand the University of Birmingham:  * Gives an above RPI inflation pay increase to all support staff;  * Becomes a Living Wage Accredited employer;  * Eliminates the gender pay gap by 2020;  * Fixes the Support Staff pay spine & allocates a budget for it;  * Negotiates with all unions on the joint unions' report on working conditions at the university (available on our website).    Hundreds of caterers  cleaners  security guards and other support staff who are members of UNISON at the University of Birmingham are in dispute with the University of Birmingham and have taken strike action on the University's Open Day on Friday 28th June as they feel let down by the University’s senior management. Unless the University of Birmingham's senior managers are prepared to address our demands  we will have no other choice but to continue to take strike action.     This strike is notable within the sector  as this is the only union branch in the Higher Education to succeed in taking strike action over the 18-19 negotiations. This comes after almost a year of failed negotiations over fair pay  living wage accreditation  closing the gender pay gap  and meaningful negotiations on a joint report of demands written together with the other trade unions on campus  says UNISON today. More than three quarters of the university staff balloted (79 per cent) voted in favour of strike action over last year’s dispute.    Senior managers at the University have persistently refused to negotiate with the unions and instead imposed a below inflation pay rise (2%) on the majority of staff. The University has also been sluggish to address the gulf between men and women’s salaries at the institution  with women earning on average less than 20% than their male counterparts  have refused to accredit  and have only been ready to restructure the pay spine if the unions were prepared to agree on worse conditions such as sick pay  overtime pay  and holiday entitlements.    The first day of action was held on Friday 28th June  on a very sunny day which was also the University's Open Day: food  music  and joyful discussions over everyone’s vision of the University are being held  and prospective students and their parents are finding out about the struggles staff are facing on campus.     In the absence of accreditation  pay at the university could fall below the Real Living Wage  meaning staff would struggle to make ends meet. ‘We already know that members have turned to foodbanks to feed their families’  says UNISON. ‘Many low-paid staff only work 15 hours per week and often hold several jobs to make ends meet. Senior managers seem happy to promote the excellent research undertaken by academics on social inequalities but are failing to see that they are often driving this inequality through the way they treat their own employees’.    Last year  the University set up a new ‘wholly-owned subsidiary company’ called the Edgbaston Park Hotel  and outsourced 40 staff. The Hotel does not recognise unions for new members (meaning that they cannot take strike action  for instance)  and new staff are being paid only £8.21/hour. Their contracts are much worse compared to those of the University of Birmingham’s employees. This year  Hotel staff received a 1p/hour pay rise  while the University’s VC earns £444 000/year from the University  is waiting to receive a one-off £80 000 bonus  and also receives £90 000/year as Chair of the academic and academic related staff’s USS pensions scheme.

As the lockdown is eased  some people will be more aware than others that the pandemic is not over.    The most vulnerable people - those who have been shielded  have been receiving food parcels. They have been advised that they no longer have to shield beyond August 16th. We believe that this means that they will no longer get their weekly food parcel.    We are also aware of other people who for whatever reason  can’t get enough food. Predictions are for greater economic squeezes  which means that more people will fall into this category.    Prior to covid  the office of Leanne Wood in Porth had worked with the free-share scheme to offer free food to people who wanted it: this is food that the supermarkets would normally throw away. This food was provided on a non-means tested basis to anyone who could make use of it. (We also worked closely with the Rhondda foodbank to provide non-perishable food to them that they could make use of for people in need).    This scheme has to be put on hold when covid broke because it was not possible to do it while social distancing.    Social distancing is still an issue  but food poverty and food need is a growing problem. With the shielded group no longer having their weekly food parcel from mid August - and with supermarkets sending food to landfill if it can’t be distributed - all means we need to restart the scheme  but do it differently.    This is where you can help.    We need to raise money - around £5 000 should enable us to operate a scheme up until the end of the year.    We can then purchase extra items so that together with the supermarket excess  we can make up balanced food parcels for anyone who asks for one.    We will be relying on our team of Plaid Cymru councillors as well as the network of volunteers to both pack food and deliver it to people throughout the Rhondda.    If you can donate and also share this link on your social media channels  that would help this new project immensely.    Back in March  nearly six hundred people in the Rhondda responded to a call-out to sign up as a community volunteer  to be a part of a network to support and keep an eye out for others in their community as the covid pandemic took hold and people had major concerns about lockdown.    Some of those volunteers carried out weekly shopping and collected monthly prescriptions for their neighbours all the way through lockdown. This Rhondda network demonstrates what a fantastic community we live in. People here have been through so much with floods  precarious economic conditions  the loss of so many important local services - yet we still band together to help those who need it.

Our family were in awe by his altruistic desire to give  feed and aid ALL  despite race/ethnicity/religion among him even whilst suffering himself.     Since opening  our family alone have vetted 25 families with monthly food rations from December 2019- present. Unfortunately  25 families do not cover the innumerable amount of people starving  for whom we want to share some light  hope and nurture to amidst dark times  that is their indefinite reality.    Our foodbank prioritises poor families with children  single mothers/widowers and those who themselves or their children suffer with debilitating mental/physical health issues trying to make ends meet to provide for their children- this is done with rigorous checks by our team to ensure nobody exploits such a service. The families are issued with a monthly ration card valid for 12 months which provides them with stock for each month as per the individual needs of the family. These include: 10kg chapati flour (atta)  5kg sugar  5kg various lentils/daal  5kg rice  5L cooking oil  tea leaves  salt  spices and other necessary food items. £25 will feed a family of 5 for the month however any donation  no matter how big or small will impact them greatly.     100% of the donationsgo to those in need  with our incredible staff being voluntary workers (so no wages or salaries are deducted from donations) and our facilities funded with the finances that the late Safdar Hussain Shah left behind for us to carry this out in his legacy- we are relying on your kind donations which will solely provide stock for the families.     During the current COVID-19 crisis  we are aiming to try and provide emergency food supplies to all those suffering in the locale  with the most vulnerable holding priority  we are giving out thousands of food rations but are broken to see that we are unable to extend our help to everyone that needs it- as a small start-up charity  we are grateful for all the support and donations we receive in order to help us reach as many individuals suffering from the crisis as possible.     Unfortunately  we can't do this alone  with the power of unity together we can help fill the stomachs of the poor  not only with food but also the fulfilment of life and hope they may gradually receive from your donations. Our brothers and sisters around the globe need us  we are united by our efforts.   Any donation  no matter how big or small will be greatly appreciated especially in the blessed month of Ramadan  whereby charity is considered its greatest.     We are not the givers  we are just Allah SWT  the Almighty's  servants and can only give what he allows and wishes to be given. The families we aim to feed is by the grace of Allah SWT and it is he who provides to all.     May Allah SWT accept this from you and me  may we fulfil our duty by helping those in need  for which it is their right upon you and I.    “A man’s true wealth is the good he does in this world.” Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W)    Instagram: sadaqajariya.foodbank for further updates",False

We are raising money to help provide a free meal to those people and families In Dunfermline who are struggling at this difficult time.     Dunfermline Foodbank is doing a wonderful job as is ""Food for your Future."" However  there is still a great need. Some parents struggling with stress  anxiety and mental health even find it difficult to prepare a meal.    We are aiming to provide 100 FREE meals per day to those who are in need. We are collaborating with local High Schools and primary schools to get the offer to those who could do with a little helping hand right now.    Sometimes the hardest thing for us all to do is to receive a little helping hand from time to time. We are all in this together and we are coming together to try and help in some small way. The sharing of what we have with others is what binds communities together and makes them stronger.    With that in mind we are offering free meals to those in need on a TRIAL 6 DAY period from Tuesday 12th May to Sunday 17th of May.    This had been funded by generous donations and by the Vine church because we all #loveDunfermline.    We are also looking into applying for government funding to do this on a medium to long-term basis.    If you would like to help us keep this service available please consider donating toward our fund.     If you would like to volunteer please do so here    If you want to take advantage of the free meals  or have a friend or family who would want to use this service please click here   Click to register for free meal",False

It was later discovered that John had suffered a brain aneurysm.         Since John’s (Riveley's) passing the family has been inundated with hundreds of messages. Friends  family and loved ones from every aspect of John’s life have been reaching out with sentiments of their own grief and reflections on his life. Upon meeting John  one would immediately discover a gentle  friendly man whose warmth  cheerful demeanour and genuine kindness is unmatched. John touched so many with his humble  unassuming and selfless acts of service. Wherever there was a need you would find John there  not as the centre of attention  but a driving force to make things happen. What you would have also been aware of is John's deep love for God  and that in all things he put his trust in Him to direct his life  no matter what the circumstances. John leaves behind Julie his wife of 18 years and two young sons Caleb and Joshua  aged 8 and 11. John had a big heart with lots of love to give and also leaves behind two current foster sons and several previous foster children who remained a regular part of his life. John was born on the beautiful island of Mauritius and leaves behind his precious mother affectionately known to many as Grandmère; four siblings  Jenny  James  Donald and Shirley (Little Sis); three neices Karisa  Saphea and Nia; and two nephews  Courtnei and Joseph. John was a role model father and devoted son and brother with his eye keenly fixed on the needs of everyone in the family. John’s untimely passing has unfortunately happened at a time when so many are facing emotional and financial challenges. Millions around the world can relate to our experience of sudden loss. Just over a week ago John’s wife would never have expected to face the significant void that John’s death has left in her life. There have been many offers of support and this go fund me appeal is a practical vehicle for individuals to reach out to Julie  Joshua and Caleb at this difficult time as the family makes arrangements to lay John to rest.       The first video attached provides a tiny glimpse of the unfailing love that John had for his children. His youngest son Caleb  attentive  loyal and constantly by his Dad's side  ready to lap up whatever fun and laughter naturally radiated from the heart of his father.       In the second video attached you will witness a celebration of life. The strength you will see as John’s Eldest son Joshua pays tribute to his father publicly within two hours of hearing the sad news of his passing is remarkable. Joshua’s faith demonstrated through his confidence and composure in the face of such loss is a testimony and a legacy of the life of his father Riveley John Michael Choyen. Joshua’s performance flowed out of love for his father and actively testified to the neighbouring community that we mourn  but not as others do  because like our brother John we have the blessed hope of life eternal. John will be sadly missed  but we know that Jesus is coming soon and we will see him again.      Just one week later Joshua and Caleb participated in an online concert “Songs of Hope” to raise money for their local NHS hospital (Croydon University Hospital) and the local foodbank. Their parents have instilled strong values of giving back to the community and these commitments were made before the tragedy struck. In spite of their own grief the boys faithfully participated in the concert dedicating their performance (clip provided below) to their beloved dad.    ",False

We are hoping for 180 people to donate £3.25 each which will pay for enough rice to complete  not one  but two rice challenges!     Every 90kg (90 bags) pays for the farmer in Malawi to send one of his children to secondary school for one year! Education is key in helping families to beat poverty  and a secondary education is so important in helping to achieve that. Sadly  however  this is not an opportunity that is open to all children in Malawi  particularly children in rural  farming communities. We want to help change that by providing farmers with a living income through the sale of their delicious fairly traded rice  as well as giving them the opportunity to send their child to school!    But what are we going to do with all that rice? Every bag purchased will go directly to the Grace Foodbank in Sheffield  which feeds some of the city's most vulnerable and impoverished families.     We know that life is tough for everyone at the moment  but for those in poverty  whether at home or abroad it is even tougher. Why not help two lots of people today and purchase a bag of rice for just £3.25?    Thank you so much for your support!    #fairtradeeveryday",True

See below for some examples of calls we have had this week with the foodbanks... -We have urgent requests for food parcels to be delivered and have only 4 parcels left -We might have to close our doors -We usually make dinners but due to social distancing we need to make lunches but have no food to give out - 22 families arrived today and we had no provisions White Label have partnered with Allens Accountants  Grate Fireplaces in Stockport & Silverchip in Manchester to raise the money and we will ensure the most desperate places receive what they need such as basic food and learning books for the children Approx value of a pack is £20  this will cover a family of 4 for 3 days for 3 meals a day.

A huge drop in food donations coupled with an increase in demand has meant a 50% drop in Warwick District Foodbank's capacity to fill the 160 boxes a week of essential foodstuffs they need to produce.     These cost around £4 500 a week or £18 000 a month.    Please consider making a donation to the Foodbank for as long as the pandemic lasts and share this page in your network.

Each lap is approximately 770 metres  so this will see me cover 100 socially distanced kilometres in 24 hours. All money raised will go to The Trussell Trust #foodbanks    The plan is to run 100 laps on day one between 12 pm and midnight  which will be pretty much back to back marathons. I'll get some sleep  then finish the final 30 laps by midday on the following day. My final lap will be at 11:55 am on the 9th; all being well.... lap number 130.     Due to the current situation food banks are in desperate need of donations  support and help. If you can spare a couple of quid  it would mean the world to both me and this incredible charity. #milesformeals    I'll be posting live updates on Instagram via my mental health support page - Run4YourMind.

Currently  there is a huge need to help support the food banks  as so many people are needing additional help  to put food on the table  which is where the idea came from.    Many people leading up to the bank holiday would be planning where they are going to stay overnight camping or in their vans or on holiday  sadly for the VE-Day weekend that can no longer happen. So why dont we celebrate at home ?    So the idea is simple plan your trip based at home  prepare everything you need to go camping  stay overnight on the drive in your van  a tent in your garden  or even in your house (but it must be set up like a camping trip)  or in your caravan.     So how do we raise funds ?   Donate a minimum of £5 in the pot or the amount you would normally have paid for a night camping at your favourite spot during the bank holiday weekend.  If local to Nailsea  the money will go to food bank in Nailsea  if not to the national food bank network  every £ will make a difference.    Its not just about fundraising  so let's have some fun  go to town decorating your place of accommodation  take pictures  upload them to the Facebook page  use your imagination to have an amazing night or more 'away at home!'",False

With the current situation we find ourselves in due to Covid-19  I have been inspired by the things we have seen our communities doing for each other. Within those communities  you have individuals who may shop  cook or even cut grass for people at risk or our key workers  but then you have pillars of the community such as the Greyfriars that do so much more. Not only do they help individuals with foodbanks as an example  but they are an important part of the Irish heritage and support the community in more ways than some realize. The Greyfriars has been the host to many an amazing night with some great memories with our friends and family. The team are like family to us all  and I know my late mum thought the world of that place and the people that run and drink there  and she always had a great judge of character. If my mum was here now  she would be doing anything she could to help the club and keep it open  she had such great time for that place and the people involved behind the scenes (obvious soft spot for Paul ) With the club being so important to our community  I want to help them as much as possible to allow them to continue to offer what they do for us all. So  that being said  from Monday 18th I am going to challenge myself to run 100km in 30 calendar days to raise as much money as we possibly can for the Greyfriars. That’s 25km a week give or take… as I write this  i am slightly worried for myself. I am just under 20stone and nearly 40 years of age… very much out of shape  so this is going to be a huge challenge for me. I know my mum would be supporting this and be proud of the fact we are pulling together  so when I am hurting (and it will hurt)  this will give me the inspiration I need. Please make it worthwhile by chucking a few quid to this amazing cause. I will post each run on face book  update with photos/videos and keep track of the miles. Your donations will spur me on  lets do this! Thanks for reading  John x",False

My name is Stan Intihar and I am a high school English teacher (and part-time illustrator) here in Edinburgh.    As the situation here (and around the world) worsens  the level of suffering for the patients AND the medical staff trying to help them will become increasingly obvious.    For years I have been involved in the Parent Council Cafes at the schools of both of our children and I have become *moderately* adept at baking scones (insert cheezy smile emoji).    Having 3 asthma sufferers in our family  we have received excellent care from the NHS over the years. Now I plan to show some thanks by setting up a wee ""Scone Stall"" at the exit of the Royal Infirmary at Little France. Upon the presentation of an i.d. badge  the holder will be entitled to a scone (plain  w/ butter  w/butter & jam and gluten-free  if there's enough demand). I will also be asking these staff members what kind of provisions/items would be helpful from a roadside stall. I hope the stall will then expand and develop so that we can show these people that we are behind them.    I will be in need of flour  butter  milk etc.    In addition  I am trying to raise awareness of the situation by designing a number of stickers which will be given away for free. As with the scones  I am only interested in covering my costs. This whole operation is NOT FOR PROFIT. If this is of interest  please check out my web site for updates:     www.stinkdesigns.com    And  depending on the response  I will donate any surplus funds to the Trussell Trust Foodbank.    And...if you want to become directly involved  please get in touch via my website.    If you've read this far. Thank you.    The NHS needs us. Let's show them some love.    Cheers   Stan.",False

Since the outbreak of Covid-19  we have drastically changed the way we are working. We have switched to delivery-only food parcels in Moulsecoomb & Bevendean  and have seen an increase in demand from the first week. With more than 50 households now on our delivery list  we are in constant need of food donations. Many kind people  organisations and businesses have supported us  but to make sure we are able to continue delivering to an ever-increasing amount of households in our area  we are now seeking more support to be able to buy in food and items we desperately need but not always get through donations. We know the need won't end when the outbreak and lockdown is over  and any funding will help us bridge to a way back to our drop-in sessions. We expect that even when the Food bank can open its doors again  and people can come out to socialise and get advice and support in person  the world will still look different  so we want to be prepared for this transition period. Your support is very much appreciated by community we support and the many fantastic volunteers we are supported by. THANK YOU from all of us at the Bevendean Foodbank Committee.

My Dad  James Yule  recently turned 81 and  being on housebound lockdown for 12 weeks  he decided to do Couch to 5k on the back garden path.    (When my friends heard about Major Tom’s 100 laps for NHS  they thought it was my Dad!) Why?  Someone  BP  from a group he’s on  posted on the group page that - even though James didn’t ask for it - BP wants to sponsor him to complete his challenge  and he offered a donation to a charity of James’s choice!    This gave James his altruistic idea - That if people would like to encourage him to do it  by way of sponsorship  and other people can benefit from what he’s doing  then why would he get in the way of such generosity?!    As food and basic health needs are so fundamental/crucial for the people in the world who are most struggling  he would like the raised monies to go to the local food bank and/or care needs in the community.  St. Andrews Foodbank says:    “Those we serve may have lost their job  had a family split up  be victims of domestic violence  or had benefits delayed or suspended. In desperate times we are able to meet their immediate need for food.”  May we extend our human kindness to them.    How?  So  to make it easier for you to give  if you feel inclined  I’ve set up this page.    I will post updates between now and the end of May  by which he hopes to be able to complete a 5km run  actually running  for the half hour that the programme builds runners up to (and do the remainder by whichever means)!    What makes this a challenge  you might ask?   Doesn’t James do the Parkrun?    Indeed  James has done the Parkrun  before  and consistently since my Mum died  a year ago today  20th April.    He also has angina  a heart condition which makes running that bit more challenging for his body. So he will be doing it gradually/sustainably.    His mind/heart  whilst keeping it fit and agile - as well as desiring to support other people in the community to be well and healthy - is determined. How can you help?    With the challenge food banks face in receiving food from their usual sources (church congregations  supermarkets etc)  you giving money to this cause will ensure food banks are stocked  and people who need the support they offer can still access it.    Thank you for your generous support and donations.    Amitaśūrī  and James    ",False

Due to a gap in the area and a desperate need TSY collaborated with few others to collectively reach out to the most vulnerable including single parents  elderly  self isolating and hardship such as loss of income. All our work is voluntary and since March kind donations from local community has assisted us in making sure no one struggled alone. We are running low on cash donations to purchase food to continue this vital support and are reaching out to anyone who can support us by using this link and donating whatever little they can towards the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank project.

Compassionate Acts (registered charity number 1172948) provides many essential and vital services including:    - The Foodbank  - The Pantry  - The Next Steps Cafe  - Debt Advice line  - Welfare advice  - Life Skills Training  - and much more    In March  April and May of 2020 due to Covid19 and lockdown  their usage went up to 80%  so it's incredibly important that we support them in case another surge in usage happens during this second lockdown.    Members will be completing their miles in a number of ways  including an in house competition for 'craziest/most creative miles'! If you have any suggestions or challenges for us  get in touch!

We have secured approx. £75k from Sport England  £25k from The Steve Morgan Foundation and are looking at other ways to raise money to make this project happen. We may need an additional £20k towards the costs of the building but can't approach either funder for more. We have put in over 18 months worth of bid writing  meetings  reports  council applications  lease issues  blood  sweat and tears  to get us to where we are now. We have worked too hard to fall at this final hurdle. The site is used by 2 organisations. The Inclusion Network CIC provide free youth club activities for local young people  free school holiday youth provision  youth projects  community projects  a foodbank session once a week and European project opportunities for y.p's. They are funded by Children In Need  Henry Smith Foundation and several other smaller funders. This is for 48 weeks of the year. I am Colin Murray  one of the directors of this community interest company  and who is asking for your financial support and backing.  Northfield Football Association run approx. 26 junior football teams from ages 5/6 up to 14/15. They have been set up as a charity since the mid 1990's and have engaged and worked with thousands of young people. It is entirely volunteer led and they have an unbelievable group of people that help run it. Between the 2 organisations we provide approx. 18 000 attendances by young people per year (approx. 25 000 if you count the parents that bring them). Now this is the amazing thing and is the reason why I believe we deserve your support...…..we do all of this work from a small converted football changing room/building!!!!!!!!!!!  We have converted the football changing rooms into a small community centre which comprises of a small meeting/group room  small IT room  a small (falling apart) kitchen  a few toilets and a couple of other storage type rooms. We have the basics like light  electricity  gas etc  but we have no central heating  21st century facilities or no real space to engage even more of the community we care about. That's where you come in. We have been working with the 2 nationally recognised funders mentioned at the start of this story (Sport England and The Steve Morgan Foundation) and have secured 100k of their funding towards this project but we are still falling short of the possible build costs of £120k+. We are hoping this crowdfunding page gets us halfway there!!

We are a group of 30 households who have been inspired by the efforts of others to raise awareness for racial inequality and thought we would do our bit to fight against racism in our society. 'Our bit' consists of running the distance of a marathon (whilst observing social distancing) along our road in Bristol for charity.     Our aim is to run/jog/walk 293 lengths of our road (equal to 26.2 miles) for Stopwatch and another charity (see our other webpage that supports Bristol North West Foodbank). Our age range spans from 2 years old to 74 years old with a mix of fitness levels!     Please help support us by donating to Stopwatch one of our chosen charities.     StopWatch is a coalition  which works to:    Promote effective  accountable and fair policing  Inform the public about the use of stop and search  Develop and share research on stop and search and alternatives  Organise awareness raising events and forums  Provide legal support challenging stop and search      Since forming in 2010  StopWatch has led a wide-ranging campaign against the disproportionate use of stop and search  the increasing use of exceptional stop and search powers and the weakening of accountability mechanisms. This includes legal and policy analysis  media coverage and commentary  political advocacy  litigation  submissions to national and international organisations and community organising. The unique mix of academics  activists  young people and lawyers has proved effective at challenging the current use of the tactic and drawing attention to the realities for those on the receiving end of police powers.

It was only small but it made a huge impact on everyone that lived in the community.     Now when you think of a radio station you might think it’s just a place that plays music. This is true  it did play music  but it also did so much more. The reason why it was so special is because it created connections. It made everyone feel like part of the family and really cared. It included everybody  not a soul was left out.     The little station helped everyone in the community as best it could. When singers wanted to sing  it showcased their talents  when local events took place  it promoted them  when charities needed help  it supported them. It helped everyone  but most of all it was a friend  a friend that was always there no matter what time of day.    On a dark dreary day  it was announced the station was to be sold to a big  hairy monster. The community was devastated. The elderly were isolated  the people felt alone and disconnected from one another and the rest of the world.    ‘What a rotten story!’ I hear you cry. I agree. It’s pretty rubbish  but it’s a true story.    I live in the smallest County in England – Rutland. I worked at the special station that was unfortunately taken over by the hairy monster in question. However  I have been inundated with requests to start a new station… Can you help me?        The station was a friend to so many people  but it also helped a heap of charities. It promoted the foodbanks so those in need can get access  it promoted the Good and New Clothes Sale  which funded the Citizen’s Advice Bureau in Oakham  it promoted Second Helpings so we can reduce our food waste and feed bellies instead  it promoted Mindspace Stamford so we can connect with our fellow human beings through art and reading classes.

We would like to ask you to join us in helping to provide essential food parcels for vulnerable families in Medellin.     Many families are facing serious hardship and do not have the basic necessities due to the current government enforced lockdown.     People are struggling to buy food and have no income.     The current measures here mean that for many people it is impossible to work at the moment. Here there is not a support system in place to help people who cannot work or feed their families  or buy medicine.     We are deeply concerned for the welfare of the families that we work with  the children that we teach English to and the mothers that we spend Wednesday afternoons with in our women’s programme – as well as many other families that at the moment are in a really desperate position.     The lockdown has already lasted a month and the future is uncertain.     Huellas (Footprints)  the foundation we volunteer with are receiving donations and working with the city’s foodbank to deliver food parcels directly those most in need. Huellas have been operating for 10+ years and know the needs of the local area and families (a number of the volunteers live in the area too). They are so dedicated and the team’s response to the crisis has been amazing – finding innovative ways to educate the community to stop the spread of Covid-19 and providing food parcels.     Please help them continue supporting some of the most vulnerable families in the city and we can make sure that the children and mothers we work with  and the wider community  have food. If you have had the chance to visit Colombia  or know Colombians  you will know what warm  generous and kind-hearted people they are  and right now they really need some support.     We know that this is an incredibly difficult and uncertain time for everybody and that lots of people are already supporting charities that they care about. We are so lucky in the UK to have the NHS and a social welfare system that we can use. Many of these families have nothing and for most of us  the difficulties they are facing are unimaginable. You could really make a difference.     All of the money collected goes directly to the foundation who support the families directly by providing basic food supplies. As little as £5 could really help.     Please do donate if you can... and check out our instagram page to see what we have been up to!     https://www.instagram.com/somosfundacionhuellas/",False

Foodbanks  in particular  are being hit very hard during these days of panic buying so I'm looking to raise funds for both the Sunderland East End & Newcastle West End Foodbanks. The story about the Egg  it had been £550 and was on display in Fenwicks Newcastle  made by Charbonnel et Walker  one of Britain’s first and finest chocolatiers. It stands at about 500mm tall and has a circumference of about 1m. It's a mountain of some of the best chocolate in the world. Due to the Covid-19 virus  Fenwicks (a Newcastle institution) had announced it was closing down during this period for the safety of both its staff and customers  as a consequence it was also reducing all of its easter products. So how do I have it and what's the plan?     Having literally called in for something for my dinner that evening  then wondering why the food hall was so busy? I noticed in both the chaos and panic buying the easter products at discounted prices.     I also noticed this mother of all Easter Eggs Big Bertha (one of the biggest Easter Eggs in the Country) and its discounted price. Bargain  but there was no way I could eat it all but could there be a way that we could feed many more from this opportunity and some good news could come from both of these situations... I then cracked open a plan. Make a donation  I have set a minimum donation of £1 but you can donate whatever amount you like. You can make multiple donations to increase your chances or just be a kind person and make one. A name will be drawn at random by BBC Radio Newcastle either on the day Fenwicks reopens it doors or by the 8th April at the latest  in time for it to be delivered for Easter.     Let's make this a good news story for everyone as sharing is the new caring. Thanks for your support   Ian ",True

That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks  supported by The Trussell Trust  working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.    ABOUT OUR FOODBANK  An introduction to the Morecambe Bay Foodbank project.  Morecambe Bay Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. It began life at the GYM Church on Green Street in Morecambe and has now moved to The West End Community Centre on Westminster Road in Morecambe. We receive and distribute over six tonnes of food each month and our operation has been growing since its inception in 2012.     We have a small staff team led by our Foodbank Manager  Annette Smith  and over eighty regular volunteers who give up their time to help us each week.    ABOUT  HOW FOODBANKS WORK  Providing emergency food to people in crisis.  Every day people in the UK go hungry for reasons ranging from redundancy to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems.    FOOD IS DONATED  Schools  churches  businesses and individuals donate non-perishable  in-date food to a foodbank. Large collections often take place as part of Harvest Festival celebrations and food is also collected at supermarkets.    FOOD IS SORTED AND STORED  Volunteers sort food to check that it’s in date and pack it into boxes ready to be given to people in need. Over 40 000 people give up their time to volunteer at foodbanks.    PROFESSIONALS IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN NEED  Foodbanks partner with a wide range of care professionals such as doctors  health visitors  social workers and police to identify people in crisis and issue them with a foodbank voucher.

We have been operating since 2012 in London and became a charity in March 2020. Information about SWAN can be found on our website www.swanlondon.org. We run a foodbank and provide community support to many Refugee and migrant families in London. We have also been providing aid to refugees in Camp Moria since 2018 in partnership with Kitrinos Healthcare and Team Humanity who are both charities registered to work in Greece. We have collected  sent (via container) and provided vital humanitarian aid to Refugees in Moria camp including food parcels  baby milk  nappies  clothes  shoes and blankets and documented the distributions on social media (WhatsApp). Team Humanity are our implementing partner on the ground and they have distributed regular food parcels to new arrivals on our behalf. In recent months there has been a dramatic increase in the number of new arrivals and conditions are horrendous. Many families are living in inhumane conditions with little or new food. Since November 2019 SWAN - with the help of TEAM HUMANITY has been providing bread (which is prepared by Refugees) in the camp to starving refugees in and outside Moria Camp. The cost of preparing each bread is 40 cents. €400 provides 1000 breads. There are currently 21 000+ refugees in Moria and many new arrivals have no funds and the queues are so long for the food provided by the Greek authorities and local charities that many get nothing. All funds received for this campaign will be sent to our implementing partner Team Humanity to pay for preparation and distribution of the bread. The ground team send pictures of each distribution to SWAN which we share with donors for transparency. The bread we distribute is often all they will eat. SWAN aim to provide bread three times a week - £1200. If we could do more we would. But we are a small charity dependent on your support.

We are fortunate to have secured a premises rent free  but the need for food is increasing so funds are needed now more than ever. The £10000 we are hoping to raise will keep our shelves well stocked for the next six months and allow us to invest in a range of training for our volunteers  introduce more grants and support schemes for our service users and maybe even secure a van to enable our service to travel. We are fairly unique amongst food banks in that we do not limit the number of food parcels someone can access in a year  we accept self referrals and also offer fresh food that includes fruit and vegetables  cheese  milk and a range of frozen foods in addition to the usual ambient packets. We also try and offer our service users a degree of choice to ensure a sense of dignity and we provide advice  guidance and onward referrals where needed.

I'm raising money in aid of Sussex Community Development Association Food Bank and every donation will help. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to me.      The Mayor of Peacehaven  Cllr. Claude Cheta has launched a campaign asking residents to donate either a tin or jar of food which will be delivered to the Seahaven Food Bank.  Cllr. Cheta has picked this charitable organisation to support whilst in post as Mayor.    Peacehaven Town Council are open for donations every weekday morning at Community House  Meridian Centre; however  we understand that the normal way of life has drastically changed over the past three months and it may be difficult to carry out a shopping trip to the supermarket. Bearing this in mind  we have also set up a GoFundMe so you can donate to the Mayor’s appeal without having to leave the house.    Either way it will help this vital cause. The Seahaven Foodbank covers the Havens which includes Peacehaven clients.    Seahaven Foodbank  also known as Newhaven Foodbank  provides food parcels to families and individuals in Newhaven  Sussex  and the surrounding areas.  The falloff in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that the food bank has had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one-week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries.  All donations to the Mayor’s GoFundMe page will go directly to the food bank.

No Judgement. Nobody Should be Hungry.      The Deli Group have launched our Christmas Campaign - www.nobodyshouldbehungry.co.uk - offering FREE Christmas Dinners for those in need across the St Helens and Newton-Le-Willows areas.     We're funding this ourselves as much as we are able to  working in conjunction with many of our key suppliers  however lots of incredibly kind and generous customers  friends and neighbours have asked about contributing so that we can help even more people.    We've always been clear that we're not a charity  and we were reluctant to become involved with handling donations as it's so easy for good intentions to be misconstrued or misinterpreted where money is concerned. Having said that  we realise that there is only so much we can do with our own limited resources and the goodwill of our suppliers  so having taken some advice we've set up this GoFundMe page as a means to transparently collect any contributions which you wonderful people may like to make towards this initiative.    To keep things as transparent and open as possible  we've also opened an entirely separate  ring fenced bank account - and we will regularly share details of any contributions and expenditure both here and via our Dentons Deli and Newton Deli social media accounts.    As we've no idea what the cost of providing these meals will be until all bookings are confirmed  it's difficult to set a budget or to stop accepting contributions once the cost has been met  therefore again to keep things open and to ensure that nobody benefits unfairly from the generosity of others  we've decided to donate any surplus to St Helens Foodbank  and again we will share details of this publicly.    Thank you all so very much for your help and support. By working together  we can make such a difference to the lives of those locally who may otherwise be hungry this Christmas.           Please see below details of the campaign -     For many years we’ve not sent Christmas cards or gifts outside of our immediate family  instead giving a donation either of money or our time to charity  to help those in need.    This year  we’ve decided to try to do our bit in ensuring that nobody living locally has to go hungry. Whatever the reasons  and putting politics and judgement aside  far too many people - both adults and children - are going without the food they need to live  which is totally unacceptable when so many have far more than they need. We may not have a lot ourselves  but what little we have we’d like to share to hopefully make things a little easier for others.    So  The Deli Group are pleased to announce the launch of our “Nobody Should Be Hungry” campaign - www.nobodyshouldbehungry.co.uk    If you’re finding things a struggle  or you know somebody who is  we’d like to invite you to book a FREE Christmas Dinner  which will be freshly prepared and delivered on Monday 23rd December between 4pm and 8pm. All meals will be delivered hot and ready to eat  or can be safely kept and re-heated on Christmas Day.    Book online now at www.nobodyshouldbehungry.co.uk - we’re going to work with our suppliers to provide as many meals as we can  but places will be limited both by availability and the time it will take to prepare and deliver so many meals  therefore please book early to avoid disappointment.    Both adult and child sized portions are available  along with the option to collect from our Newton Deli shop or for the meals to be delivered to you at home.    No Questions  No Judgement. NOBODY should EVER be hungry.    Love from Viv  Marc and all of the Deli Group team. x x",False

I can in some small way understand the fear and worry people would face without this resource. As someone often in the church building  I see first-hand people (often not the ones we 'picture' in our minds)  but everyday hard-working families  people like us  who just need a helping hand. SO I went to Tesco to buy some food for us hoping to donate some too. But there was no food to give so I thought I could give my donation in financial terms - thus allowing Yeovil Christian Support Trust to top up their own surplus and use my gift as they require. Perhaps you would consider doing the same. Could you spare a fiver to help top up the food bank and other groups the Lords larder helps. The church link is https://yeovilcommunitychurch.co.uk and the charity is www.ycstyeovil.org.uk and ALL donations will go directly to them... helping provide food parcels and support all manner of clients in OUR town.   Because who knows in this day and age  when we may need it ourselves. Thank You. I've set the target but would love to see that broken - plus I'm happy to accept silly challenges for money!!

Through this site as well as other private donations  we raised a total of £2 215 (Q 22 747 Guatemalan Quetzales). Amazing!!!    It is time I reported back more fully on how your generous contributions are being spent.    So far  from this money  we have spent 8566 Quetzales (roughly £834) on medical examinations  care  medication and journeys. Details of these expenses can be seen below. During the process of working with the family  several issues have come to light  mostly the extreme poverty in which they have been living. Their home  which is made of sheets of corrugated iron  is very poorly constructed. It is covered in a sheet of plastic which offers insufficient protection from the weather  continually subjecting the house (and its contents) to damage from rain and flooding. The family also has no access to clean water  which has resulted in poor health  parasites and stomach infections. With regards to the operations we believed were necessary  it turns out that only Alex  the older boy  needs surgery. Alex has  however  chosen to wait until the pandemic lessens because the public hospitals continue to prioritise COVID-19 patients and it is deemed unsafe for non COVID patients. The good news is that the medical examinations showed us that the surgery appears not to be as urgent as previously believed. We will  therefore  wait until there is more capacity in the hospitals to treat non-COVID patients. It has also been agreed by the hospital  that when it does take place  the surgery can be performed without cost. We  therefore  have £1 382 to aid the family in other ways. After much discussion with the family and careful consideration  we have decided to spend your donations as follows. I hope you will support the proposal:-    Asociación Vida will be supporting the family to make improvements to their home  in particular to the roof. The estimated cost for these improvements is £563. They will also install an electric water pump system to enable them to access clean water at the push of a button (cost: £205). Doña Felipa has  unfortunately  accrued some debts as a result of their struggle to survive  and are being hounded constantly to repay the debts. We have agreed to pay off their debts which amount to £390. To help the family to avoid the need for any loans in the future  we have offered to give them £146 in order to help the mother start up an embroidery business. We are also spending £78 on necessary medical care. Asociación Vida are committed to supporting this family as they get back on their feet. As soon as Alex feels that he is happy to go ahead with the surgery  and if it is still deemed necessary  Asociación Vida will support him in journeys to the hospital and so on.    Details of the expenses and budget for the next stage of support can be found below. I know the destination of your donations has changed somewhat  but I hope that you will agree that it will go a long way in helping the family. Photos to follow in due course.

As well as running a medical centre  they work with some of the poorest communities to improve health  nutrition and living conditions. Patzún  where I lived has a lot of poverty and now  with the current pandemic  this situation has only worsened. As in the UK  people have been unwell or died from the virus and many people have found themselves unable to work - only in Guatemala there is no furlough scheme  no NHS  no foodbank and no benefits of any kind. If a household has absolutely no food  they are draping a white flag out of their home (or just holding it up in the street if they are homeless) and the village will do what they can to share their food.    Through friends of mine living in Patzún  I have recently been introduced to a widow  named Doña Filipa. She lives in a home made of corrugated iron with her three sons  Alex (17 years)  Edy (14) and Jonatan (11). The elder two boys used to help their mother with living costs by doing whatever work they could – manual work  selling ice-creams and so on. However  a month ago (on 6th May)  the sons were out collecting wood for their mother when they slipped and fell 25 metres down a ravine  resulting in one boy having a serious hip and rib injury and the other boy with broken legs. They are bed-ridden and both urgently need medical attention and operations. However  as there is no NHS in Guatemala  they would need to pay the hospital £2000 for this to take place  which is simply not possible.     We have already managed to raise some of this amount  but I wondered if  by sharing their story here  some of my lovely friends might be willing to contribute a small amount towards helping this family out. The money will be sent to Asociación Vida*  who will oversee any support we can offer this family – ideally enabling the sons to receive all the medical attention they need. Any help would be wonderful. If you want more detail about this  please message me – I just didn’t want to write too much on here. Thank you    *Asociación Vida is a registered charity  partnered by Tearfund UK.       Update: 3rd July 2020    I am so grateful to report that we have already raised over £500 towards this cause. Thank you so much for your generosity. The last few days have been spent taking the boys to the clinic in Patzún for some medical checks - and also to the hospital in Chimaltenango for X-rays and consultations with an orthopaedic specialist. The outcome of this visit is that Edy  the younger of the boys  needs an operation to correct the bones that have started to set in the wrong position since the accident took place two months ago. This operation is going to cost 20 000 Quetzales (about £2 085). The elder boy  Alex  will have an MRI scan on his back tomorrow (4th July) and from there a decision will be made about the treatment required. If you are in a position to give anything... we'd be so grateful. If you are not in a position to give financially  we would so value your prayers for these boys. Thank you so much xx      Update: 16th July    Thank you so much for your all your donations. We have all been blown away by your generosity :o)    We are still awaiting an appointment with the neuro specialist (re-scheduled for this Friday) to discuss the findings from Alex’s MRI scan. It is feared he may have serious spinal injuries  which could lead to paralysis. However  due to the COVID 19 outbreak  travelling to the capital for these appointments  amidst the government restrictions  is not proving to be easy at all.    If you are the praying type  please pray that nothing prevents this appointment with the specialist from taking place this Friday. Give thanks for all the money that has been donated and pray that it will be sufficient for both boys to receive the operations and treatment they need.    Thank you so much!      Update: 25th July    Thank you so much to everyone who has donated to this cause. Your generosity has been overwhelming.    Since my last update  the pandemic in Guatemala has worsened as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increase daily alongside the number of deaths caused by the virus. The Government’s very strict lockdown measures have also made it difficult for the boys to be taken to their hospital appointments in the capital  with police issuing fines to people who travel even for medical purposes. Nevertheless  both boys have finally received the results from their X-rays and MRI scans  which were able to take place thanks to your donations. Alex requires the most urgent surgery  as his spinal injuries could easily lead to paralysis. We await news from the hospital about when this can take place. Unfortunately  the Roosevelt hospital  where the procedure will happen  is rampant with COVID-19  with many members of staff and patients having died from the virus. This is obviously of great concern to the family  who  therefore remain somewhat nervous about their upcoming treatment.    If you are the praying type  please pray that the operations will take place soon – and for protection  healing and restoration for the whole family. Amazingly  we should have some surplus money from your donations  so Asociación Vida are making plans to offer further support to this family as well as to others who are also in great need. Please pray for wisdom for them as they seek to best meet the needs of their community at this very pressing time.    Matiox Chawe!

The fundraising campaign will support a range of local voluntary  community and faith sector organisations who are working tirelessly to help vulnerable residents across the borough.    As a key organisation of the Sefton Borough  we at Hugh Baird College believe we can assist in the fundraising effort by calling on the kindness and generosity of our students  staff  alumni  the local community and other organisations the College works closely with.

Initially we developed single portion healthy pots of food to be microwaved at home to give some practical help to families. After running a survey of our parents  it became very evident that this product would help all families in the exact same position  but with less financial resource. At this point we began donating 1 pot for every 10 pots we sell to a family in need.

It has been a very long lonely poverty-stricken journey. I have tried to impact my community through volunteering in different capacities since I am not allowed to engage in any paid activities.     However  I am so limited in what I can offer  I have a language barrier. Moving to this area of England and volunteering in what is to be a foreign language has been challenging  and the experience has given me an appreciation of how languages work and how they are a vital part of our everyday experience. I hope to develop a greater intellectual understanding of languages by taking a course in French studies.     Unfortunately  I cannot afford to sponsor myself.    I am raising money for my tuition which is £500.00 and £500.00 for learning materials. I have applied for this course in the university and have till the 17th December to pay the tuition as the school will not reserve a place for me without payment According to the school  there will be studying materials we will need to purchase for a better understanding of the course but they are not yet known until our first lecture in January 2021.    I am a hard worker and have enjoyed the character-building experiences that life in the UK has to offer. During the first national lockdown  I have volunteered at hospitals and underground tube stations  presently involved with the FoodBank  an experience that I found very rewarding. I enjoyed directing and assisting visitors and participating in activities such as training  distributing facial masks  shopping for the vulnerable and the needy. I have developed a greater awareness of the world around me  as a result of both the experience of moving to a new country and my volunteering activities. Inspired by this I plan to become more closely involved in various voluntary causes which I believe make a crucial difference to the local and global community.     I am a member of the London Squad Volunteers for the UEFA EURO 2020 which will require me to come in contact with people from different countries. I am also planning to volunteer with Princes Alice and to become involved in fundraising activities. These interests and experiences have led me towards being interested in learning an additional language and I feel that the themes studied in a French course and the skills acquired would give me great help in preparing me for these roles and pave career paths for me. It will also help me to be occupied and busy and engage with people and the community. I appreciate your time in contributing to this fund. I’m looking forward to becoming a French student.

And seeing as no one is going anywhere fast at the moment I thought the Cohawk seemed a good idea.     Let's face it... A couple of weeks and it will have grown back.         As you can see I've already taken the challenge  and yes! I need to sack the hairdresser.

""When I was a child like many growing up  I suffered from a lack of confidence and belief within myself  at the time and even to this day I was amazed and overwhelmed by HOW BIG and SCARY this world could be to a child raised in a single-parent household. I was told never to expect too much from myself. But my mother imparted me with a very important life lesson that I now follow to this day and that is  ""In order to be a leader you must first learn to love and lead yourself.""    I know now  that time has come  for me now and this is my announcement to the rest of the world  that I'm ready to lead this world into a new era of posperity and unity. A world where we are connected through our pride and success of how far we've come together  instead of a world hindered by our differences.    WHY I NEED YOUR HELP ?    I want to use my experience   talents and skillsets to empower young and old black people from across the world through global development and green technology.    I will help fulfil and unkept legacy and help the people of Africa and the Carribean  to realise the potential within them.    HOW WOULD I ACCOMPLISH THIS ?    Providing a continental high class quality education system that is free for all of its citizens.    Utilise Green technology to begin to address the solutions that can be made for ensuring a future for all the world and its inhabitants.    Providing free electricity and access to the internet for all nations in Africa and the Carribbean.    A continent united under one constitution.    A country where our resources and talents are not exploited and abused by corporations that do not hold the interests of the people or its land.    A nation where poverty  war and social-economic exploitation is a thing of the past.    A continental foodbank that can address hunger and be used in cases of national disaster and emergency.    A continent that supports the art of learning  intergrity and the pursuit of truth just as much as its academia.    A nation that can be called HOME for its citzens and descendants all over the world.    A continent that loves its people and doesn't suffer from the actions of leaders that abuse their power.    To create solutions for major diseases affecting African lives  including malaria and HIV/AIDS.    This is the grand vision that I have for the people that I care so much about  but in order to do that I first need your help ! Regardless of whether its through financial help  wisdom or networking  I have a vision to create a better world that isn't just about myself or what I can gain out of this  that's why any advice and support is just as greatly appreciatied.    WHY AM I DOING THIS ?    I want to create a world where we stop protesting about being shot  killed or mistreated and can begin to celebrate the evolution of how powerful we truly are and how far we've come. I know I am not the first to have thought of all these ideals but I know I will be the first to deliver them for the benefit of others.      I would like to thank anyone that has read this far  and I wish nothing but the best for you and your loved ones. I am only one mind  but I would appreciate any exchange of thoughts and ideas to build a better world.    Below are a list of the commitments that I will make to the people who are kind enough to aid me in my goals  I've also attached a document of why I am qualified for the role.    If I exceed my targets for my crowdfunding  I will take my first initative by providing new built homes and foodbanks to the people of Libya and Haiti as part of my start-up initative charity and think-tank called Heaven estates.com    Thank you for your time !

All proceeds raised will be split between the two causes. Fund raising causes: NI Scrubs - This is a volunteer group set up to help frontline NHS staff with protective clothing and scrubs which they are currently short on supplies. Money raised will help towards fabric costs and sourcing and then distributed to a group of volunteers who make the clothing for our amazing frontline staff. This will help them deal with this crisis in a safe  protected  environment. Dundonald Foodbank - Foodbank branches across the UK have been providing a valuable service to those on low income needing help to feed themselves and their familes for a number of years. Now more than ever they need our help to help those most in need. A cash donation will enable them to buy much needed food and items that are low on stock.

The hair dye ended up taking 4 weeks to arrive  by which point he’d changed his mind. The moment had passed and it seemed pointless.     To encourage him to do it again  my Mum and I thought we needed a reason to make him do it and decided that with so much going on in the world right now  we could try and make the tiniest bit of difference by doing it for charity; My mum is now jumping on the bandwagon and dying her hair too.     Now I’m fully aware that he’s not jumping out a plane  running a marathon or shaving his head but he’s 74 so give him his due. It would be fantastic if anyone could donate literally ANY amount  even a pound - I’m a self employed singer in a Global Pandemic. I FEEL YOU.     The money raised will be split evenly between two very worthy causes at this time;    THE BLACK CURRICULUM    ‘The Black Curriculum is a social enterprise founded in 2019 by young people to address the lack of Black British history in the UK Curriculum. We believe that by delivering arts focused Black history programmes  providing teacher training and campaigning through mobilising young people  we can facilitate social change.’    THE TRUSSELL TRUST FOOD BANK NETWORK    ‘We don’t think anyone in our community should have to face going hungry. That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks  supported by The Trussell Trust  working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.‘    I’d like to think that even if we raised £50 we have done it for good reason and tried to support these causes in any way we can when we’re on lockdown!

Back before all this madness started I sillily signed myself up to do my first ever half marathon  the Hackney Half on the 17th May  SO when coming into lockdown I decided that although this event was likely to be cancelled  I would still like to try and push myself to run the distance on the original date and hopefully raise a bit of money for a worthwhile charity that needs support more than ever.     I am not a runner and it has been a painful slog trying to motivate and keep training. In less than 2 weeks I'm going to attempt the 21K that I would have been running in Hackney and hope that the cheering from my family will be enough to get me round the course as opposed to the huge crowds that would have been at the real event!     I'd like to raise some money in aid of The Trussell Trust an amazing charity that supports UK food banks and every donation will help. At the moment 81% more emergency food parcels being given out across the UK  including 122% more parcels going to children compared to this time last year.    I know so many people have used food as a means to brighten up their quarantine so I think it is so important that this is shared to those who are struggling to feed their families and even put one meal on their table a day. Anything you can donate would be hugely appreciated and will hopefully help keep a family fed throughout these uncertain times.     I'll be posting the death of my running career on the 17th and knowing that we've been able to support others in need will hopefully help me get round the distance!!

I have also become aware that during Lockdown  Mark Cavendish (he’s a professional cyclist for those who haven’t heard of him) had completed a Virtual Everesting. The idea behind this is to complete a bike ride where the vertical climb is the same as the summit of mount Everest by going up and down the same stretch of road as many times as it takes to complete the 8849 meter ascent of Everest. And because I am an idiot  this sounded like something I should attempt.    Claire  Aidan and Emmy have suggested that if they are going to give up the front room of our home for a day (I’m aiming to finish it in 14hrs) then the least they should get out of it is the knowledge that some money was raised for a good cause not just pandering to my stupidity in the face of a challenge.

My life has been privileged and compared to most  easy. So instead of getting drunk on cheap wine and eating cake  I will play video games for 12 hours & raise money for two foundations that are near to my heart.     First up - Stand Against Racism & Inequality. For those who are unaware  my half-brother is black. We were adopted when we were younger  and out of our many siblings  the majority of them are black. Living in a small Illinois town they were an oddity  and racism did exist. Not a day goes by where my family & I do not worry about each other  but we worry more about the ones who can be murdered for just being black in a white world.     50% of the donations that are raised over the course of the fundraiser will be donated to Stand up Against Racism & Inequality.     You can learn more about the charity by visiting their website: https://www.sariweb.org.uk/who-we-are/about-sari/      This is not a Black Lives Matter only organization  but helps with all racism  bigotry  and sexism. But their focus is helping victims of hate crimes  and with those on the rise in the UK we can all agree that its a good cause.       The second foundation is Paddington Partnership: https://www.thisispaddington.com/paddington-partnership/about-us    They work with businesses in the Paddington area to raise money  donate their time and help out at some of the less fortunate areas of Paddington. This is interesting because our Building we work in is about 50 Million  but if I cross the street and walk 3 minutes  there's a crap block of flats full of people struggling. Paddington Partnership takes the privileged workers in these fancy offices & pairs them with programs and events to help those in need.     My team at work read with the students of King Solomon Academy every week  and have for nearly 3 years now. I personally run a monthly bookclub at the Marlybone Woman's shelter where we're currently reading David Sedaris.    On top of that  every year 3-4 groups get together to help in the community in various ways. Food banks  Soup Kitchens  putting a party on for Halloween or even gardening & cleaning the school grounds.     50% of the proceeds will be sent to Paddington Partnership to be split 3 ways between the following:    King Solomon Academy:https://kingsolomonacademy.org/about-us/welcome-2  The Marlybone Project: https://www.maryleboneproject.org.uk/  The North Paddington Foodbank: https://www.npfoodbank.org.uk/      If you are able to donate  I would appreciate it.

Previously known as North Warwickshire Food Bank  Edible links uses food surplus to reduce poverty  stress and diet related ill health. They run a food bank and provide community groups with food enabling them to help more local people. This year they will be providing over 250 food hampers to families in need across Warwickshire. And are also running a campaign to encourage people to sponsor a Christmas present for a child in Northern Warwickshire.

We started off supporting Food Banks with large quantities of food items which were about to go to waste  donated to us by a company. Since then we have formed alliances with organisations and churches and have continued the work of supporting Food Banks.    The need is so great that the queues at Food Banks seem to be ever growing  so we decided to make it our priority to encourage the setup of more Food Banks in local areas.     To this end  we have now embarked on opening a Food Bank in Leyton E10. This will serve as a Food Bank  Soup Kitchen and a Distribution Hub as we continue to work with other organisations and Food Banks to cater for those in need.     As a community  in one of the world's richest countries  food poverty should never happen. COVID-19 has left individuals unemployed  feeling isolated  vulnerable and  as a result  hungry. Many people are embarrassed to say they have nothing to eat and with a 2nd lockdown now in place  we have already started to notice a spike in the number of people accessing Food Bank services once again.     Currently  we receive free perishable items 4 times a week but we would like to raise funds for non perishable items: pasta  rice  tin foods etc. which we can give to people in need for free. We are sure that you might have supported your local Food Bank in the past by donating items directly to them or putting extra items in the food trolleys at your local supermarket - this Gofundme initiative takes the hassle out of you purchasing the items and getting them to a Food Bank as we do the purchasing and if we are able to bulk purchase  then we will attract greater discounts from wholesalers which in turn means we can purchase and distribute more food items.     With Christmas coming up  no person or family should go hungry and we are asking for your support by making a donation to help us ensure that happens.     No amount is too small or too large  but £10 can contribute greatly to feeding an individual for a week.     Please support so that everyone can have a Merry Christmas!

I spent these 15 years following God’s guidance step by step. I set up a soup kitchen  which then became a charity  which went on to become a foodbank  clothing bank  supported living accommodation et al. This all culminated in me receiving a British Empire medal from the Queen and the charity winning the Queen’s Award for voluntary service. You can see the video of my journey of faith below.    Unfortunately  as a result of working 80+ hours a week   I then became ill. I took time out to recuperate and find myself; I had lost myself in the work. I visited two Christian retreats and it was at these centres that I encountered the powerful way that creativity could be used in the healing process. God can speak through anything; pictures  poetry  woodwork  needlework  gardening and more.    My Creative Journey Begins    It became apparent that my time in the charity was over. God had me on the next part of my journey. I started a creative group called Come to the Table. This group met once a fortnight. We gathered around a large table to eat  talk  pray and create. It helped many people in different ways. Connection and creativity worked hand in hand to help and heal. However  when the lockdown happened it was no longer possible to meet like this.    Creativity and Coaching    The Lord spoke to me one Sunday when I was in church (prior to Covid) and told me to offer someone one to one creative sessions. I had never done these one to one creative sessions with anyone before and the Lord had to ask me three times before I said YES. Before the first session I was very nervous and had no idea what to do. But God gave me a download of exactly what I should do and I was amazed at how the creative sessions impacted my client’s life. Every session since  God has given me the exact creative activity to do and I have seen healing and freedom come from these sessions.    My online coaching course required me to find two people to practice with. Straight away it came to me to ask the person I had been doing creative one to one sessions with. She said YES. And so Creative Coaching was born in my life.    Both my clients have been helped enormously through this process. Both of them had previously been to see counsellors and clinical professionals. But creative coaching offered something new and different that helped them to become free.    In this I have seen God work through me to reach others with long term mental health issues. I stand amazed. By word of mouth I have other people interested in doing creative coaching. I know the Lord is using me in a mighty way.     What Next?    What I need now in order to proceed and help many more people is a studio to deliver Creative Coaching. A self contained  secure  comfortable and readymade creative environment where folk can come and feel safe and get individual attention.     The studio comes in parts and is moveable so it is future proof!    I believe the Lord asked me to set up a Go Fund Me page and gave me the specific target figure of £17 000 to cover; the cost of a studio with electrics and the remedial work like clearing the ground and laying a flat base. This is really stepping outside of my comfort zone. I have again given God my YES and wait to see what happens.    I now need help in pursuing the next stage of my journey  again helping people but this time using coaching and creativity. After spending 15 years volunteering for the charity (1 year paid)  I feel God is wanting me to make this my ministry. Yes  I will be making a charge for this service  but up until now I have given freely of my time. I will continue to do free sessions for those who can’t afford to pay.    I have seen the results that creative coaching has had and relish the opportunity to help many more people. I want to pursue what really matters; the opportunity to help rebuild people’s lives. Some have been stuck for many  many years. To see the effects that creative coaching is having is absolutely astounding. Only God could do this.    Why would you sow into this?    You would not only be sowing into my life by providing a space to work from but also be sowing into the lives of others who need help to walk into freedom. This is a unique opportunity for you to make a difference in someone else’s life. Will you give it your YES?    I will be making regular updates and hope to make a video of the studio site before  during and after.    Please watch the short films of two people's accounts of how creative coaching has impacted their lives.    Thank you.    Amelia      Creative Coaching Client recommendations:    1:1 Creative Coaching Sessions  I have now completed 5 coaching sessions with Amelia. Each session has been specifically designed to address the coaching focus in question  and in my case involves a creative activity.  I have been astounded by Amelia’s ability to produce relevant activities which help me to focus on  and talk through  the issues in question. The process of creating makes it easy to share with Amelia the sometimes emotional aspects of the issues I am addressing. It particularly helps me to identify how I am feeling and what I believe and think about an aspect of my life. This then enables me to address and change any wrong thinking. Throughout this process Amelia brings wisdom and presents challenge in a safe  calm environment. I would highly recommend Amelia as a coach.  Beth     Life Coaching  When I first started this life coaching course with Amelia I had very little expectation of it being able to help me. I have been a Christian for a long while and have sought help many times with little or no results ( except disappointment) . However I can honestly say that in the weeks that Amelia has been coaching me  my life has turned around. I am beginning to think differently and I am acting differently. Amelia doesn’t say very much but she does listen and gives me pointers to direct my thoughts and feelings in alignment with the word of God. The visual things she gets me to do  although simple  they have a great impact on me. I am so thankful to God for allowing me to do this course with such a spirit filled loving person who genuinely cares for the people she coaches.   Many  many  thanks to Amelia for all of the time and prayers that she puts into helping me and so many others.  Rosie    I want to make a difference  A Poem Written by Amelia E Luffrum    I want to make a difference  To everyone I meet  I want to make a difference  To people in the street.    I want to make a difference  To everyone I know  I want to make a difference  Everywhere I go.    I want to make a difference  To friends and loved ones too  I want to make a difference  Especially to you.    I want to make a difference  To show I really care  I want to make a difference  A moment just to share    I want to make a difference  In the things I do and say  I want to make a difference  In a positive way.    So if I’ve made a difference  In even the smallest way  Then you too can make a difference  In someone else’s day.      To find out more about my journey  take a look at the video below:    ",False

From giving someone a home  to helping them to get the right mental health support  we support people at the moment of crisis and enable them to build a life beyond a crisis. We are supported by more than 460 volunteers across London who provide specialist skills such as art therapy  yoga  IT  gardening & cooking  as well as befriending & fundraising.    Lockdown has been challenging for everyone  but for those living with profound trauma  coronavirus has heightened fears and prolonged recovery. Children in Hestia’s refuges have been isolated from friends  school and any sense of normality after escaping abusive households. Unable to run around and play  they have been confined to their bedrooms for their safety. We fear this could result in a long-term impact on their mental health and education.     How you can help    That is why Hestia is launching the Summer Wellbeing Programme (a change on their usual Summer Play Scheme). We know these families will continue to need specialist support with their recovery through therapeutic support along with other essential items over the summer holidays such as activities and games.     Every donation made during Big Give will be doubled and go directly to Summer Wellbeing Programme to help these families build a life beyond crisis.     Blerta’s story (as told by Alex her advocate)    Blerta* is a survivor of modern slavery and has two young children. She relies on emergency food parcels from Hestia and foodbanks to support her family.     Blerta and her family live in shared accommodation with other asylum seekers. This has been increasingly difficult as one of her daughters struggles with health issues meaning they have been unable to leave the house. The family are feeling really isolated and low as they need to stay in their room. Blerta will wait for the other residents to leave the kitchen before she deep cleans and then prepares food for her family so she is not having any social contact with anyone else.    Berta’s favourite reflection from last summer is the trip to the zoo she was able to go on with her daughters through Hestia’s summer programme  it was the highlight of their summer. Her children were able to return to school in September with a story of their summer to share with the class. The summer programme not only funded the trip to the zoo but also enabled each family to take a keepsake family photo of the day home with them which Blerta explained to her case worker it was the first family photo they had ever had and she was so thankful for Hestia arranging this trip.",True
