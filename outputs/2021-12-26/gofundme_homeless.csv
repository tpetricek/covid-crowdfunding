Just in the last few months we have rehoused 7 people who have come on to the bus and now rehoused in local hostels with one who now has his own room in a shared property and back working full time.     We also run a community food bank which is a vital service for those who need emergency food parcels.     We have proven the bus to work but with winter here our furniture sales have slowed down and we really need some funding in to least cover us for the next few months so we can keep the bus running.     I have put our costs below  all money is spent on keeping our services running.     Unit & storage rent: £500 this is where our bus is parked and also our storage container.   Telephone & internet system: £20 per month. This is for our landline number for people to get in touch with us.  Petrol: £100 a month to help with volunteers cars.   Waste collection: £20 a month   Portaloo: £25 a week plus vat - we need to get one down yard so we have two toilets on site.   Insurance: £110 a month.   Other costs: around £300 monthly this could be things like topping up first aid box  topping up equipment on the bus or carrying out dbs checks.   These are our main costs we need to cover every month just to run if you could please make a donation and share.   You can see what we do on our Facebook page Norwich Homeless Support.       ",False

The sad reality is that many heroic veterans have gone through so much  such as losing their friends on the frontline or witnessing a truly tragic event unfold in front of their eyes. No one wants to go through suffering as a result of such adverse events. After all  these heroes fight for the many freedoms that we enjoy day to day. Which is why it is important that they get the best treatment after coming home from war struck countries such as the likes of Afghanistan and Iraq. As a close friend of a mate who will be joining the army soon to go and serve  I want to do my bit to help and ensure our relentless heroes get the post-war treatment/rehabilitation that they deserve.
