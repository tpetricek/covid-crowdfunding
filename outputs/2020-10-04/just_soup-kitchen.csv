Firstly, let me say thank you for the outpouring of support we've received. It's always a heart-warming feeling to know that we have so many incredible supporters. 

Last week, in light of the Coronavirus, we made the difficult decision to offer a takeaway-only food service to guests rather than their usual sit-down meal. As most of you know, we take a huge amount of pride in the fact that we offer not just a warm meal to our guests, but also a safe and warm space off the streets for them for the hours they're with us. As we considered the health risks we decided that it would be prudent to only offer a takeaway food service for the foreseeable future.

This is just a small part of my project and I'm partially hoping that it will work as a form of non-traditional&nbsp;public art. Whilst brainstorming ideas for this project, I focused on Peterborough because I have lived here most of my life meaning I have a personal attachment to this specific Urban Environment. A big issue in most urban environments is homelessness because of the overpopulation of the area, meaning it is difficult to earn money and afford a roof over your head, let alone food to eat. This is a huge problem in Peterborough so I'm using this project to start a campaign and raise awareness. </p><p>I have started this fundraising page mainly to raise awareness about Peterborough Soup Kitchen. Upon researching them recently, I have found out that they provide food and drinks for 35 - 76 people A DAY. The charity deserves the donations and if you live in or have visited Peterborough, you will know just how many unfortunate, homeless people there are on the streets.
