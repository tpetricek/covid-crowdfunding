This could be Social Workers, Health Visitors, GP’s, Schools, Citizen Advice Bureau and many of the voluntary organisations working in the area.

We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks, supported by The Trussell Trust, working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK. Last year we helped 1209 different households locally, providing 5218 3-day emergency food supplies in crisis. This is an increase of 11% on the previous year.

"Welfare support to ex RAF Cranwell Apprentices","Unit 12 New Lairdship Yards,Broomhouse Road  Edinburgh,Midlothian  EH11 3UY","Edinburgh Food Project","Edinburgh Food Project (EFP) are a local independant charity (SC043220) and are a member of, but are not funded by, the Trussell Trust network. EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by one full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.   EFP operates 7 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme. Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances. Each food pack provides at least three meals for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave). In 2018-19, we provided 11,495 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 19.6% increase on the previous year. We were able to do so by receiving 130,000kg of food from public donations. Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps. Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres.  Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.

In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year. That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK. If you'd like more information or have any questions about fundraising please don't hesitate to contact us. We'd be delighted to hear from you. ",False,2020-08-21,"2020-09-20 10/2020-09-19 20/2020-09-17 25/2020-09-17 30/2020-09-16 10/2020-09-15 20/2020-09-14 20/2020-09-14 25/2020-09-14 50/2020-09-11 15/2020-09-10 30/2020-09-09 10/2020-09-09 15/2020-09-08 20/2020-09-08 30/2020-09-07 10/2020-09-07 10/2020-09-07 15/2020-09-06 20/2020-09-06 25/2020-09-04 30/2020-09-03 30/2020-09-03 20/2020-08-25 15/2020-08-25 10/2020-08-24 60/2020-08-24 150/2020-08-23 20/2020-08-23 20/2020-08-22 30/2020-08-22 20/2020-08-22 20/2020-08-21 15/2020-08-21 50",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=SarahThacker4&pageUrl=1,2020-09-20,,,1010
