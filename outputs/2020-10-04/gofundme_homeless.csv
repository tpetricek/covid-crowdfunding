"Protective Equipment (PPE) for Lebanon Frontliners","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/protective-equipment-for-lebanon,4444,-1,,2020-08-11,,,0,,"On August 4 2020  a massive explosion rocked Lebanon's capital city  Beirut  to its core. At least 220 people have lost their lives  7000 are injured  300 000 are homeless  and hundreds are still missing. This explosion is only the latest disaster wrought on the Lebanese people by its corrupt and careless government. But the Lebanese are fighting back  as they have done since the start of the October 2019 revolution: they are fighting to end the rule of oligarchs  they are fighting for equality  they are fighting to rebuild their city and their country  and they need your help.     We are raising funds to enable the purchase and supply protective equipment to volunteers and protestors alike on the ground in Beirut. In the direct aftermath of the blast  Lebanese citizens mobilised and took to cleaning the city themselves  without any centralised state support. A city-wide initiative such as this requires adequate PPE (in some areas like Gemmayze and Mar Mkhael  the hardest hit in the city  rubble from demolished buildings still falls on the streets).     At the same time  these volunteers and activists are often the target of police brutality. The Lebanese government has today announced a state of emergency  giving the army sweeping powers to impose curfews  disperse crowds  and much more. Civilians are now at heightened risk  becoming increasingly targeted by army and police forces alike. Not only have the police and army not lifted a finger to aid in the cleaning  rescue and relief initiatives  they are also actively impeding the efforts of the Lebanese citizens who are doing this work. From intimidation tactics to outright aggression (countless journalists have documented the use of force by the army and police against activists)  excessive violence against Lebanese citizens doesn't seem to stop. It is our duty to enable them to protect themselves  as they protect the nation's future.     -----    All raised funds will be transferred to NGOs on the ground who will purchase helmets  protective gloves  face masks  goggles and shields and make them available to the activists on the ground.    The estimate costs are:     $10 Helmet   $10 Goggles & Gloves Combined  $25 Face Mask  $25 Shields     At a cost of $70 per person per full gear  we estimate to be able to support approximately 277 frontliners.",False

Im not quite sure what else to say here except that if you know him you know what this is in aid of and i hope you will help to keep that light from his soul to glow on us all one more night in these dark days. With the funds raised I plan to try and get public space for the statue and also to pay for any costs incurred for Bobs remembrance service  also I want to build a memorial garden. I also have two long term goals which I am now going to pursue in his honour which are to Start a trust or Foundation for those who have no voice  wether human or animal I want to be able to pay forward and help however I can. my other project will be about making a documentary series where each episode I will travel to a different city and sleep rough with the local homeless and explore how different societies view homelessness and how their respective governments try to deal with it in an effort to educate myself and the viewer about the realities of being out there in the world with no roof or hope. Bob has inspired me and I know many of you  so I feel this will be something you can all get behind and help to make real  I want to finally point out that I do not plan to use any of this money for myself except to cover the expenses of the projects and memorial funds  I have no need of it personally but I wanted the public to feel they are a part of Bobs legacy!! We hit £100.000 - This has blown me away  thank you all so much for your support  everything that comes in from now will be put towards the Trust on top of the funds left after we calculate the cost of his memorial and the documentary!! Also if you want to keep up to date with what I am doing then you can follow Bandit & Gizmo (Brothers of Bob) on Instagram & Facebook. I will be having a memorial service in June 2021 for the 1st anniversary of Bobs passing and will keep everyone posted for the details so you can all attend if you can!! Thank you James Bowen",False

As if that wasn’t bad enough  he is now in danger of having his boat confiscated by the canal and river trust  over the non-payment of licence fees.     Let’s not dwell on why these fees weren’t paid  but the fact that this young man  who has recently lost an eye and his job as a result  is about to loose his home too. I can’t even begin to imagine what he is going through right now  but he definitely does not deserve to be homeless too. Join us in helping to raise the funds to prevent this from happening  and to help Kane keep his home. In these difficult times we’re all facing  we need to be there for each other and to help out as much as we possibly can.    Any money raised through this will go towards paying the license fees  and any additional funds will go towards potentially obtaining a permanent mooring  to make this difficult time slightly easier for him as he is struggling to adjust to sailing his boat with only one eye.

"King of Merch in crisis","Brentwood, East of England, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/king-of-merch-in-crisis,500,943,,2020-10-03,,,0,,"I've got a friend. His name is Chris Brown  but around the London music scene everyone knows him as the King of Merch. For years  maybe decades  Chris has been helping bands and artists in London and all over the country by running their merch stands  taking no payment or profit for himself. Chris does this because he loves live music  especially punk and folk punk and because he is a selfless human being who just loves the scene. If you have been to small punk gig in London and bought merch  chances are Chris sold it to you. Everywhere I go everyone knows Chris.    Now Chris is having a crisis. For personal reasons Chris is having to move out of his home  but with limited funds his ability to find alternative accommodation is very restricted to non-existent. Almost as soon as this happened he then received some catastrophic personal news that has left him on his knees. If you know Chris you know the story  but if you don't then suffice to say he has suddenly found himself about to be homeless  with nothing but ten quid in the bank  no homely possessions and nowhere to go.    I know that everyone that knows Chris would buy him a pint. If all the bands he has worked with  all the fans that know him and all the people he has helped over the years gave £5 (London pint prices!) then we'd help a brother in dire need. Help him to get a roof over his head and the basic necessities of life like a kettle  cutlery  plates and cups  a chair or sofa to sit on  while he rebuilds his life.    Chris needs our help right now. I know it's a difficult time for everyone  especially in the music scene. Chris has helped 100s of people  now it's time he got a little of that help back from us.",False

"Covid19 Emergency Relief for Homeless in London","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/underonesky-homelessaid2020,175000,178893,,2019-11-09,,,0,,"On 2 April we launched an emergency initiative after meeting homeless people who hadn't eaten for days due to the Covid19 lock down. For 120 days our team served up to 500 homeless daily with food  hot drinks  mobile phones  socks  underwear and conversations. By 1 August we had served our homeless friends 37 172 times.    Our commitment on 2 April was to serve daily until the end of the lock down when regular homeless support facilities would reopen. We delivered on this commitment.    Our street support activities continue and any donation will support those. We have operated since 2012.    Under One Sky is a collective of private individuals. Nobody is employed by Under One Sky. Our work is 100% volunteer based.    There was a need to move so quickly we didn't have the resource to launch a new fund raising campaign for our Covid19 emergency initiative. Instead we decided to use our winter fund raising page. The text below is from that campaign.    ---------------------------    Since 2012 Under One Sky has supported more than 3000 people living on the streets of London. Over the coming winter months  we hope to reach another 1000 homeless during our night walks.     Our work is inspiring others to join the Under One Sky family with events being planned in Cambridge (UK)  Madrid  and Boston (US).    In the last 12 months 9000 slept rough in London - an increase of 18%. Deaths among homeless in England and Wales increased by 22% to 726 in the same period.    Under One Sky is a 100% volunteer run collective of 450 passionate people with full-time jobs and families. At our most recent events  more than 10% of volunteers were children and teenagers. Our founding principle is that humanity is ONE family regardless of nationality  race  religion  class or any other label.    On cold winter nights we meet the homeless in a spirit of compassion and with a genuine desire to connect. To make them feel they belong in this world just as much as anyone else. Letting them know they have not been forgotten.    We distribute life support packages: food  clothing  toiletries  sleeping bags  gift cards  books  and messages of hope and light for those living in some dark times in their lives. The gift cards can be used to buy tents  winter clothing  or other necessities – they are a life saver. Our mantra: “For a better tomorrow  you must survive today”.    We are completely reliant on private funds  and every penny we raise goes directly to the homeless people we serve. Your donation will be used to buy gift cards and supplies.    You Will Make A Difference    We can’t wait to bring your donation to those who are fighting every day to simply stay alive. Our first winter event this year will take place on the night of Saturday 14th December where we will support at least 250 homeless people.    If you are not able to donate  then we would love for you to share our campaign using the “Share” button (below the “Donate Now” button) or using this link: www.gofundme.com/f/underonesky-homelessaid2020    It is also possible to support by donating sleeping bags using our Amazon Wish list    Finally  you are welcome to send us a message for us to share with the homeless – simply contact us on this page.

By telling their stories we hope to raise awareness to the realities about what being homeless truly means. We aim to educate and inspire more people to reach out and take action.    In early 2020 we will launch our first Very Important Homeless Person (VIHP) event. An afternoon of food and entertainment (music  talks  comedy) exclusively for the homeless – a moment to feel “normal”. We have support from a major music company who will help source artists  and a UK comedy streaming platform.    The real impact your support can have….    Last year  our Embankment team met Robert  who to their surprise was working for UberEats despite sleeping on the streets. He used our £30 gift card to buy a mobile charger for his bicycle so he would no longer lose out on income when charging his phone. The team were so impressed with Robert that we looked for other ways to support him. One afternoon we told his story on Facebook with a call out for job opportunities and housing. In a few hours he had four job interviews and two people offering him free temporary housing. Robert moved in the next day and had a job a week later. We also sponsored him so he could visit his mother who was diagnosed with cancer.    Two years ago  our Oxford Street team met a young homeless man named Singh and changed his life immediately. With their encouragement and a £30 gift card he bought a mobile phone and contacted his family. Our team were also able to arrange a job interview. Within six days Singh had a flat and a job. One year later he joined the same Oxford Street team that had helped him  to support other homeless people. Since then  Singh has been promoted twice at work  and is now saving up to buy a property.    We have heard many heart-breaking street stories over the years but often told by people with immense life spark. We have brought many smiles  hugs  and lifesaving supplies to those same people and we hope to bring many more this winter with your help.    Supporters    ",False

We’ve all seen people sleeping rough near where we live and work. Rough sleeping has more than doubled in London since 2010. During the past year alone  almost 9 000 people were seen sleeping out on London’s streets.    Welfare changes  soaring housing costs  and a shortage of affordable accommodation mean that more and more people are left with nowhere they can call home. The London Homeless Collective (29 charities with decades of experience in tackling homelessness) are working with the Mayor of London and local councils to provide services to help people rough sleeping to leave the streets.     Every Londoner can help too. You can donate to the London Homeless Collective so that we can offer more support to help people leave the streets and rebuild their lives.    Each member of this group has a specific project – such as providing emergency accommodation  longer-term support  or providing advice and assistance - that will benefit from your support. By giving your money to this coalition of charities  you can be confident that your donation will be distributed fairly and provide real help for people sleeping rough.     The Mayor of London  Sadiq Khan said: “The number of people sleeping rough on our streets is a national disgrace  and since becoming Mayor I have made it a priority to do everything in my power to tackle this crisis.    “The generosity of Londoners is well known  especially at this time of year  so I implore everyone to give what they can to help some of the most vulnerable people in our society.    “Every year we help record numbers through my winter programme - and while this is a testament to the hard work of outreach workers and shelter staff  it is also a damning indictment of the Government’s failure to get to grips with this vitally important issue.”     If you would like to find out more about the projects that will be funded email [email redacted].uk    The London Homeless Collective comprises:    The 999 Club and Lady Florence Trust  The Albert Kennedy Trust  Barons Court Project  Caritas - Anchor House  Centrepoint Soho  The Church Army  The Connection at St Martins-in the-Fields  Crisis UK  Depaul UK  Evolve Housing + Support  Glass Door Homeless Charity  Homeless Action in Barnet  Homeless Link  Housing Justice  Kingston Churches Action on Homelessness  LookAhead  New Horizon Youth Centre  Providence Row  The Salvation Army  Shelter  the National Campaign for Homeless People Limited  The Single Homeless Project  Spear Housing Association Limited  St Mungo Community Housing Association  Thames Reach Charity  The Big Issue Foundation  Passage 2000  West London Mission Methodist Circuit  National Council of Young Men's Christian Associations  Veteran's Aid.

As a result this is putting a huge strain on our already meagre resources and that we are desperate for more funds so that we can meet the veterinary costs of all the cats in need who come into our care.     One of our recent cases is Sammy    The handsome and loveable Sammy  a 3-year-old semi longhaired black cat  came into Feline Friends’ care after his owner developed mental health problems and threw him out on the streets. A neighbour took pity on the young cat and took him but her own cats made poor Sammy feel unwelcome and refused to let him stay so Sammy was homeless again. She called Feline Friends who took him on and he is now in the care of one of our long-time fosterers who said Sammy is “the sweetest cat she ever cared for”. Sammy has thrived in her care. He is playful and trusting and loves the company of humans.     A week or so ago Sammy’s back legs  which always had a slightly bowed appearance  suddenly started to give way  especially when he tried to walk up or down the stairs.    Sammy was rushed to a vet who gave him painkillers. He then had an X-ray at Celia Hammond Animal Trust  which confirmed ‘bilateral patella luxation’ or dislocated knee caps  which will require two operations to get the bilateral femoral head excisions corrected. We are very grateful that an experienced orthopedic vet at Celia Hammond Animal Trust is able to do the operation for a non-commercial fee of 1530 pounds.     Without this surgery  Sammy will remain in severe discomfort and suffer the frustration of periods of not being able to walk properly. The prognosis for young cats like Sammy is quite good. And the playful Sammy could see the fun side of life again and enjoy the freedom of movement he enjoyed until recently.     Sammy is one of several of our foster cats needing surgery or complex treatment to ensure quality of life and  in some cases  to save their life.      Please donate to us to help Sammy and our other rescue cats in need of treatment. Every penny donated to us goes on the care of our cats since Feline Friends is entirely run by volunteers. We are a ‘no-kill’ cat charity and are committed to ensuring each cat in our care receives whatever treatment he or she needs to ensure their quality of life.      THANK YOU!",False

"Keep All-Women Shortlists Female!","Liverpool, North West England, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/fighting-for-female-representatives,40000,32030,,2018-01-12,,,0,,"Comrades  we are a group of Labour women who want to ensure all-women shortlists (AWS) remain reserved for females and that women's representation in the party increases. We believe that the election of self-identifying transwomen as women's officers and their inclusion on all-women shortlists is reducing and undermining female representation in the Labour party.    We are absolutely committed to trans people  as a marginalised group  living free from discrimination and violence: we need trans representatives  trans councillors and trans MPs in our party. We are socialists and we are egalitarians. However  trans representation must not happen at the expense of female candidates and we are furious that we are having to fight another battle for women's representation  just 100 years after the suffragette victories.    We have been advised that a legal challenge to the Labour party on this could be winnable. The party has recently allowed males to be elected as women's officers and males to be selected over females in all-woman MP candidate selections. This has happened because Labour  in practice  has started to define 'women' by sex AND by self-identification. Labour is now relying on these two antithetical definitions of 'woman' to choose candidates which is the cause of this conflict of interests. We need a resolution.    Self-identification does not define men as women  in law or in fact. Labour conference has neither agreed nor even debated self-id or rule changes to the Labour party's AWS selection process. Women  as a marginalised group  are entitled to AWS under Equality Act 2010 exemptions. Trans people who have had gender reassigment are also  rightly  protected as a group under the act but men who simply self-id as women are not. Only party members can change party rules  not its MPs  not its general secretary and not its paid bureaucrats.    As socialists we understand class analysis and we know the most meaningful way to classify women is by sex. Women are classified as second class citizens because of our biology. None of us can keep our sex a secret and if we could there would be no pay gap and no #MeToo. Whereas no one can tell what another person's gender identity is (if they even have one) just by looking at them. Sex  along with poverty  age  disability and race  is one of the major oppressive hierarchies in the world today. Women's biology has always the basis for our oppression worldwide BY MEN. Feminism is defined as the movement to liberate all women from sex-based oppression.     Self-id also impacts on lesbians and gay men who  by definition  are not homogenderists but homosexuals. Lesbians and gays are currently afforded legal  sex-based protections from discrimination and these are already being diluted by self-id. We believe gender is a manmade  toxic set of stereotypes  used to restrict men and women and we want to see it abolished  not codified into law. We support all gender non-conforming people: be they lesbian  gay or trans. Feminists have always been the vanguard of the fight for people to live their lives in a gender non-conforming way and will continue to do so - but never at the expense of women's rights and representation.    We do not classify people based on a set of gendered ideals by which most will fail: the superficial markers of clothing  hairstyles and make-up... or by body type  weight  or perceived femininity or masculinity. We do not assess people's worth by the way they look or speak - women and men succeed as women and men simply by being. The same is true for girls and boys. All girls are acceptable as girls and all boys are acceptable as boys  however they dress  look or behave. We condemn the medicalisation of pre-pubescent kids who are encouraged to take puberty blockers if they play with the 'wrong' toys or want to wear the 'wrong' clothes. Conservatives see a boy in a dress and want to change the outfit  liberals see the dress as fine but want to change the kid's body. Socialist feminists want kids to be kids and wear what tf they want.    Every penny of the money we raise will go entirely on our legal funds  we will produce all our bank statements  legal bills and legal updates and upload to this site. We want our donors to make the decisions on how to move forward and we will crowdfund direction as well as money. We will follow where you lead  and will keep in regular contact by email  so we can democratically decide how we do this  what we want to achieve  how we go about it and who we employ to act on our behalf.    Your support will mean a great deal to women  it will mean there are people who care  who have not forgotten them. It will mean they are not politically homeless: we stand with them.     Please do not give more than you can really afford  it's not necessary... and don't feel you have to donate - your support and your help in sharing the crowdfunder is enough and IS appreciated.

We all know that only the Labour party has the best interests of women at heart. Please help us to overturn the decisions of the party liberals  weather vanes and bureaucrats to prove this is the case.

As many of you will be aware  after experiencing homelessness myself on a few occasions  I have worked in the sector for over ten years now.     In a variety of posts  and with a few different organisations  I have witnessed first hand how difficult it is to offer the best support to the people we work with  with a limited amount of funds.     Traditionally  the social care sector is always the hardest hit when it comes to cuts by local authorities or local government  and very often the people who need our support the most  suffer more through no fault of their own.     On September 28th 2020  I plan to walk the West Highland Way - all 96 miles of it - to raise some much needed funds for some of the most vulnerable people in the country. I plan to dedicate the funds to two main charities in Scotland  two charities who are very close to my heart from a personal and professional perspective...    Simon Community Scotland and the Glasgow Night Shelter.    On the last day  after reaching Fort William  I will also climb Ben Nevis just to complete the task.

A year after I took this photograph Stephen was dead aged only 39 having fallen ill on the streets in London.    From Outsiders  Manchester  “I grew up in children’s homes  I had abusive parents and I was abused as a child. From the age of 11  I was in and out of institutions and care homes all different ones in Stockport and in secure units. From the age of 13 I began sleeping on the streets  sleeping in the bin sheds on the Offerton Estate. I was running away from the care system. I coped by taking substances  first alcohol then cannabis  then whizz and heroin to numb the pain away”  Michelle  Outsiders Participant  audio testimony Manchester  2019    You can make a difference    Across the UK there are around 320 000 people caught up in some form of homelessness  living hand to mouth on the street or in terrible quality accommodation not fit for human habitation.    When caught up in the frantic business of our day-to-day lives it is easy to pass by and forget that these are all people just like us  someone's son or daughter who has ended up falling on hard times. It could be any of us.    This project has been developed in partnership with the charity Shelter and other partners include The Big Issue  Inspiring Change Manchester and the charity Back on Track. The main themes for the project were developed following a series of discussions with people who have lived experience of homelessness. The charity partners will receive all of the creative outputs of the project royalty-free and will be able to use them for fundraising and raising awareness. A permanent archive of the photographs and audio testimony will be created to act as a legacy for the project for future researchers  and the objective is to develop a touring exhibition and a book to raise awareness across the UK of the multifaceted nature of the problem.    This project is called Outsiders - A Journey Through Homelessness  and through photography and audio testimony it aims to shine a light on the issues facing homeless people from their perspective. The project will amplify their voices while respecting their dignity and giving them control over how they are portrayed.    Following a series of discussion groups in 2019 which were made up of people with lived experience of homeless five main themes were developed for the project which are: entrenched rough sleepers  people in substandard housing  women's support groups  people in transition from homelessness to a stable home environment and homeless people who have been empowered through the creative arts.    The reason why I am crowdfunding for the project is that I did not want any of the charities to divert funds away from their front-line services to pay for the project. An initial bid was made to Arts Council England for funding which was unsuccessful so this crowdfund is now the main source of funds. As such it is a wholly community-driven project.    I am a freelancer and am giving my time to this project entirely free of charge and am taking nothing personally from the project funds. All donations will go to cover expenses which are necessarily incurred in doing the project including travel costs  accommodation  equipment  processing  printing and other costs linked to the project. Any money that is left over when Outsiders is complete will be donated to Shelter. It is a two year project and the overall costs were estimated to be £30 000 had the ACE bid been successful. It has now been scaled back based on the resources available but remains a major national project.     The project is entirely community-financed so I need your help to make this a reality. Your donation will make a very real difference to the lives of these people and will challenge decision-makers by showing them the stark reality of the way so many people are forced to live in one of the richest economies in the world.    The introductions and photo shoots for the project are being organised by the partner charities  mostly by Shelter in the early phase of the project  and members of Shelter's operational teams are present at all photo shoots with their service users. Overview from a safeguarding perspective comes from the case studies manager at Shelter to ensure the welfare of service users is central to the project.    All of the people who take part in the project are considered to be participants rather than subjects  with an input into the creative process and the ability to withdraw their consent at any time. Respect and dignity for those who choose to share their stories is paramount.    Homeless people I have spoken to often say that it is being ignored and treated as something less than human which hurts the most. This project aims to encourage people to interact with those who are homeless and recognise that they are people just like you and me  and they all have a story.    Photo shoots have now taken place in Manchester and London covering street homelessness and people living in substandard housing. It is planned to extend this to cover the North East of England  Birmingham  Glasgow and (if funds allow) Belfast. The project was put on hold in March due to Covid-19 but will be restarting later this year with outdoor photography only  done using social distancing.    In 1968 Nick Hedges was commissioned by Shelter to produce an enduring record of bad housing conditions at the time. He was shocked to the core by what he found. This new project will seek to highlight what  if anything  has changed.     From what I have photographed so far in the project many people are still living hand-to-mouth in appalling housing conditions. Jackie who I photographed in London in February this year was living in a flat with broken windows and which was riddled with damp. There was no heating and she told me that she has to make a choice between food or heating and had been unable to turn the heating on in her flat all winter as she could not afford it. She had contemplated suicide the previous month. Nobody should have to live like this in a prosperous country like ours.    You can find examples of my photography here https://davenantphotos.wordpress.com/portfolio-2/    What it means in practice   This is a not-for-profit project with the sole aim of benefiting members of the homeless community and amplifying the voices of those who are all too often ignored by society.    Your donation will make an enormous difference to the project which involves a lot of costs travelling to and engaging with homeless people in different locations across the UK and building long-term relations with them.    Anyone who makes a donation of £100 or more will be entitled to a limited edition signed print from the Outsiders series and will also be named as a donor on the website.    Whatever you can afford to donate I will be eternally grateful.    Please note Sarah Aston is shown as a beneficiary by the system as she is acting as my agent and will be drawing down the money for me. All donations will go to the project.",False
"UK mum has 94k legal debt after unjust sharia case","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/help-afsana-fight-unjust-uk-sharia-court-ruling,94000,28251,,2020-08-16,,,0,,"My name is Afsana. I’m a British woman whose beloved son was taken away in Dubai.     In 2012 my French Catholic husband used Dubai’s sharia court system to divorce me. The court took my beautiful boy Louis away and I've spent the last 8 years fighting legal battles in 3 countries to be reunited with him.    The sharia divorce stated that I had ‘refused to obey my husband’ and I was a negligent mother because Louis had eczema.     I took my case to the British courts looking for justice  but a High Court judge accepted the sharia divorce granted by a ‘friendly nation.’    In France  the Supreme Court ruled exactly the opposite and threw out the ‘manifestly discriminatory’ Dubai decision. The UN has also condemned the way Dubai courts treat women.     But  in a highly unusual move  the judge in London ordered me to pay my ex-husband’s legal costs. I’m now facing a bill of £93 867.96 and the threat of losing my home.     If you think it’s unacceptable in modern Britain that I should be made bankrupt - because I fought to have a relationship with my young son  and because I fought against Dubai’s sharia system - please give any help you can.     I have only a couple of months to raise the money I need.     Thank you.     #HelpAfsana    ++++++++    I’m just a normal person trapped in horrible circumstances. And my faith in British justice has been badly shaken.    I came back to this country with nothing except the hope of a fair hearing.     But the British judge googled Dubai’s sharia legal system and concluded it was similar to our own divorce laws.     I had reported domestic abuse to the Dubai authorities and provided the British court with evidence of abuse and coercive control. But the judge said I didn’t look or behave like a victim.    He took no account of the fact that I lost my son when he was just three years old. The only thing I gained from the British court case was six hours a year to be with Louis  in a tiny room in London under strict supervision.     The judge accepted that I had been thrown out of the marital home in Dubai. My husband cut off all financial support and until my son was taken away we were homeless and living off charitable handouts.    The judge also accepted that I had PTSD as a result of what happened to me in Dubai. Back in London  I had no job or income.    But he still said I had to pay costs.     If I don't pay  I am threatened with bankruptcy and the loss of my family home. After everything I have endured  this is too cruel. But I will never stop fighting for Louis.     Earlier this year the High Court in London ruled against Dubai's billionaire ruler  Sheikh Mohammed  suggesting his former wife Princess Haya could never get a fair hearing in Dubai's sharia system.     If it’s not fair for a princess  how can it possibly be fair for me? And how can British and French courts come to such different conclusions about my case?     Please take a few minutes to read my story. It explains why the costs order is unjust and why I need your help.      It also raises fundamental questions about British justice.    ABOUT ME    I'm Afsana Lachaux  and I'm a Londoner. I'm a mother  a social policy expert and an activist for women’s rights. In 2019 I won the Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize for my work in campaigning for justice and protection of women.    After I lobbied extensively  the Foreign and Commonwealth Office changed its travel advice  to warn British women that they could face sharia court custody proceedings in the United Arab Emirates.     It was something that never occurred to me when I first moved to Dubai.         WHY AM I CROWDFUNDING?    It’s extremely rare  in cases involving children  to end up paying the other side’s costs.    The judge was given evidence of my inability to pay this exorbitant amount. He was told of the hardship it would cause me financially and mentally.     The only asset I had was my home. When the judge made his decision  I was also caring for my elderly mother.     The court accepted the evidence given by a medical expert that I had been traumatised by being separated from my young son  and by my unjust treatment in Dubai.     The judge found that my husband had kicked me out of the house with a one-year-old baby and had refused to support us financially. Yet  despite all this evidence  the judge decided I should pay my ex husband’s legal costs.    I am trying to rebuild my life. After a decade of being unable to work  I am just getting back to normal. I now work for a charity and campaign on equal access to the law.     Please help me fight this unfair decision and protect vulnerable people from the unaffordable price of real justice.      WHAT WILL I DO WITH THIS MONEY?    1. It will help me pay the legal costs.     2. It will help me keep a home for Louis  so he can get to know his family when he is old enough to make his own decisions.      3. The support generated by this crowdfunder will help my campaign to change the law  to prevent cost orders being made against vulnerable people.     It shouldn't be one rule for the rich  and another for the poor.     WHY DOES THIS MATTER?    This is about whether the British legal system is protecting its own citizens.     Why is it supporting sharia law?    It's morally wrong.     The award of costs can also have a crippling effect financially and emotionally  especially on victims of domestic abuse.     The judge didn't have to make me pay this extortionate amount.     His decision has caused my mental health to deteriorate and placed enormous hardship on me.     Please share with friends  family and well wishers. You can also follow me on twitter @afsanalachaux or visit my website afsanalachaux.com to learn more about this crowd-funding campaign.     I would be grateful for any contribution you can make. Thank you.    Afsana     +++++++++    MY STORY IN MORE DETAIL     In April 2011  my marriage had collapsed. I found myself homeless in Dubai  with a young baby to look after. My husband suddenly changed the locks on the home we had shared.     A few months earlier  I had filed a complaint of domestic violence with the Dubai police. But it was dismissed at a time when Human Rights Watch said Dubai was failing to respond adequately to prevent abuse. You can read more about that here.     I was alone with Louis  cut off from family and friends. And without any financial support from my husband.    While I was struggling to survive in a foreign land  my husband used Dubai’s sharia courts to divorce me.     The judgment stated I was an unfit mother because Louis had eczema  I had gay friends and I had refused to ‘obey my husband’. The court was provided pictures of our pre-wedding party to prove that I ‘frequented night clubs.’     You can read this BBC report about my case https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28638553.     Louis was only three years old when he was taken from me. I was grief stricken and stuck in Dubai without any rights. I eventually got on a plane with just a handbag  and Louis’s Pooh Bear  and came back to the safety of my family in the UK. I put my faith in British justice and hoped for a fair hearing in London.     It was not to be. Instead  the High court endorsed the Dubai divorce and supported the Sharia legal system – the judge said he was “satisfied that the divorce …is entirely consistent with our public policy as it is virtually the same as the ground for divorce that is principally used here.”     This was a huge shock to me because British law doesn’t have a ground for divorce based on disobedience to the husband.     It was only the French legal system that stood up for my rights. In the home country of my former husband  the Supreme Court found the Dubai divorce ruling to be “manifestly discriminatory.”     Other British courts have raised serious questions about the nature of justice in Dubai. Just this year  another British judge found the ruler of Dubai (who is also the head of the Dubai court system) guilty of the kidnap and tortureof his own daughters.       His wife and children fled to Britain seeking the protection of the British courts in fear of their lives.    But the judge in my case was willing to accept that the sharia system in Dubai provided a woman like me with a fair hearing.    In a British court room  I was accused of being ‘intelligent’  and ‘articulate’  and the judge decided that undermined my credibility as a genuine victim of abuse. I felt constantly ridiculed.     Hearing a British judge say that I didn’t look like someone “under the coercive control of the husband” was extremely distressing.     My case was argued extensively in France  all the way up to the Supreme Court. They were provided with the same information as the British Courts. At no point did the French judges indulge in any victim blaming.    Dubai's sharia laws have been roundly condemned by both the UN and by European courts  for unfair trials and discriminatory treatment towards women. But that didn't seem to matter in a court room in London - and now I face financial ruin because I'm (still) fighting for justice.    Whatever happens  I will never stop fighting for Louis. I know that there are lots of people out there who feel like I do  and who believe in the principle of a fair and just British system.

I don't have enough resources to open a shelter  so the second best thing I could think of  was preventing future generations of homeless animals.     I'm raising money so that I can continue spaying them on a bigger scale. I want to spay at least 15 dogs living outside of the local hospital. They are mostly males and they're aggressive towards pedestrians and bike riders. Once desexed  their aggression levels will significantly drop.   I'll get them with the help of a hired dog catcher  who will travel 12 hours to get here  as there aren't any darters in this area.

I always get paid for September at the   end of October. With no work in September  there is no pay in October. Works I do in October will pay at the end of November. It’s only mid September and I can’tsurvive until the end of November.  In October I will have to start taking my daughter to child minder  and I have to payahead. I just can’t hold out that long. And I have a lot of debt also since lockdown started(from friends and credit card) I am staying at the homeless hostel room so we are ok for accommodation now but universal credit won’t pay me this month because I received self employed grant in August but that’s only £500.  I will be super grateful if you can help.   I also have been visiting food bank and soif you can contribute to nappy and formula cost  that will be great.  best wishes   Andy ",False

As a global epicentre of ayahuasca shamanism and jungle tourism  one of the major impacts of the corona crisis in the region has been the shutdown of the tourism industry  a large part of which is shamanic and ayahuasca related trade. Those affected include local curanderos  retreat centre employees  and the local artisania community encompassing indigenous Shipibo artists and sellers  as well as homeless people who usually survive from donations from visitors and residents. Having lived in this area for over seven years we have become ingrained with the area and its communities. Collectively  many of us both living here and across the global ayahuasca and psychedelic community  have gained so much from this area and its local cultures; now in this time of crisis  we have the opportunity to give something back and help these communities survive beyond the pandemic.       With the money raised through this campaign  through a volunteer effort we will distribute foods and essential goods to indigenous and minority groups including Shipibo communities in the vicinity  local districts where supplies are diminishing such as Genaro Herrera and Cabo Lopez where we previously lived and worked  and the homeless in the city centre who currently have no support services available to them. We have been supporting some people in our area by providing food and water as much as we can. However  recognizing that the need is greater than we can manage ourselves  we are now asking for your support to formalize this effort and increase our impact.       We set out to help 50 families or groups and so far have helped approximately 500! We hope to continue to help these families and groups for the coming months as lock-down measures persist and tourism remains closed down for the foreseeable future. Thank you for your any support you can offer! PLEASE NOTE: DONATIONS CAN BE ACCEPTED IN ANY CURRENCY AND ARE CONVERTED THROUGH THE PLATFORM.

We’ve all seen people sleeping rough near where we live and work. During the past year  almost 8 000 people were seen sleeping out on London’s streets.    Welfare changes  soaring housing costs  and a shortage of affordable accommodation mean that more and more people are left with nowhere they can call home. Rough sleeping has more than doubled in London since 2010.    Homelessness charities are working with the Mayor of London and local councils to provide services to help people rough sleeping to leave the streets.     Every Londoner can help too. You can donate to the London Homeless Charities Group so that we can offer more support to help people leave the streets and rebuild their lives.    22 charities with decades of combined experience in tackling homelessness have come together to provide a single point for donations. By giving your money to this coalition of charities  you can be confident that your donation will be distributed fairly and provide real help for people sleeping rough.     Each of the participating charities has nominated a project that will benefit from your support. All the projects share a commitment to helping people sleeping rough or who are at risk of doing so  whether through providing assistance and advice  emergency accommodation  or the support people need over the long term. Contact us if you want to know more about our work by e-mailing [email redacted] .    The Mayor of London  Sadiq Khan  said:     “Even one person sleeping rough in London is one too many  which is why I’m asking Londoners to join me on my mission to end homelessness.     “Last year Londoners generously donated £200 000 to homelessness charities  and made a record number of referrals through StreetLink  which helps outreach workers find rough sleepers and offer them support. This year  we’ve brought together 22 charities running homelessness projects who Londoners can give money to  both through this single donation page and through new contactless donation points across the capital.     “I urge Londoners to get involved  donate  and join me in doing all we can to help make homelessness a thing of the past.”    Sign up if you would like to receive updates about how the Mayor is helping rough sleepers off the streets .

You could be supporting emergency severe weather shelters for people with nowhere else to turn in sub-zero temperatures  or specialised skills training to help someone experiencing homelessness into work.

The emergency services were informed and admitted Hareem into Queen's Medical Centre. The doctor that reviewed Hareem's medical records had made the assumption that Hareem had acid reflux  as the doctors suggested his health to be perfect for his age - if not better.    Whilst Hareem was admitted he underwent an Endoscopy scan which uncovered a large sized lump in his oesophagus. The doctors had informed Hareem's family this could be cancerous. He was subjected to a CT scan which confirmed the family's worst fear  Hareem had been diagnosed with oesophageal cancer  which has now spread to his gland. This came as a shock to even the doctors as they stated they've never experienced this in their lifetimes and is extremely rare to be diagnosed with oesophagus cancer at the age of 24.     He currently is 24 years of age  this form of cancer is extremely rare in a young adults as ""less than 15% of cases are found by people younger than age 55."" We  Hareem's brothers  are starting this GoFundMe page on his behalf to help fund for his treatment abroad at John Hopkins hospital in America. The specific treatment that we are seeking at John Hopkins hospital is Immunotherapy  which would be the most effective treatment for the cancer that he has.    Hareem had been diagnosed 6 days before his first wedding anniversary. Hareem Ahmed married on 26th of August 2016 and had dreams of having children. However  being diagnosed with cancer 6 days before your 1st wedding anniversary is heart-breaking. As you can imagine  a year prior to the diagnosis – on his wedding day  he was flooded with happiness which was amplified through his heart-warming smiley  even though he has always had that smile on his face. Despite the devistating news he was confronted with  he still smiles and laughs all the time. He's still the same Hareem everyone knows him as; happy  cheerful and kind-hearted.    Because of this  Hareem has now been forced to put his life on hold. During these 24 years of his life  he has been working towards helping others  having a family and owning his very own business. Hareem has dreams and ambitions to pursue a career within the Business Management and Marketing sector  as this was the subject he studied whilst at University. Furthermore  Hareem firmly believes owning a business isn't enough as helping others is his ultimate goal.    As Hareem firmly believes the family  friends and the general public will assist him in this time of need  Hareem wishes to help others through charity work once he is succesful in his battle with cancer. After being diagnosed with cancer  Hareem has stated he wishes to help those that most need it ranging from those with cancer to those that are homeless. Furthermore  he has also stated that once he recovers from this battle against cancer  he wishes to devot his life towards charity work by starting his own charity foundation and volunteering spare time in order to help those that most need it  as well as owning a business to get him by.    Hareem is a very confident and well spoken individual who aspires to achieve the best he possibly can. He has a strong state of mind and has remained strong throughout this difficult time. He is very thankful for all the support he has been receiving and also reads every comment and message. As he is currently recovering  he's unable to respond to everyone but he does want everyone to know he is very thankful and appreciative of all the support.    We ask for your help to raise money for Hareem and the urgent treatment he requires to help get his life back on track.

It was pouring down with rain & bitterly cold & we couldn't just drive away without offering him something to eat.   We offered him some food that we had on us to which he was extremely grateful for.   We talked for a couple minutes & we then left. We were no more than 5 minutes down the road before we had to turn around & go back to him as something told us we had to help.  We sat in the rain & just talked. Learning Cornish's story only added to the heartbreak. A stone mason by trade of 22 years  never not worked a day in his life  a partner & 2 daughters. Until redundency hit & a messy divorce left him with nothing.   He moved back to his home town Plymouth after several years living up the line to be told by the council that as he had moved away he had lost his local connections & therefore had no housing priority.   What has made Cornish stand out from all the other people ive met living on the streets is his unbelievable courteous manner & gratitude for any help he receives. To make matters worse due to him NOT having either a drug or drink problem & being lucky enough to NOT have any mental health problems it means he is even more less of a priority for help.   I firmly believe we meet certain people in our lives for a reason & that night my Mum & I were meant to meet Cornish as he's given us both such a more appreciative look at life & not to take the small thing's for granted.  This incredibly friendly  polite  well mannered gentlman is currently homeless with only a bag of belongings to his name. All he wants is a roof over his head to call his own & a fixed address to be able to apply to get back into work so he can be his own person again & feel like he can integrate back into society.     I have lined up a bedsit for him  to which the landlord has agreed to but we need to raise the finances to secure it for him.   Im desperate to help Cornish start 2019 the way he deserves so any donation you can afford would be so gratefully appreciated by my Mum & I & of course Cornish.     We're looking to raise a total of £750 which would pay for the deposit & rent in advance needed  as well as food shopping to get him through until his job seekers benefit would be activated.

The situation changed for the worst last night  when the police started forcing migrants living on the streets around Kara Tepe and in the hills around the burned camp towards the new closed camp. They did so by blackmailing those on the streets: attempting to intimidate them and threatening to take them to prison or to close their asylum cases if they did not obey.  Today  the police attempted to repress all efforts by self organized groups to distribute food and essential items  restricting access to the area around Kara Tepe.  As an assembly  we refuse to work with any of the NGOs working within closed camp  as they are collaborating with the state and therefore complicit in the violence. The Lesvos Mutual Aid Network was created at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic  and will continue to offer assistance to those in need. However  for now we will not be accepting further donations as our ability to reach the people has become extremely limited. We advice that any supplies already collected be distributed through other structures and assemblies that may be in need of support at the moment. We will continue to provide updates in the next few days as the situation continues to evolve.""  Lesvos Mutual Aid Network      Due to the blocked access by police Lesvos Network for Solidarity & Mutual Aid is unable to access the camp and offer donations to the refugees. In these urgent times we stand in solidarity alert to respond to these changes. For this reason  the funds raised will be donated to the Athens based assembly Solidarity With Migrantswho offer support to imprisoned refugees  in the form of legal costs  supplies and distribution of information through demonstrations.     In their own words (translated from Greek):    ""We demand:    An end to the war against migrants by the Greek government and the EU  and all military operations abroad.  The closure of all concentration camps and 'hot spots'  and their replacement with an open  collective infrastructure    for the homeless and discriminated migrants within the cities.

Its 13 000 inhabitants were left helpless without any shelter. Local authorities are blocking the free movement of the victims  causing many of them to sleep rough in the streets and local cemeteries.     A large number of migrants have refused to enter the new facility  demanding asylum to other EU countries or better living conditions. In an attempt to convince people to move into the new camp  the Migration and Asylum Ministry has said that only those who do so will be able to leave the island  leaving them no choice but to move into the new make-shift location. Doctors Without Borders has described the place   set up on a former shooting range  as worse than Moria.    The Greek government is using the pandemic as a pretext to create closed camps.

"The Winstons Amen Breakbeat Gesture","Thorpe Waterville, East Midlands, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/amenbrother,24000,-1,,2015-02-18,,,0,,"The amen breakbeat  possibly the most famous breakbeat and sample of all time!  Everyone knows it  and everyone knows where it came from  so that story does not need to be told again here.  However  what is little known  is that the The Winstons have never received a single penny for its use in the countless music that contains it.  Richard L Spencer  (Lead vocals and sax player) who wrote the arrangement was totally unaware of its cult status until around 1996. It was during that time that he was recovering from a heart attack when he received a phone call from a record label looking to get hold of the masters.This surprised him  has he had not had any dealings with the music industry since 1971  which was when he left the scene to carry on with his life  education and work. During that time he had not received a single penny of royalties from publishing or airplay. Bare in mind that it sold over 1 million copies on the back of the A side ""Color him father"". That could of been a LOT of money!  While recovering from his operation at home  he decided to research the song more and to try to find out why there was a sudden interest in it.  He quickly realised the scale of what had gone on regarding the sampling of the breakbeat  and never returned the call to the record label.    Unfortunately  by this time the statute of limitations had run out  and he was unable to legally persue anyone for using the beat in their music. In this era  there were no copyright laws in place regarding sampling like today. Obviously with the amount that it had been used  it would of been logistically impossible to chase after everyone that had used it  and would of cost untold amounts of money in legal bills too.    All he could do was sit back  be frustrated  and accept what had happened. He gave some interviews at the time  and got on with his life.    Gregory Coleman  the drummer who actually played the beat  also never received any royalties from the sample  he sadly died a broke and homeless man around 2006.    Fast forward to 2011  and the BBC/1Xtra radio station ran a feature on the cult amen breakbeat.  As part of that  DJ and presenter Kutski tracked down Richard L Spencer and recorded a short interview with him. This can be heard on the BBC 1Xtra website here:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hb618During that interview  Richard reveals his frustrations regarding people sampling his music  and that they got nothing back for it.    He went on to say  he would love for people to ""do the right thing"" and give a little something back for using the beat  and to make it legal.    This is where I came into the story (myself a long term lover of the amen break. I grew up on electro  hiphop  rap  UK breakbeat hardcore  jungle and drum & bass scenes) after hearing the interview that someone had posted in a Facebook jungle music group.  It got me thinking  that no one had actually taken up the challange of trying to fulfill his wishes  so I immediately tasked myself with getting in contact with Richard  which I managed quite quickly. I explained my plan to try to get a donation page up and running  and got his blessings to do so.  All monies raised will be given to him  as the copyright owner of Amen brother.    So here is where all of you come in  if you have ever written or sold any music with the amen break  or even just enjoyed one of the countless hundreds and hundreds of tunes that contain it over various genres and styles of music  please donate towards the good cause of the worldwide music community giving something back to the man behind the legendary breakbeat.    Please be aware  this is in no way a means to try to chase royalties  fees or to pay for sample clearance.  It is nothing more than a gesture of good will and obviously totally voluntary.    Thankyou from myself  and also on behalf of Richard.Update:As the campaign has now become very public  the terms from gofundme say that I have to add some more information to help protect against funding campaigns that are set up as scams  so here is the info required:1. Who you are  I am Martyn Webster  42  A DJ from UK who grew up on music. I started in the mid 80's with electro  hiphop  and rap  this moved on to electronic genres and ultimately the UK breakbeat hardcore scene. At this point in early 1992 I started mixing and buying vinyl.  I played out at many clubs and venues around the area I live  and followed the scene through the famous jungle era and onto drum & bass.   Of course  all of these genres right from the rap tunes of 1986 started to sample and use the amen break. Thus  I became one of the generation who took it under their wing and loved it in all of its mutations.  I hung up my headphones in 2004 and had a break (excuse the pun!) from the DJ scene. Seven years later the yearning to mix again was too much  so I got another pair of Technics and now mix for personal enjoyment at home.  Over the years I have built up a large network of friends and contacts both off and online  along with my youtube channel (www.youtube.com/user/martynwebster) which has a huge following. I set up the channel as a way to share the passion and knowledge of the music scenes I have loved so much. The channel has nearly 4 million views and just under 7 thousand subscribers.2. Where you're from  I am from the UK and have lived here all my life  in and around the Northamptonshire area.    3. Your relationship to the parties you're raising funds for  I am simply a fan and long term lover of the sample that was generated from Richard and The Winstons music (Color me father is also a wonderful tune in its own right  and as a step father myself  I can associate with it)    4. How the funds will be spent (be specific as possible)  As above  all money raised will go to Richard.  Some people have said some should go to the daughter and step-daughter of Gregory Coleman (the drummer).  If we are able to get in contact with them then it is definitely something that could also happen.5. How you intend to get the funds to those in need  Ultimately  the perfect end to this whole campaign would be to have the opportunity to hand deliver a cheque to Richard  and something I would take great pride in doing. With me being in the UK and him in the USA it makes things slightly harder  but not impossible.  If I can scrape together the money for flights it will happen.  Otherwise  I will have to transfer funds via banking.",False

As medically required  his bedroom was on the ground floor which meant that the most important posessions were lost.

Westminster is known globally for amazing student fashion and is one of the top places to be  in order to succeed further in any fashion career.   Anybody who knows me  will tell you just how much I love menswear fashion and textiles and how hard I work for all of my education to be able to launch myself into this field. Accepting this offer was extremely exciting  yet daunting. I knew many more sacrifices were going to be needed and a huge financial chunk would need to come from my pocket too.   Whilst this is such an exciting time  it comes at a price - a very expensive one. I have applied for a Student Loan  which covers the cost of £10 000  which is the maximum. However  my Masters Degree is going to cost me £20 000 as it is a two year course.  I have applied for numerous scholarships  some I have succeeded with  others I have not. I have managed to save a huge lump sum through my own money  which has made a considerable dent towards the sum.   I have funded every project so far on my own  which I have passed and funded my own travel to London everyday too.  I am very much doing this on my own.   However  no matter how many hours I put into my little part time job  it still isn't enough and for this year  I owe the remaining amount. I have until the end of July to make this remaining payment.    I am fully committed to making it far with this degree  which is full time.. working all the hours in the studio  commuting daily to London and putting all my blood sweat and tears into it.  It means sacrificing a lot of time with my little boy as a single mother and prior to Covid-19  putting in as many hours I could with my part-time job.   I do this  without complaint because I love what I do.     I have a First Class Honours Degree in Fashion Textiles  Foundation Diploma in Art & Design at Distinction Level  BTEC Art & Design at Distinction Level and all of my GCSE's. Along the way I have been awarded Student of the Year and have numerous scholarships under my belt. I have had fantastic opportunities to work and intern for amazing designers  teach the homeless with my creativity skills and have gained valuable experience throughout the industry through collaborations etc. These achievements have come at an immense price with love and continuous commitment.     This is the final push to get to where I want to be in this field and I am so very determined to get there  but it will require the kindness of peoples hearts to help fund the remaining amount for this year  so I can continue onto my final year of the degree.   Everybody who knows me  will tell you how much LOVE I have for it all  that this is my DREAM and means so much to me! I work on repeat.. raise my son  study  go to work.     I want to set examples to lead by for my little boy to look up to and prove to him  that whatever the sacrifice for the commitment  dive straight in head first and make it work  no matter what. Not only am I doing this for my love for the industry  but to provide my little one a future.     With the unfortunate matter of Covid-19  I am now finding it difficult to save money towards this final sum. Any donations of any kind would be exceptional and so very much appreciated  or even just to read my story and share.     I am trying exceptionally hard to provide and improve myself with the skills needed for my future in Menswear and Textiles  whilst raising my son in a safe secure home.

In this day and age nobody should be living on the streets  everybody should have a place they can call home or a place they feel safe.    Many homeless people in Blackpool have been issued with dispersal orders by simply doing nothing wrong  I personally have come in to contact with some that have been issued with one as they've been sitting in a shop doorway keeping themselves to themselves or been getting their head down for the night on a street. How is this fair  they have nowhere to go? No home  no safe place! They just get moved on to which they locate at another place until they are moved on again.    The homeless need the help of the public to make them feel as though they have a purpose in life  to help them out of the vicious circle they find themselves in as nobody chooses to live on the streets. All they want is a normal life like the rest of us without being judged for the situation they've found themselves in.    I'm not saying I have the answers to be able to resolved this issue however I feel I can make a difference by raising awareness and help raise funds to support people in their time of need so this is why I've decided to do a 2 day sleep out to raise funds to support those in need of a homeless support kit.

Her name is Lin and if karma were real  she would not be living the Hell she's currently in. But what I've learnt in the last few months is that cancer doesn't care who it attacks. Cancer sucks  no doubt about it. It doesn't discriminate or give a crap that she's spent her life helping others. It's aggressive and violent  it's heartbreaking and ruthless. And while she's fighting this vicious disease with every ounce of strength  treatment is expensive and we need help to pay to continue the fight. Lin's insurance has paid up for treatment until now but she needs further radiation as her mouth cancer is very aggressive and has quickly and demonically spread from her tongue to her lymph nodes and into her neck. She doesn't want to ask for help and would think that asking you for help would be bad karma. What's more  she would be adament that there are more deserving causes. What she doesn't realise is that she herself is a deserving cause and it's not because I'm bias. Please let me tell you about her. She spends her days visiting hospitals for mamed street dogs  going to small local temples to pray with the monks and make donations. She raises money for local rescue charities who provide emergency care. She's currently in her hospital bed weighing 34kgs and is busy knitting wool hats. She spends days at a local charity for children with various mental and physical disabilities  feeding the children  playing with them and making them smile. She has rescued cats from holes  dogs from the street  stops to feed the homeless  organises donations to local orphanages. I've known her for many years and she has always donated time and money to every good cause she can find and now please please help me to get her the treatment she needs. The cancer began on her tongue and was growing very fast. Her radiation therapy dates were quickly brought forward and she has now had multiple rounds of chemo and radiation. She is just 42 years young and since the last round of radiation which badly burnt her skin on her neck leaving her with open wounds that need constant care from her elderly mother  she now only weighs 34kgs. Her insurance has recently run out and her family who run a farm are paying for her treatment which is not sustainable. Her partner Black is also paying every baht possible towards her treatment  as are all of her friends. However we now need to spread that net. I'm asking for anyone who can afford to spare a few pounds to please help the kindest  purest  most genuinely beautiful person I've ever met. She can beat it but not without further treatment and for that I really need some outside help from anyone who can. Thank you so much and anyone who donates I'll be giving everyone regular updates on her battle. If you are unable to donate  please just take some time to do something kind for someone else today instead as this is something that will give Lin some comfort. She needs to beat cancer's ass because the world needs more Lins in it. FAO GO FUND ME: 1. My name is Katherine (Katie) Walsh 2. I'm originally from Milton Keynes. I live in Cornwall now having moved back from living in Thailand just under 3 years ago. 3. The person I am fundraising for is my best friend who lives in Thailand. 4. She needs to use the funds raised to pay for more treatment to beat the agressive cancer she has as her insurance has finished paying out. The treatment could be more radiation  more chemo or removal of the tongue and replacing it with flesh they will take from her leg. She is waiting until May to find out what the doctors advise her to do. She is unable to work  her family are taking time off work to care for her  they have to stay close to the hospital so they are renting a small condo next to the hospital. All this and more need to be paid for. 5. I will withdraw funds every day and send them from my bank to her bank. The reason why I didn't add her to withdraw directly is because there was an issue with her being based in Thailand - I was unable to add another fundraiser to the account who was also based in Thailand. Plus she's very sick and I want to keep her admin to a minimum. ",False

We are asking you to help us  by donating what you can to this crowdfund  and joining us on 22 August for an evening of pride  performance and love for Beirut  its people and its reconstruction. Rebuilding Beirut with Pride will be hosted at the Bell Pub in Whitechapel  and live-streamed all night for everyone to watch and take part in. From an art auction to a programme of performance  we want to celebrate Arab and queer art and talent and help rebuild our hometown in the process. Click here to buy your tickets for the event.    Where is the money going?    All proceeds will be equally split and donated to the Lebanese Red Cross  Beit El Baraka   Basmeh & Zeitooneh and Embrace Lebanon   as well as two grassroots LGBT+ crowdfunds  detailed below.     Beit El Baraka provide food banks for victims of the disaster  Basmeh & Zeitooneh are responding on the ground to those who have been made homeless  and Embrace Lebanon offers mental health support.     The NGOs were chosen after having direct discussions with several people within Lebanon itself who informed us of which organisations are trustworthy and are not affiliated with government authorities in any way  to ensure the money is directly going to support those in need first and foremost.    We have also identified two crowdfunds that have been strongly recommended to us by many members of Beirut's LGBTQ+ community  in that they are offering on-the-ground and direct support and are being led by trusted community members.     These crowdfunds are Disaster Relief for Lebanese Transgender Community   led by Lebanese trans pioneer Sasha Elijah  and Funds for LGBTQ Victims of Beirut Explosion   led by prominent community member Sandra Melhem.    The total sum raised will be split 6-way between these 6 beneficiaries  and receipts of these donations will be posted here for completely transparency.     Why are we fundraising?     Beirut is a disaster zone. On the 4th of August  the city was rocked by a colossal explosion involving 2 750 tons of ammonium nitrate. To put things in perspective  it is one of the worse urban explosions since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The blast killed at least 157 people and injured 5 000. Hundreds remain missing. With the force of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake  the explosion's shock wave enveloped Beirut  shattering windows and collapsing old buildings. Lebanon's hospitals - already overrun by coronavirus - are in dire need of support. Meanwhile  around 300 000 people have been displaced from their homes. Two of Beirut's LGBTQ+ hubs  Mar Mikhael and Gemmayze  were only 500m away from the point of detonation. These areas have been utterly devastated and  like many other parts of Beirut  are now uninhabitable.    The blast comes at the worse time for Lebanon  hitting a country already in disaster. Covid-19 exacerbated a pre-existing political and economic crisis  bringing the Lebanese to the brink of collapse. This year has seen thousands of Lebanese lose their lifetime savings and the country's hyper-inflated currency remains in free-fall. One in the three people are unemployed  while amongst Lebanon's poorest  famine is approaching. In short  your donations are needed. They will support those people immediately impacted by the explosion  but also Lebanese communities and families facing economic desolation. Please see below for which NGOs and groups we are donating to.    What's happening on the 22nd?     While we encourage you support us  share this page and ask all your friends to donate throughout the next two weeks  we have an exciting day planned to drum up even more donations!

HAVING RAISED ENOUGH TO FUND 300 BULBS IN JUST FOUR DAYS  WE JUST INCREASED OUR TARGET TO 350! PLEASE LET'S KEEP GOING AND THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTED US!    What do you think Christmas lights look like?   On our recent visit to Rwanda  one of the things that most moved my friend Dan Richardson and I was meeting a homeless widow who had had a house built for her through a tourist project. She proudly showed us her home and also a single light bulb she'd been given which had transformed her life.   Most villagers there still rely on kerosene lamps which provide very poor light and also have terrible effects on health from eye-sight to lungs (I read the other day using a kerosene lamp is the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day). For around $15/£11 a new solar lightbulb can transform home  health and bring life to a village after dark. So simple.   After seeing that  the consumerism of Christmas and the endless drive for gifts back in the UK has been a bit of a shock to adjust back to. My friends and family have been asking what I would like as a gift and I've now arrived at my answer. I'd like solar light bulbs please and that's what I will be giving many people too.   We'd like to open up that opportunity to you guys too. Our aim is to  by Christmas  pay for 100 bulbs for a village in Rwanda. We have friends on the ground there who will ensure the bulbs are bought  distributed and we'll post pictures of that happening too to close the loop. They are £11 each  so a donation of a multiple of that will allow us to buy the number you'd like to donate.  I for one know which lights represent the spirit of Christmas most for me  I hope some of you will agree.  Thank you!",False
"Build Emergency Animal Sanctuary in Palawan","Dorney, South East England, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/palawan-animal-rescue,12000,9634,,2020-04-27,,,0,,"Thousands of animals and pets are abandoned every year in the Philippines  leaving them starving in the streets. The COVID-19 pandemic has made the situation even worse and we need your help now. Help us save thousands of animals' lives by helping us build an animal sanctuary which will prevent the build of a kill shelter by the local government.      Our Story    My partner  Charlotte and I spent 1 month in the Philippines in 2019. During our time there  we noticed that plenty of dogs and other animals were badly mistreated  disease ridden  abandoned or homeless. Having wondered if anyone was helping these animals out  we met Rob and Jacq Martin while dining at their restaurant and found that we had met the saviours of these animals. Here is a little more about their work and their mission.    Rob and Jacq have spent the last 5 years in Port Barton on the island of Palawan in the Philippines. Port Barton is a small town that was rapidly gaining traction as an upcoming tourist destination on the island. With a strong background in hospitality they both created their restaurant 'Mojito's' which funded 80% of their projects with animals in the area. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced them to close their restaurant and essentially put an end to any funding for the animals there.    This puppy was found abandoned in a bush.    Prior to the pandemic  their work with animals has seen them treat over 1200 animals for mange and 550+ sterilised. ""We are facing a terrible situation here. We have lost our ability to look after the animals with the shutdown of our restaurant. Tourism was very helpful as the street animals were able to get more food from tourists which we encouraged. Many travellers told us in all of their journeys through the Philippines that the animals were in much better health here than other places. COVID-19 has destroyed this is in one full swoop. Animals are sick and starving and we are working on an immediate relief program once we get out of lockdown in the next 5 days."" - Rob Martin.          Our Plan    It is obvious that Rob and Jacq need to move towards creating a more stable environment and are committed to building an animal shelter with vet facilities  industrial kitchen and lodgings for volunteers.     They were able to get the local government to halt their plan of setting up a kill shelter at the end of last year but they have been informed that talks will resume for that project if another option isn't presented.        Rob and Jacq have been working closely with Palawan Animal Welfare Foundation Inc and will look at going under their NGO flag as an independent sanctuary.    The total cost of securing land and building this facility in Port Barton is estimated at around $120 000USD/£100 000GBP. This will also include rescue vehicles and a mobile vet facility as the nearest facilities are over 2 hours away.    To help kickstart this project we need to work in phases.     - Phase 1 of the project will look to secure immediate aid for the animals  1 acre of land  building plans  engineering permits  local government permits  NGO status as well as water and electricity.    - Phase 2 will look at building an emergency shelter  kitchen  rescue vehicle and basic staff housing.    - Phase 3 will provide vet facilities and a treatment facility.

We are TESA'S RESCUE.     We are a small group of volunteers who dedicate their spare time to help rescue animals and find them forever homes. We help animals all over the world  but this fund raiser is intended to raise money to acquire a lot where a non-kill animal shelter can be built to house stray cats and dogs from Romania.     The location is near the Danube River  where our 3 amazing volunteers live! All of the cats and dogs they save everyday are taken to their own homes  in their own yards  but they live in busy neighbourhoods  they don't have too much space and it can get very difficult at times to manage all of the animals as well as their personal/work life. Needless to say the neighbours don't quite appreciate the commotion  sometimes noise/smell - and our volunteers cannot just walk past animals needing help  they feel they have a duty of care to help the injured  to house the homeless and feed the hungry.     It would be so much easier if we could help these 3 amazing ladies  Teodora + Selena + Gabriela  acquire a lot near Drobeta Turnu-severin (their home town) where they could build an animal shelter with all of the necessities and keep helping more and more animals  with much more space and definitely less worries!    The average price for a lot with such purpose would be around £8 000. It is indeed a lot of money  however we are confident and determined to make this happen as this could save so many lives. Abandonment in Romania is increasing  people just won't learn  and our volunteers are simply overwhelmed with the number of animals coming into their care - they could of course refuse the cases  but this just means animals will die on the streets  in agony  or brutally killed in the public shelter. The hearts of rescuers who see such horror everyday shatter in millions of pieces  but still they come back stronger than ever to help more and more forgotten souls. I wish we could make the pain go away and ease everyone's lives  so this - at the moment - seems like the way to go!     If you think this is a good cause to support  please do as we will need LOTS & LOTS of help throughout the process! Every little donation matters! We will have invoices/paperwork to justify all costs should you wish to see the legalities etc. We will then need to think of building the fence  kennels  etc - but the volunteers did say they had quite a few acquaintances who could help one way or the other as a favour  so the whole thing might be a bit easier than it looks!

Homeless Organisations (£10 000)    Emmanuel House was awarded £6 000 for additional specialist key worker support to boost its team at a time when Nottingham’s homeless community is at grave risk. This support is helping to ensure the homeless community are being placed into hotel accommodation as an emergency measure as hostels are very vulnerable to outbreaks.       There has also been £4 000 of support released to Framework to enable them to purchase essential items to the Homeless community in Nottingham. This included  but was not limited to  the provision of items such as mobile phones so that they can remain in contact with key workers and minimise the chance of these individuals being unable to stick to the government guidelines on social distancing.       Refugee Groups (£2 500)    Refugee Roots were provided with support to allow them to move from a model that required face to face contact  to being able to still provide support in a safe and socially distanced way.      In addition  Refugee Forum has been provided with funding for a destitution fund to ensure those with no access to support in other places can still get support.       Vulnerable Women (£4 500)    Nottingham Women's Centre have been awarded funding to help them to provide mental health support and online counselling  including training for counsellors to be able to provide online support.      In addition to this  further support was provided to POW Nottingham  an organisation supporting the rights of sex workers and those at risk of being exploited. This funding enabled them to purchase essential items including food and toiletries.      Disability Groups (£2 500)      With social distancing measures causing increased issues for the disability community in Nottingham  this support has enabled the Disability Support Nottingham organisation to increase its capability to provide phone support - in addition to welfare checks - to those in need.      Vulnerable Young People (£2 500)     Funding has also been provided to help support the amazing work of Nottingham YMCA  who are working with the most vulnerable young people in our city during this crisis. The support has helped to provide food and toiletries to those housed in supported YMCA and transitional accommodation.      Where will the funds go?    The most vulnerable people during this crisis and will be administered by the city council and delivered by people and organisations across the city that can help the most vulnerable.    Every Monday Nottingham City Council will administer the release of funds from GoFundMe to Nottingham City Council bank account. This means Nottingham City Council should  on average  have the money in the bank no later than Friday of every week.    Once in Nottingham City Council account the funds are ring fenced and held until the decision re: allocation has been made.    A working group  chaired by Lee Walker  will be set up to recommend how that branch of funds is released. This group is tasked with making the biggest impact possible whilst also being certain that the organisations in receipt a) need and b) promise to spend quickly ie. nobody saves the money. On Tuesday of each week the working group will have a paper approved by a member of ‘gold’ and paperwork will be sent to a small governance committee who are tasked with ethics and assuring the highest standards of governance and distribution.    Remotely the governance group will scrutinise and approve. Once approved Nottingham City Council agrees to distribute as agreed.    Money will then go out asap so groups and organisations are in receipt within 5 days. A one page press note to support and communication online to be transparent.

I have set up this go fund me page for someone I’ve come to know the past few months.    If you’re local to Bexleyheath you may have seen him sitting outside the Asda’s with his beautiful girly ginger Staffie - Brodie.     The young gentleman I am talking a bout is Robbie.     Robbie is homeless  he spends most of his time sitting outside Asda’s  drawing (quite impressive) portraits of people and animals.       Robbie is not a drunk nor does he take drugs  he’s a guy that simply fell on hard times and ended up without a roof over his head.       Every time I speak to Robbie he always has a smile on his face  he is so humble when people donate food  water and money to him. You can see in his eyes how much people’s generosity really does mean so much to him.       Peoples generosity is the only way Robbie is able to eat and drink  and on some nights have a roof over his head.       It’s cost him £25 per night for him and Brodie to have a space in the local hostel at New Cross.       Tonight when I spoke to Robbie he was setting up his tent to sleep for the night  as he hadn’t been donated enough money today to pay the fee.       It truly breaks my heart and I’m sure so many of you also to think about Robbie and Brodie sleeping on the streets of Bexleyheath  especially as the winter cold is creeping in day by day.       My goal is that Robbie and Brodie don’t have to spend one night on the streets this winter!       All of the money raised here will go entirely to Robbie  I’ve set it up to go straight into his bank account (yes you can be homeless and still have a current account).       Please share this page and donate as much as you possibly can so Robbie and Brodie can go to sleep in a warm bed and a safe roof over their head!!     Clara x",False

At the moment the shelter is based at her home  but her landlord is now selling the property and Maria has to move to new premises urgently. This is where we need you to PLEASE help Maria!    Maria’s Cathouse is the only hope many cats in Chania have of surviving. Maria now wants to build a permanent cat shelter  but she needs funds to build enclosures  quarantine areas and fencing to build a safe and secure home for the homeless cats of Chania.    Maria never says no to a cat in need and often steps in when no one else will. Maria is currently caring for approximately 100 cats and she helps to treat and neuter many more. The cats in her care are also re-homed  often abroad  and it is Maria’s aim to neuter as many cats as possible in Chania and provide veterinary treatment for others in need.    Many of the cats in Maria’s Cathouse were on the verge of death when Maria found them and many suffer from long term health conditions. In the photos you can see some of the cats in Maria’s care  cats that would have died without her intervention.    Please help Maria to help the cats of Chania. The situation is at crisis point with no state-sponsored neutering taking place. Maria is determined to transform the lives of Chania’s cats and our priority is to build a safe and secure permanent shelter. Please help us with this project!

This is an urgent appeal for a sister that I know. the sister is a very close relative to my family.    Unfortunately I am in a really bad situation at the moment & it’s a situation I have never been in before.   I really am unable to do anything as I am not working anymore.   I am not entitled to any benefits  I am a full time student & a parent.   Since I have been out of work for some time  I’ve got into rent arrears which exceeds £2300 which I now need to pay in full or bring down as much as I can before April 3rd.   The court has issued an eviction letter for April 3rd as I breeched the payment plan. It’s become very difficult for me & my housing are having no sympathy despite the fact I’ve paid them all my money.    They have just told me if I get evicted I will not be eligible for social housing “as I made intentionally myself homeless” wallahi I just really need to try get as much help from everywhere I can at the moment.   I know we’ve all got things going on in our lives; problems of our own. But if you are able to help  no matter how much I would really appreciate it.   I just don’t know what else to do & this is my last resort.   May Allah reward you tenfold.    Once gofundme releases the raised funds we can then go to the council/housing associations to pay off the outstanding debts  this will then stop bailiffs from coming and evicting her.

"Bangladesh Emergency Action Against COV19 (BEACON)","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/unitedyouthforcovidrelief,20000,21544,,2020-03-24,,,0,,"Follow us on our Facebook Groupfor photos/updates/videos of our work.     Appeal to the World to come forward for Bangladesh:    Bangladesh Emergency Action Against COVID-19 (BEACON) is an emergency fund has been set up to support multiple youth-driven initiatives that are being taken as a part of national effort to take preventive measures against the deadly COVID-19 (""Coronavirus"") outbreak in Bangladesh.       Bangladesh  one of the poorest countries in the world  is entering a critical stage of COVID-19 outbreak with the disease progressing into the ""growth stage"" that can potentially impact millions. Given the fact that Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely populated countries (population: 170 million) with a healthcare system that is ill-equipped to handle mass numbers of COVID19-infected patients  the numbers of COVID-19 related deaths (which are already on the rise) are expected to be unparalleled if appropriate measures are not taken on time.       Already listed as a ""high risk"" country for coronavirus spread by the United States  we don't know where this deadly pandemic will take Bangladesh. We don't know at this point if this crisis will be worse than Italy and if Bangladesh will be the new epicenter of this disease. However  one thing we do know for sure is that we need to prepare with everything we have to STOP the outbreak and TAKE PREVENTIVE MEASURES.    In these trying times for the country  an army of youth (the country’s BEACON of hope)  has come forward with effective initiatives to keep the country safe  reduce the rate of transmission (flattening the curve in the process)  and provide essential items to the most vulnerable population that are likely to be worst hit.         Therefore  we are appealing to the World Community to come forward and lend your generous helping hand to support these valiant youth initiatives that will ultimately make the difference and help Bangladesh to avoid a human catastrophe that could very well spiral out of control.     Below are some of the initiatives that will be further bolstered by your support:    - Preparing and distributing PPE (""Personal Protective Equipment"") to doctors and nurses who are risking their lives to save people     - Providing food ration to the most vulnerable population that are likely to be badly impacted by reduced economic activities and lock down imposed by the government to contain the COVID-19. This population include the people with the lowest income in the society (i.e. homeless  rickshaw-puller  auto-drivers/CNG drivers  day laborers  and etc.)     - Providing free meals to the poor/homeless people (they will need support with food/meals/daily nutrition intake especially in these difficult times)     - Providing hand sanitizers and face-masks to the vulnerable population to prevent community spread among slums and low-income groups (for sure they won't be able to support the medical expenses if they are affected)     - Buying ingredients to make hand sanitizers (the ingredients are expensive now that they are short in supply and we want to use the fund to help youth initiatives that are preparing hand sanitizers)     - Setting up temporary hand washing stations in different key points of the city     - Distributing hand washing liquid packs  soap  and other hygiene products to prevent COVID-19 spread - Spraying disinfectants in public areas (i.e.  bus stations  ferry terminals and etc.)    - And many other initiatives that will be taken up as relevant with the evolving situation     Who will be the beneficiary of your generous support:    - Youth led groups in different parts of Bangladesh that have already started working on several initiatives (as listed above) – they need additional funding to continue their momentum    - Youth led initiatives that have already organized themselves and are waiting for funding to start working    - Small community youth groups that do not have adequate funding sources and need support to protect their community through activities that are listed above    - The funds are intended to be distributed among youth groups in different parts of Bangladesh that include DHAKA  CHITTAGONG  SYLHET  RAJSHAHI and KHULNA and other smaller communities and cities       In these desperate times when the future is uncertain for Bangladesh  we are appealing to the World Community  especially the non-resident Bangladeshis  to come forward in our efforts to raise funds for critical youth initiatives that are cause/impact-driven and have widespread reach.     Together we can beat COVID-19  together we can heal as ONE nation and as ONE world.     We will be uploading pictures of these wonderful youth initiatives and their impact so that you can stay informed about the change that you have helped to create.      Additional Information:     Why ""BEACON Bangladesh""?    “BEACON Bangladesh” is a short term used for Bangladesh Emergency Action Against COV-19.    The primary goal of this fundraising initiative is to support the many youth initiatives in Bangladesh who are valiantly helping their communities to fight against COVID-19. The youth initiatives are mostly community action groups who have mobilized themselves to stand by the nation in critical times. These youth groups either do not have adequate funding or have access to funding to realize their full potential. Therefore  BEACON Bangladesh has been set up to connect the world community (especially expat Bangladeshis) to these youth initiatives who  despite all the challenges and public health emergency  are leading from the front to help the country’s effort to safeguard itself from COVID-19.     Who are we and where are we from?    Bangladesh Emergency Action Against COV-19 has been set up by two close friends  Ashfaque and Fahim  who know each other since childhood.     Ashfaque Kabir  the organizer  has worked in the development sector with a focus on youth related projects in Bangladesh. He is currently working as a consultant and has a wide network of youth leaders all around Bangladesh who are working to build a better nation.     Fahim Chowdhury is an entrepreneur and a former investment banker based out of London. Fahim has a keen interest in development and makes it a point to take time out of his daily life to contribute to the society. Fahim has a strong network of British Bangladeshis in London and tries to help the Bangladeshi community in England in whatever way he can.     Our relationship or contact to the intended recipients of your campaign’s donations:    Ashfaque has a wide network of youth leaders all over in Bangladesh by way of his work in the development sector for more than three years. At a time of national crisis  he is utilizing this strong network to mobilize youth leaders and support them in the many projects (i.e. helping to distribute PPE  distributing food ration among underprivileged people and etc) that they are working on. Given that Ashfaque’s job involved teaching  some of these youth leaders are his direct students or his former colleagues and Ashfaque knows them personally and well enough to have the trust that all the campaign donation will be used efficiently.     Given Ashfaque and Fahim’s background in Finance  all the expenses will be rigorously audited to maintain transparency and efficiency on the recipient’s end.     A clear explanation of how the donations would be spent:     Ashfaque and Fahim have already selected a youth initiative that they want to boost through providing initial financing or additional financing to help them start or expand their work.     These youth initiatives are working in diverse group of projects. Here are some of the groups that we'd be working with:     - Hope of Mohammadpur: A group of young dynamic individuals are working in Magura (District: Khulna) to raise awareness on COVID-19  set up hand washing plants in crowded places  distributing food ration among the underprivileged population that is worst hit. BEACON has committed to fund them so that they can expand their work and help keep their community safe from impact of COVID-19.     - Tarunner Agradoot: This is a youth-based initiative in Chandpur who are working to help poor farmers who have been acting as suppliers to the markets in major cities. Given the “national lockdown” imposed by the government  these suppliers are currently facing a critical situation with their products unsold. They are facing difficult economic times and this organization is supporting them by providing food ration.     -  Team Chittagong: This is a dynamic youth organization based in Chittagong who are renowned for their youth activism. This group is working to provide hand sanitizers and other amenities to the underprivileged people as well as providing them with groceries for them to survive these difficult times. This team is focusing on the outskirts of Chittagong where not much relief has reached as yet     -  We are Tangail: This a group of volunteers who are working together to serve the underprivileged population in the Tangail district (an area just outside the capital). This group has ambitious plans and wants to continue their work of providing food ration to the ultra-poor in different neighborhoods of Tangail. This is an excellent project because the group is focusing on areas where help/support from administration conventionally fail to reach.     Plan to get the campaign’s donations to the intended recipient(s):    The selected youth initiatives are required to submit an Action Plan along with a budget. Once the budget is scrutinized by both Ashfaque and Fahim (“the team”)  the team will decide on the amount that they want to commit. Once the decision is made the team would disburse the fund accordingly through cheque/ online bank transfer/ mobile financial service to the designated bank account of the selected youth initiative.     Ashfaque will continue to maintain communication with the team on the field  monitor the work as well as scrutinize the deliveries (all youth initiatives are required to sign accountability forms with specific terms and conditions and provide proof of their work).     A second layer audit will be completed by Fahim following Ashfaque’s report – all work will go through two layers of scrutiny to ensure all deliveries are made as per promise.
