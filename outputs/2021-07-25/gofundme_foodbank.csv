Having had a mental breakdown and suicide attempt I was struggling mentally and financially. I went to the food bank and while there I had a mini breakdown. This is when I met [Zink Advice Worker] Julie. Julie was extremely easy to talk to and quickly gained my trust to be able to talk to her. She helped me sort through piles of paperwork  speaking to people about bills and debts  getting me to speak to the right people to help me and being there when I just needed to talk. Since September I have been diagnosed with autism and the biggest problem I had was a debt to my landlord of over £4000 for which they had an eviction order. Julie was instrumental in helping me get a court hearing where the eviction was suspended. Julie's knowledge was brilliant and made we aware of funds/benefits available to me and because of this in under nine months I have been able to pay off (through myself and funds) the entire arrears and have the eviction set aside. For the first few months I was also reliant on the food bank side while my money git sorted.  I cannot thank Julie (and Zink and high peak food bank) enough for the last nine months. Without her and them I certainly wouldn't be in as good a position as I am now - mentally  financially and emotionally.   I want to give back and as I am not working I don't have the means to give what I want.   This is my thank you. Please help me so that they can continue to help people back on their feet the way they have helped me.   In addition to this I have had some lovely people on here and B and Q donate materials for making a mosaic and Buxton Woodwork  Buxton building supplies and Markovitz have all donated enough materials for me to make around six bird tables and several bird boxes. These will be being sold and auctioned off by Zink/food bank for some more money for them.   Thank you in advance as I say thanks to them",False

response to COVID-19 we are raising vital funds so that the Foodbank can respond to increasing demand. We are facing an unprecedented challenge and so any donation will be warmly welcomed as we continue to support people most in need.    I am Rev Carol Bostridge  Senior Project Manager of Lewisham Foodbank  I live in Sydenham and have been employed part-time by the Foodbank for 5 years.     All donations given via this campaign will be used by Lewisham Foodbank to either purchase food for our clients or enhancing the service we offer (eg providing volunteers with gloves  setting up a delivery service for those self isolating and purchasing addition equipment as needed).     All donations will be given directly to Lewisham Foodbank which is part of a registered charity (Transform Network) and their trustees will oversee the spending of the money and produce clear accounts.",False

Over 90% of the food distributed by foodbanks in The Trussell Trust network is donated by the public.

Our family were in awe by his altruistic desire to give  feed and aid ALL  despite race/ethnicity/religion among him even whilst suffering himself.     Since opening  our family alone have vetted 25 families with monthly food rations from December 2019- present. Unfortunately  25 families do not cover the innumerable amount of people starving  for whom we want to share some light  hope and nurture to amidst dark times  that is their indefinite reality.    Our foodbank prioritises poor families with children  single mothers/widowers and those who themselves or their children suffer with debilitating mental/physical health issues trying to make ends meet to provide for their children- this is done with rigorous checks by our team to ensure nobody exploits such a service. The families are issued with a monthly ration card valid for 12 months which provides them with stock for each month as per the individual needs of the family. These include: 10kg chapati flour (atta)  5kg sugar  5kg various lentils/daal  5kg rice  5L cooking oil  tea leaves  salt  spices and other necessary food items. £25 will feed a family of 5 for the month however any donation  no matter how big or small will impact them greatly.     100% of the donationsgo to those in need  with our incredible staff being voluntary workers (so no wages or salaries are deducted from donations) and our facilities funded with the finances that the late Safdar Hussain Shah left behind for us to carry this out in his legacy- we are relying on your kind donations which will solely provide stock for the families.     During the current COVID-19 crisis  we are aiming to try and provide emergency food supplies to all those suffering in the locale  with the most vulnerable holding priority  we are giving out thousands of food rations but are broken to see that we are unable to extend our help to everyone that needs it- as a small start-up charity  we are grateful for all the support and donations we receive in order to help us reach as many individuals suffering from the crisis as possible.     Unfortunately  we can't do this alone  with the power of unity together we can help fill the stomachs of the poor  not only with food but also the fulfilment of life and hope they may gradually receive from your donations. Our brothers and sisters around the globe need us  we are united by our efforts.   Any donation  no matter how big or small will be greatly appreciated especially in the blessed month of Ramadan  whereby charity is considered its greatest.     We are not the givers  we are just Allah SWT  the Almighty's  servants and can only give what he allows and wishes to be given. The families we aim to feed is by the grace of Allah SWT and it is he who provides to all.     May Allah SWT accept this from you and me  may we fulfil our duty by helping those in need  for which it is their right upon you and I.    “A man’s true wealth is the good he does in this world.” Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W)    Instagram: sadaqajariya.foodbank for further updates",False

This support started when there was no halal food support in the local area of Sharrow and Netheredge and people were struggling to buy basic food for themselves. Due to a gap in the area and a desperate need TSY collaborated with few others to collectively reach out to the most vulnerable including single parents  elderly  self isolating and hardship such as loss of income. All our work is voluntary and since March kind donations from local community has assisted us in making sure no one struggled alone. We are running low on cash donations to purchase food to continue this vital support and are reaching out to anyone who can support us by using this link and donating whatever little they can towards the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank project. Due to the level of need and referrals coming in since the start of this halal foodbank  we have called it Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank to avoid any barriers to any non-muslim vulnerable that maybe in need of this support. We would be very grateful for your support towards this cause and request you to please share widely amongst your contacts.

The fall off in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that we have had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased our costs significantly.

GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw Since We Care was launched as the UK's largest independent food bank and advice and support hub in Lewisham in 2014  we have always ensured that  during school holidays and Christmas  children and the hungry families they come from do not have to worry about putting food on the table. This half term  however  and over this coming Christmas  we truly need your help to feed the new wave of people and pets from across London who are in crisis and will be coming through our doors this winter at Kath's Place  50 Friendly Street  Deptford SE8 4DR.    Can you imagine losing up to 40% of your monthly income? That is the reality for so many people in the present crisis. Rents are so high in our area that people in work do not have enough cash to pay the rent and  probably for the first time in their lives  are having to trade a visit to their local coffee shop for a visit to the We Care Food Bank and Food Pantry for help  advice  support and solidarity. Embarrased and even ashamed  but even more desperate and distraught that their kids are going hungry  mums tell us that they can go days without food  and  on average  it takes people at least a week of going hungry before they finally come through our doors and ask for help. We really do need your donation this Christmas GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw . Becasue we help everyone and anyone and do not focus on one particular group (such as refugees or the homeless) we get absolutely NO national or local government funding or any other type of funding.

A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems. Barrow Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. There has never been a more crucial time to help those who are less fortunate than us - which is why I have organised this event.     The Covid-19 effect   Well before Covid-19 hit the UK  food banks in the Trussell Trust network had been seeing year-on-year increases in levels of need  with 1.9 million emergency food parcels given out in 2019/20. As Covid-19 hit the UK  the Trussell Trust saw an immediate and sustained surge in need across its food banks. In April there was an 89% increase in the number of emergency food parcels given out compared with the same month in 2019. This included a 107% increase in the number of parcels given to children  compared to the same period last year. New findings show that almost 100 000 households received support from a food bank in the Trussell Trust network for the very first time between April and June 2020. It's no secret that the pandemic has had a significant impact on people's jobs and finances - increasing the use of foodbanks nationwide.     What are we doing?   Since March 2020  many people (including myself) have adopted a new hobby in running. Whether it is to pass time  get out of the house  keep fit whilst the gyms are closed or a tool to manage your mental health. Everyone has their individual reasons for running and it would be fantastic to use this as an opportunity to help and support our local foodbank through completing a half marathon challenge (13.1 miles or 21.09 kilometres).     When?  Those who are taking part will complete the run on either Friday 23rd April  Saturday 24th April or Sunday 25th April - uploading their run to the page when complete.     Donations  There is a group target amount of £1 000 and every penny donated is hugely appreciated. However  I am conscious of the financial difficulties that many people face due to the current situation  therefore  it is absolutely fine if you are unable to donate - you can always share this page instead!

Many individuals and families have suffered additional hardship during this period and demand for foodbank services has increased significantly over this time and continues to rise. The ending of the furlough scheme at the end of October is likely to result in this demand increasing further as more people are unfortunately likely to be made redundant.    The foodbank at Danebury Drive has been run since the start of lockdown by one individual from her own front garden. Initially this was on a small scale helping a number of local families  but has grown significantly to the point where currently 50 food parcels are produced weekly with an addition 75 individuals access the food on offer for collection for themselves and families.    As a result  the foodbank has become a valuable resource for families on the North and East sides of Acomb. This is one of a network of community foodbanks set up across the city who are all working together to share resources best they can.    The onset of winter means that to continue premises need to found as running this outside with no cover will no longer be viable. Premises have been found at a local church with the offer of a peppercorn rent. In addition to rent funding will be required to cover rent and fuel costs    The foodbank currently receives a significant amount of food donations from Co-op  Fareshare and Morrisons amongst others which is mainly of items such as bread and non-perishable items. Whilst the support has been amazing  this rarely provides sufficient fresh items to support the need  hence the additional purchase of such items mentioned above. Clearly such nutritional items are required for an individual to have a balanced diet  made more important by the fact that many children are supported by the bank.    Up to date the £250pw for fresh items has been covered by a weekly £200pw purchase of produce by a local charity (Kitchen for Everyone York) with the additional made up by the small amount of monetary donations received at the foodbank. However  the current level of support from Kitchen for Everyone cannot be maintained and their support has dropped to £100pw due to a shortage of funding. This level of funding will be continued until the end of 2020.    The costs of powering the fridge freezers and fuel for collection has been borne by the individual running the bank  but this cannot be maintained.    Your help is requested to help continue the service that has been so invaluable for the local community  especially as there are concerns that demand is more likely to increase in the short term rather than decline.",False

Thousands of people are suddenly out of work and literally cannot put food on the table.    According to the Trussell Trust’s data  families with children have been hit the hardest by the pandemic and over 1.2 million food parcels were given out to people during the crisis by the Trust from 1st April to 30th September 2020. The Trust estimates that a further 670 000 people will be getting into poverty in 2021 where they will not be able to afford essentials like food and energy utilities.    More people have now died from coronavirus in the second wave than the first wave. In the UK to date  a total of 97 329 people have died due to the pandemic and over 3.62 million people have been infected and the numbers are rising.     According to the Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance  the new variant of the virus spreads between 30% and 70% faster than others and hence it is 30% more deadly (BBC). It is now mandatory to use face masks in various indoor settings as per the UK government guidelines. (GOV.UK)    When people cannot afford to put food in their mouths how could they afford to buy a face mask to cover their mouths?    IT IS TIME TO ACT NOW AND DO SOMETHING TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE NEW VIRUS VARIANT!    With the support of GoFundMe  I have started the campaign   “Face Masks 4 Foodbanks” to help provide face masks to foodbanks which they will distribute to their users.     Your donations will be spent on buying face masks at supplier’s cost price which will be donated to the hundreds of families who get food parcels from the following food banks.     1. Newham Foodbank  2. Tower Hamlets Foodbank - Firstlove Foundation   3. Ealing Foodbank  4. Hackney Foodbank  5. Brent Foodbank  6. Hounslow Community FoodBox  7. Bow Food Bank - Newham  8. The Felix Project  9. The Open Kitchen  10. Feltham Foodbank  11. St Paul's (Hounslow) Food Bank    Your donations will help these foodbank users to not only protect themselves but also to keep the more vulnerable safe from being infected by the virus through the coronavirus droplets from coughs  sneezes and speaking.    Together  let’s stop the spread of COVID-19 and ease the pressure on our NHS services. I hope the people of the UK will continue to show their kindness  compassion and generosity during these unprecedented times and with your donation  we can win the battle of the unseen enemy COVID-19.

Its a distance of 25 miles which will take me over Pen-y-ghent  Whernside and Ingleborough which are some rather big hills! The money I raise will be split evenly between the two charities and I am hoping to reach a target of 1000 which will hopefully go a long way in supporting people in need around Doncaster.       In 2019 I had been suffering with depression for a number of years but eventually sought professional help and it genuinely transformed my life and has given me a whole new outlook and purpose. I was fortunate to have the support of my family and friends when I truly needed it most. I was also able to pay for the help I needed  but not everyone is that lucky. That's why 50% of what we raise will go to MIND mental health charity  because they offer a free counselling service to people who need it most  who sometimes don't have that support bubble.   Doncaster Food Bank work tirelessly all year round and depend on the generosity of our community to do what they do. So I want to do my part to help as I don't believe anyone should go hungry or not be able to feed their families. Any of us could depend on a charity like this one day  you never know.

It’s crazy how the pandemic we currently living in has caused all kinds of financial difficulties situations and families have had no choice but to turn to the food banks for help and assistance. I know that raising money will help the food bank buy essential food. It saddens me to see how the numbers have doubled as more people are being impacted by COVID-19 with job losses and furlough leaving families struggling to find money to buy enough food. We have all seen the headlines regarding school meals but it's easy to forget for a lot of these children that is the only balanced meal they will get. In the first six months of the pandemic  some food banks in the United Kingdom gave out a staggering 1.2 million emergency food parcels. That’s one food parcel every 13 seconds  and 2 600 of these went to children every day on average. I decided to walk 2021 km and hopefully get this achieved within 10 months. So if you see me walking please give me a cheer and some motivational comments. Every penny helps put food on the table and allowing families to try not stress financially or have to choose between food and heating. So please consider donating to a worthy cause.    So I'm looking for your support. Together we can make a difference.  ",False

It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has launched to support our community and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.  The Lambeth Food Bank Fund   Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.   In Lambeth we have a history of looking after one another - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.   So we are creating something called the Lambeth Food Bank Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.   Our borough has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has been set up for us to help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.   Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Lambeth. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.     * * *   FAQs  What can I do?  Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the most vulnerable.   Where will the funds go?  The funds will go to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by Holy Trinity Clapham and delivered to food banks across the borough - including Brixton & Norwood  Clapham Park  Vauxhall  and Waterloo - that can help the most vulnerable.   If I do donate will it go to those who need it?   Yes  your donation will go to those who need it. Unlike other platforms  GoFundMe do not charge a fundraising fee although they take a small transaction fee. See here for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to.   I want to help my local community  will this money be spent in Lambeth?   Yes.   Where can I find accurate information about covid-19?   For general information on CV-19  please visit the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response  Lambeth Council have some useful information: https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/elections-and-council/about-lambeth/coronavirus-covid-19-information  If you are worried about your own health  call the NHS on 111.

This is an exciting chapter in Canterbury Food Bank’s history  and a brilliant opportunity for us to grow and change in response to new challenges. But it is also an expensive chapter; our previous premises were occupied on a peppercorn lease of £10 a month  so by paying the market rate for a suitable property our rental costs have been multiplied 133 times.     We are asking our community to help us raise a year of rent - £16 000 - up front so that all other funds can be used to buy and deliver food. Please donate and share this appeal widely to secure the future of the Food Bank as a key charity in the district.     PRESS RELEASE -    Canterbury Food Bank today launched a campaign to help pay for its new building - after its rent multiplied 133 times.     The charity is moving to another warehouse  specially converted to suit its needs  because the lease on its current premises has come to an end.    CFB had been paying a peppercorn rent of £10 a month for the old building  but will now have to pay market rate of £16 000 a year.     Its Raise the Rent campaign aims to cover the rental costs so that all other funds can be used to buy and deliver food. The new  bigger warehouse  near Whitstable  secures the future of CFB as a key charity in the district.     Demand in the past 12 months has at times more than trebled year-on-year and in December it provided enough food to make more than 10 000 meals.     The economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 crisis  and the uncertainty of Brexit  are the main reasons behind the spike.    The charity has signed a five-year lease on the 3 780 square foot  two storey warehouse  which will be used to store donations of food and as an office.     CFB chair Martin Ward said: “We’re pleased and relieved to have secured our long-term future at a time when our services have never seen such high demand.     “It has become clear over the past year that  even more than ever  a backstop is needed to help those who can not afford food.     “We are that backstop and it is our intention to remain so for as long as we are required.     “These are difficult times for many people and we ask the public to help us support those most in need.”    CFB provides emergency three-day food parcels to individuals and families in financial need across Canterbury  Whitstable  Herne Bay and surrounding villages.    It has donation baskets in all leading supermarkets including Sainsbury’s  Tesco  Asda and Morrisons  where people can leave dried or tinned food items. ",False

Due to the pandemic  countless numbers of small and local businesses have been forced to close - with barbershops/hair salons being examples of the businesses that are suffering the most. Now  the normal response for the owner of a business like this would be to take advantage of rate relief  seek bridge funding for the business and also look for financial support being offered to people that are self-employed.    But not Ziggy...        Ziggy has converted the Barbershop into a Food Bank that is specifically focused on helping the elderly and other vulnerable members of the local community to have access to the food and sustenance they need in a time when it may be challenging to make trips to supermarkets or go shopping themselves.    We all know that local businesses like barbershops are massive pillars within communities as they are connected to so many people and aware of a range of local issues. So  who better and where better for a Food Bank to support vulnerable people to come from?        As it stands  Ziggy is not only travelling (on his own dime) to his shop  to the homes of people who cannot make it to his Food Bank and even spending his own money to buy food if he is short on donations from local people that are aware his Food Bank Exists. ALL WHILST HE IS LOSING MONEY AS HE CANNOT TRADE AND RUN HIS BUSINESS AS NORMAL.    So  now we need to support this local hero by helping to alleviate the financial pressure that comes from still having to maintain the utility costs at the shop  the transport costs that come with running the Food Bank and also to help access further food to support vulnerable local people.",False

I couldn't find anywhere and it occurred to me that whilst we had lots of foodbanks we didn't have any for children's clothes or toys and if you can't afford to put food on the table you cant afford to buy clothes or toys for your child either.    Sebby's Corner  named in honour of my late brother  began only a month ago and yet the demand for our services is increasing daily. We hear stories of families who are choosing whether to eat or heat their homes  parents who go without food so their kids can eat.     We are working with foodbanks and schools across Herts  Barnet  Middlesex and London to reach as many vulnerable families as we can.    We have been so grateful for your donations of preloved clothes and toys. You've inundated us and we can't thank you enough. Now we need your help in a different way. There are lots of items our families desperately need that we need to buy new  such as underwear  nappies  baby milk and toiletries.    We would be so grateful for your help so we don't have to turn anyone away.    Your money will be used to purchase:  - Nappies  - Wipes  - Baby food  - Formula  - Baby soap  - Childrens toothbrushes   - Childrens toothpaste  - Childrens shampoo  - Maternity pads  - Breast pads  - Nappy cream  - Children's underwear  - Storage boxes (to store your donated clothes and toys)    Anything you can contribute will be so appreciated.

We are an entirely self funded volunteer led group of like minded local people  young and old  who wanted to do something to help the homeless and needy in our neighbourhood. So in November 2018 we founded the Tooting Community Kitchen. Since then we have run a weekly distribution of hot food  and essential supplies. We now have 50 active volunteers and we have been able to assist hundreds of people  so far!    Currently  every Wednesday and Saturday evening our volunteers are able to provide the following help:    • We distribute food packs to a local shelter for homeless people  • We set up a stall from 5.30pm to 6.30pm next to Tooting Broadway Market where we serve hot food  soups  drinks and hand out toiletries and sanitary products  • we have recently opened our foodbank based at 104 Upper Tooting Rd  SW17 7EN  walk up Price Close. Fridays 9-1pm food donations drop off. Fridays 11-1pm open to guests to collect what they need. Our outreach volunteers visit known places where homeless people sleep in the local community and we provide them with a hot meal  a hot drink  toiletries and sanitary products and sleeping bags  • Our outreach teams are now able to serve people in areas of Wandsworth (Clapham Junction  Putney High Street  and Clapham South / Common / and North.      We urgently need donations so this much needed work can carry on in the community.     Please help us to help those in need.      Tooting Community Kitchen",False

As the lockdown is eased  some people will be more aware than others that the pandemic is not over.    The most vulnerable people - those who have been shielded  have been receiving food parcels. They have been advised that they no longer have to shield beyond August 16th. We believe that this means that they will no longer get their weekly food parcel.    We are also aware of other people who for whatever reason  can’t get enough food. Predictions are for greater economic squeezes  which means that more people will fall into this category.    Prior to covid  the office of Leanne Wood in Porth had worked with the free-share scheme to offer free food to people who wanted it: this is food that the supermarkets would normally throw away. This food was provided on a non-means tested basis to anyone who could make use of it. (We also worked closely with the Rhondda foodbank to provide non-perishable food to them that they could make use of for people in need).    This scheme has to be put on hold when covid broke because it was not possible to do it while social distancing.    Social distancing is still an issue  but food poverty and food need is a growing problem. With the shielded group no longer having their weekly food parcel from mid August - and with supermarkets sending food to landfill if it can’t be distributed - all means we need to restart the scheme  but do it differently.    This is where you can help.    We need to raise money - around £5 000 should enable us to operate a scheme up until the end of the year.    We can then purchase extra items so that together with the supermarket excess  we can make up balanced food parcels for anyone who asks for one.    We will be relying on our team of Plaid Cymru councillors as well as the network of volunteers to both pack food and deliver it to people throughout the Rhondda.    If you can donate and also share this link on your social media channels  that would help this new project immensely.    Back in March  nearly six hundred people in the Rhondda responded to a call-out to sign up as a community volunteer  to be a part of a network to support and keep an eye out for others in their community as the covid pandemic took hold and people had major concerns about lockdown.    Some of those volunteers carried out weekly shopping and collected monthly prescriptions for their neighbours all the way through lockdown. This Rhondda network demonstrates what a fantastic community we live in. People here have been through so much with floods  precarious economic conditions  the loss of so many important local services - yet we still band together to help those who need it.

50/2020-09-23 100/2020-09-23 15/2020-09-23 200","The Great Oven has been building giant community ovens and sending them to places of need for over two years – to refugee camps  war-torn communities  and now inner cities in crisis.     Born in Tripoli  Northern Lebanon and operating in refugee camps in the Bekaa Valley throughout the COVID pandemic  we are now responding to the Beirut blast.     With the full endorsement of the Lebanese Foodbank  each of our ovens is capable of producing over 1 000 meals per day. Our plan is to greatly increase this reach by expanding our number of oven sites nationwide.     Our Work To Date    Today  the Great Oven HQ is located next to the epicenter of the blast site  in Lebanon’s most respected nightclub of all places  the Ballroom Blitz. Each day  between 10 - 20 local volunteers contribute to the preparation of meals and supplies which are then distributed to our oven sites.     Over a month on from the blast  with media fatigue setting in and many temporary relief efforts already withdrawing  our work is crucial. We believe that responses to Lebanon’s escalating crisis must be long term in their vision and center the Lebanese people as agents of their own reconstruction and resilience-building process.    By its very nature  The Great Oven is uniquely positioned to provide assistance through this framework. Not only do we set up enduring networks but our ovens are permanent installations that belong to the communities in which they are based. As centres for cooking  teaching and sharing a meal  our ovens facilitate a creative and participatory experience that brings communities together and fosters social cohesion.     Where will your support go?    The Great Oven has self-funded its operations for over two years. We are proud of our self-sustainability but now feel it is time to grow. We can’t do this without your support.    Each kind donation will be used to fund our basic operational costs  all of which are listed below:    - Production and installation of more community ovens in areas of critical need in Beirut and nationwide  - Sourcing local food produce for each oven  - Distribution of food beyond Great Oven sites across the city  - Oven transport and logistics     Our only paid salaries to date  go to marginalised people we founded our movement with. This includes LGBTQ refugees  stateless youths  trafficked women  and ex child fighters to name a few.     More about the Great Oven    We build great big beautiful ovens to feed a great number of people.     But the oven is also symbolic. It represents our belief that the ritual of cooking and sharing meals helps bring communities together  whatever their faith  ethnicity or gender.     We also believe in the rehabilitative power of music and art to restore faith that a better future is possible.     What we offer is not aid in the traditional sense  but the participatory tools to empower a community to build that future for themselves  and with those tools comes an inherent sense of dignity  which is as important as food relief in nourishing a marginalised community.     We work with grassroots  on-the-ground  local initiatives and organisers in order to respond organically and effectively to each community’s unique needs.     What we’re offering in return     The Great Oven was founded by award-winning cook  documentary filmmaker and philanthropist  James Thompson. Our wider team is a collective of chefs  artists and creative thinkers dedicated to making positive change through food and art.     We are eternally grateful for any donation  no matter how big or small. For any substantial contributions  we would like to offer a very special thank you in true Great Oven style:    Donations of £1 000 or more    A private Great Oven feast cooked by Great Oven chefs (and special guests) at your home.    Donations of £250 or more    A seat at a one-off Great Oven community feast in one of the following locations:    Barcelona  Beirut  Berlin  Denver  Dublin  Glastonbury  Johannesburg  Kuala Lumpur  Kinsale  London  Mexico City  Mumbai  New York   Valencia    These feasts will feature several special guests of the culinary  music and art worlds.

We need your help to continue to provide for all those in need of support just now.    Since Lockdown in March 2020  the Punjab Restaurant in Covent Garden has been cooking to feed anybody and everybody in need. More than 100 000 hot meals have been provided to homeless organisations; Nishkam SWAT  Gur Seva  Under One Sky and our local church St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square. During the first lock down half the restaurant was converted to HQ  packing and storage facility for Under One Sky. We are doing the same for this second lock down.     Despite business being affected by the pandemic  in our 74 years  the Punjab has never closed its kitchens. MD Amrit Maan has been determined to make the restaurant a community resource to help as many as possible through this difficult moment in history.    All this has been possible with the goodwill of our staff  our own reserves and ability to purchase in bulk  but also from donations of food from businesses that had to close and partnering charities.     Our ""engine"" – our kitchen and volunteering staff - is running at full speed  with the Covent Garden community spirit.       BUT we now need your support to purchase raw ingredients and containers to see struggling families and the homeless through the festive period and into January.    Your donations will be used for basic healthy ingredients: potatoes  onions  cauliflower  baked beans  chick peas  red split lentils and rice.     The cost per serving/box is approximately £1.50 and we’re asking for just 60p towards each serving. We need to serve 1000 meals a week  so our £4800 target will result in 8000 meals to those struggling daily  though we note the need is only increasing.      We’ll be posting regular updates of how your donations are being spent and who it has helped.     It is getting colder every day and we’re heading towards the festive holidays  which will be a difficult one for so many more this year. Even £2 will provide 3-4 servings.     Please dig deep and help if you can – every little counts.",False

Since then the group has gone from strength to strength and has evolved from a Covid-response team to a real Community Group that highlights what an amazing community we have in Nailsea.       We have a process in place to make sure all funds donated to the group are spent on current community projects and future legacy projects which are in the best interest of the residents of Nailsea. Any spending is reviewed and voted on before being approved by the Nailsea Community Group Management Team.      We still have over 170 volunteers who have made over 6 000 shopping deliveries and over 4 000 prescription deliveries. We still support over 30 households with our own emergency Foodbank and our referrals to the Trussell Trust at Southfield Road. We still have 104 active Community Buddies supporting residents every week.      Community Larder - this has been established to stop food from going to waste and is supported by local shops  both independently and through the charities FareShare  Neighbourly  and FoodShare. It has an average of 55 visits a day and is open to all residents and has no impact on our Foodbank stock. #feedbelliesnotbins       Community Food Club - this is open to those who receive benefits. Membership costs £1 per household and entitles members to a weekly bag of store-cupboard items worth over £10 for £3.50.        End Holiday Hunger - When schools are not running we are endeavouring to provide food for every child in Nailsea who receives Free School Meals in term time.      Nailsea Active - this initiative continues to inspire people to stay mentally and physically active and to make the most of our amazing local facilities.        We are very proud to live in Nailsea and would not be able to provide the above without every volunteer along with every resident  business  and organisation that has helped us along the way.

Wycombe Food Hub (WFH) came about at the start of lockdown. We collected residual food from leading supermarkets. Our products are often short dated and expired ‘Best Before End’ (BBE) dates. These products are still usable. The range varies on what we source each week from our partners. During the peak we were collecting over 200 green crates each week and supplying food to partner organisations who were using our produce in 100 meals a week plus 1000 food bags a week What we do We supply products to people unable to access or buy food  those that cannot get Government aid or are unable to survive on the Government’s benefit payments  those who are now suffering from loss of jobs and the self-employed who can’t get benefits  those who cannot access the traditional referral foodbanks. Also  Police referrals  refugees  pensioners  YMCA residents  homeless. The range of people coming to us for help is growing weekly. Considering what’s happening nationally the need for our food and services will continue to grow. Our growth We secured a small warehouse(room) and opened a market stall under the Guildhall in High Wycombe twice a week for 2 hours. We are now collecting over 300 green crates week and giving out 150 bags of food in 4 hours each week. In addition  supplying food to our partner organisations who are feeding in excess of 300 people a week. What is next We have now become a social enterprise CIC to allow us to formalise what we are doing. We have now secured a retail shop in the centre of High Wycombe. The shop will be open a minimum of 3 days a week. We have a warehouse in the store where we can sort and distribute food. This will allow us to both run the shop feeding those in need and also supply our partner organisations who need our fresh produce. We are now collecting from even more supermarkets  allotments and farms. More outlets are coming online in next few weeks. The shop allows us to distribute not only residual food but also offer chilled and frozen food. Partner organisations are now working with us and will be taking space in store to signpost and help those needing more care and referral to statutory authorities. Financial support and sponsorship Moving into a retail premises has now incurred us some long-term financial liabilities and we need to reach out for help What we are fundraising for This includes building  building refurb  building future repairs  liability and building insurance  equipment and software  electricity and utilities  print and collateral . Website and internet/email. In addition  in order to supplement our residual food collections  we need to purchase extra food and products we don't get from supermarkets. This is purchased from Fareshare and other sources We started with a zero funding stream. We have managed to secure some small grants and donations from friendly benefactors which has allowed us to deliver to the stage we are now . We now need to fundraise to be able to grow and continue to deliver services. If residents and businesses are able to help we would be grateful To run this service effectively we need town centre warehouse and /retail premises ",False

We are so excited about the prospect of bringing this old Grade II listed building back to life! It was originally built in the early 1900’s as a Temperance Hall  since then it has had a plethora of uses  most recent of which left the building in a semi-derelict condition which included severe fire damage.    However  following its acquisition by The Tab Church  fresh ideas began to surface as to how it might be rescued  restored  and adapted to suit the needs for modern usage as Church  Community and Conferencing facility.    The ‘Tab1Milli’ is what will enable this most significant part of the Big Build project vision to become a reality  and the building actually able to be used.    But we can’t pull this off without your generous support because this is the largest financial project The Tab has ever undertaken.    We are therefore asking you to join with us through radical generosity  as together we step out in faith towards hitting the £1Million target by continually bringing our financial gifts together now and over the coming weeks and months.    Once the entire building is renovated  it will enable The Tab to continue and expand its traditional church functions and community initiatives  which are not limited to but currently include:  · Sunday services  · Kids church for children  · Crèche during the Sunday services  · Weekly prayer meetings  · Christian education and classes  · Administrative offices  · Bookshop/resources  · Food Bank – hosting Lewisham Central’s foodbank and distribution point. This is currently offered two-three times a week  staffed by 8-12 volunteers.  · Youth mentoring – support for vulnerable young people in the local community.  · Community action team (Restoration Empowerment and Community Help) – which focuses its support and resources on three vulnerable groups in Lewisham:  The elderly (offering days out and grocery food supplies);  The homeless (offering food clothing to those living on the streets)  and  Women and children escaping from domestic abuse (offering support).    *The Big Build Project includes the overall vision of Tabernacle Global Ministries and therefore maybe used for general purposes....",False

We have been operating since 2012 in London and became a charity in March 2020. Information about SWAN can be found on our website www.swanlondon.org. We run a foodbank and provide community support to many Refugee and migrant families in London. We have also been providing aid to refugees in Camp Moria since 2018 in partnership with Kitrinos Healthcare and Team Humanity who are both charities registered to work in Greece. We have collected  sent (via container) and provided vital humanitarian aid to Refugees in Moria camp including food parcels  baby milk  nappies  clothes  shoes and blankets and documented the distributions on social media (WhatsApp). Team Humanity are our implementing partner on the ground and they have distributed regular food parcels to new arrivals on our behalf. In recent months there has been a dramatic increase in the number of new arrivals and conditions are horrendous. Many families are living in inhumane conditions with little or new food. Since November 2019 SWAN - with the help of TEAM HUMANITY has been providing bread (which is prepared by Refugees) in the camp to starving refugees in and outside Moria Camp. The cost of preparing each bread is 40 cents. €400 provides 1000 breads. There are currently 21 000+ refugees in Moria and many new arrivals have no funds and the queues are so long for the food provided by the Greek authorities and local charities that many get nothing. All funds received for this campaign will be sent to our implementing partner Team Humanity to pay for preparation and distribution of the bread. The ground team send pictures of each distribution to SWAN which we share with donors for transparency. The bread we distribute is often all they will eat. SWAN aim to provide bread three times a week - £1200. If we could do more we would. But we are a small charity dependent on your support. Please give generously and help us  help and feed them.",False

As a result of the partnerships which have been made we have been able to supply food parcels for up to 100 families a week at times  this does not account for the number of people who come to collect food items at the church and these are separate to the Foodbank referrals. The contacts for the food parcels have come through various schools  individuals and other groups. We have also arranged the purchase and packing of around 50 fresh fruit and vegetable parcels for the local food bank each week. Since the start of Covid we have produced over 1250 food parcels between the Wokingham Community Hub  the Foodbank and direct contacts.    The majority of the items we have are donated however with the financial donations we receive we are able to put this back into the project and purchase items that we require. Share- Wokingham has been open daily to anyone who can come along to Norreys Church  offering bakery items and any other surplus food stock we have – there is no charge for this but if people are able to make a donation  however small  it is always appreciated. This means it does not carry the stigma attached to going to the Foodbank as people are not just being able to feed themselves for little to no money but they are also having an environmental impact in tackling the waste issue.    As the pandemic has continued the needs of those that we support have changed  initially it was people who were shielding and unable to get out and now we are really seeing the economic impact  job losses and financial woes have meant that people are struggling - that is where we can support.",False

Designed to look like miniature highly detailed East London style stores complete with lights  to be placed on a selection of fences in Waltham Forest.       The Artist Sean Rodrigo has previously decorated a Tiny Street Library in Walthamstow as a hand painted Edwardian home  and also completed a community project called The Mini Morris Project connecting the children of E17 with 500 free paintable hand-cast plaster sculpture kits of William Morris.     The boxes will serve as a donation point for canned food  where members can donate or talk cans from the box when they need it  and also for the food bank charity to pickup when the boxes are full.

Providing a free meal and friendly environment for the elderly people in need & homeless in east London. They offer weekly fresh quality foodbank sessions for shopping for families and individuals.

In Pakistan  approximately 53 000 children die consequential to waterborne diseases from consuming contaminated water. Water filtration plants work via a complex technology incorporating chemical  biological  physical processes to eliminate toxins and pollutants infecting water. One filtration plant will cost approx £2000  hence due to financial restraints there is often a struggle to implement them on a wider scale in Pakistan. At this moment  our current funds can only stretch to provide for one water filtration plant  which we are in the process of building. This will be located at a mosque so that those in it’s close proximity may enjoy the basic necessity and gift of water. We aim to attend to those in dire need and inshallah with the help of your donations we intend to increase our production and build two more water filtration plants so more communities may quench their thirst with water that won’t kill them. Our goal will be £4000  to be realistic  so to build two filtration plants that will provide to large and suffering communities. If we exceed this amount we can build more inshallah! This Ramadan  your donation could help gift not only water to an entire community but a sustainable system of access to water. Which would mean that a continual amount of clean water can be supplied to local residents for generations to come.Donations can be made in your name  a loved ones name or as sadaqa jariya for one who is no longer with us. On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him)  who said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Allah SWT will say on the Day of Resurrection:“O son of Adam  I asked you to give Me to drink and you gave Me not to drink. He will say: O Lord  how should I give You to drink when You are the Lord of the worlds? He will say: My servant So-and-so asked you to give him to drink and you gave him not to drink. Had you given him to drink you would have surely found that with Me.” Our brothers and sisters need us...let us fulfil our duties as an ummah. Not to mention increase our rewards and our station in the sight of Allah Azzawajal.May Allah reward us all for our efforts! ",False

That’s one food parcel every 13 seconds  and 2 600 of these went to children every day on average.  I decided to walk 2021 km & hopefully get this achieved within 10 months. So if you see me walking please give me a cheer and some motivational comments.   So I'm looking for your support Every penny helps put food on the table and allowing families to try not stress financially or have to choose between food and heating .So please consider donating to my sponsorship link below     TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE",True

My name is Hope and I have been a Hackney resident for almost six years. I feel very fortunate to live in such a brilliant area  and want to give something back.    Covid-19 has unfortunately left many in crisis  and the need for support from the community has been higher than ever.     In 2020  Hackney Foodbank reported that 19 400 households needed their support. This is a 263% increase from 2018.     The Government are currently offering an uplift in Universal Credit of £20 per week. However  they plan to stop this at the end of March. This has the potential to drive a further one million people to foodbanks across the UK.    Like everyone else  the majority of my last year has been spent on daily walks - now I want to make those steps count.     To raise money for my local foodbank  and awareness of the upcoming cuts in Universal Credit  I will be walking  running and cycling 20km a day for 20 days starting on Friday 25th March. This works out as 400km in distance  or around 4.5hours of walking a day.    My target is £400  £1 per km and I would love for you to sponsor me!     Any amount will be appreciated  even £5 will go a long way to making a difference in someone's life!     Thank you!",False

Due to Covid-19 and also  other unfortunate circumstances.    I made a generous donation myself  as I   remembered how it felt to have nothing  and itreminded me. Of that warm feeling I felt when  someone turnt up with a few bags of food and gifts for my children. It tied me over and took abig weight off of my shoulders. I was so so   Grateful and remember going to sleep that  night  thinking... I will be in a position one day  to give back. All this made me think of ways I could further help and that’s why I am setting up this page. In hope that you could Help  keep this  Amazing circle of giving.. go on for as long as   possible.   There is only so much that these Girls can do   and rely heavily on Donations. To be able to   continue this amazing work. Home from home  was created by 4 normal   mums and a dad who have all struggled due to COVID 19.   The group was made to offer help after they  found  that when they were at their lowest  points they were unsure of where to turn.    The kind of help someone needs when having  to Sheild and Self-Isolate. Would mean   someone else would have to shop for them    How can you ask for that kind of help when   your families are having to shield from each   other  or you are the only adult in your  household.     Good people who put into our community.  Have lost their jobs or can not work due to   this Pandemic or have been furloughed  are   now struggling.    In ways they never have before!     No help or support with benefit’s and the   constant stress of having to provide your   family with their basic needs.     Families on benefits that are now having to   collect minimal parcels of food from schools   and they simply cannot make ends meet.   This group just wants to take the weight off of everyone’s shoulders.     They’re friendly  confidential and non   judgemental. Our mental health at the  moment needs nurturing and nobody should   struggle. So they are also offering to listen andhelp  in any way they can. They recently helped make a little boys   birthday special. They have created their own foodbank and   take it in turns keeping up with maintenance.  Are very efficient with deliveries also.    This fund is being created to simply help    anyone who reaches out or is recommended   to them. They on average  so far are helping  8-16 families a day. With each average family   parcel. Costing around £40. They are  collecting Donations and dropping them from Canvey  Benfleet  Hadleigh  Wickford  pitsea  Basildon and surrounding areas. All from their own pockets and kind  gestures from the community  but this is not   enough anymore. With the Increasing demand Lets all come together and help in any which   way we can  to make people Smile again and  no matter how big or small  your donation will mean The World  to many and keep this group  going for as long as possible.

Free Meals  Full Hearts is designed to bridge that gap and ensure that if your situations changes quickly  or you just need a little help - we're here for you. Anonymously.    I have heard some truly eye opening stories since creating this charitable group - everything from families only eating one meal a day and a couple who hadn't had a hot meal in days to another family who had literally only eaten canned beans and hoops for 10 days solidly because their weekly food budget was £9 to feed 5. It really does put life in perspective.    No-one in our community should go hungry. Ever.    The Reading community has shown time and time again that when faced with challenges or adversities  we come together. The camaraderie  generosity and positivity around us every day is overwhelming.    Feeding yourself and your family is a basic but essential human necessity but unfortunately far too many people in the Reading area are skipping meals and going hungry because they simply can't afford to eat. I can only imagine this must be particularly heartbreaking if you're a parent who is unable to feed your children. As momentum has increased and more and more people have heard about Free Meals  Full Hearts and we occasionally find ourselves struggling to help due to lack of physical food donations. When this happens  I either dip into the reserve pot or sometimes  out of my own pocket i'll buy emergency food shops for families (between £30-£50 per week depending on the size of the family). I have also ordered last minute takeaways for families and bought other essential items such as medical prescriptions and personal hygiene and cleaning products    'Free Meal  Full Hearts' is a anonymous platform where people (single  couples or families) can reach out and ask for food should they need to  without judgement.    If you are able to help  please do. It's massively appreciated - not just by me  but by every family who are committed to helping    Thank You    Newpaper Article",False

The blasts in Beirut  were pretty devastating  but the important news in all this was that more than 6 000 people were injured  plus 150 killed  dozens still missing to this hour as rescue teams search for them  & hundreds of homes & people’s livelihoods were shattered  rendering nearly 3000 homeless.     As a result  Beirut has been declared a disaster striken city.     With the port -- Lebanon's economical lifeline -- totally destroyed   food shortages will spike & many families will go without.Already  Lebanon was suffering from massive food & fuel shortages  and now it will not be able to import anything. Bleak  darker days for hundreds of thousands of people lie ahead!     This is urgent.     Lebanon needs you now.    Please donate so we can ensure people have a place to stay safe  food to eat & the means to survive & overcome this catastrophe.    Pray for lebanon ...    Your help is more needed than ever     Your donations will help contribute to:    -hospital bills  -small repairs  -Buy basic food items to put together food parcels for many who will have nothing to eat today and in many more days to come.   -Life saving medications for those in need & unable to afford those.We need to help those on the ground with whatever means we can.    Help us help people   we beg you!         ___________________________________      Half the population are living in abject poverty.     People are dying  not from Covid  but from starvation  lack of medication and healthcare.    The economy  currency and banking system have failed. Inflation has been the final blow. Many in work have not been paid for months and others have lost their job and cannot feed their families or pay the rent.     Callers from across Lebanon have been begging for help on the programme “Sahtak Bill Dinyeh ” (your health is worth the world) on Sawt al Ghad radio .    Helped by many charitable people  the programme’s host Dory Nasr has distributed food  medicine and basic necessities.        Now the warehouse is empty.      Lebanese around the world and those sympathetic to the country’s plight can help by donating what they can. Every penny helps  paying for baby milk  food  medicine and housing.    Hala and Dana  two British-Lebanese expats  decided to kickstart this fundraiser to help secure both continuity and replenishment of the food bank. This is a much needed lifeline  without which many families will be doomed with both hunger and displacement.       Le Liban est au bord de l’effondrement total.    La moitié de la population vit dans une pauvreté extrême.    Les gens meurent  non pas de Covid  mais de faim  de manque de médicaments et de soins de santé.    L'économie  la monnaie et le système bancaire ont échoué. L'inflation a été le coup de grâce. Beaucoup d’employés n'ont pas reçu leurs salaires depuis des mois et d'autres ont perdu leur emploi et ne peuvent plus nourrir leurs familles  payer le loyer ou acheter des medicaments vitaux.    Les appelants de part et d’autre du Liban ont imploré l'aide sur l'émission «Sahtak Bill Dinyeh» (votre santé vaut le monde) sur la radio Sawt al Ghad .    Avec l’aide de nombreuses personnes charitables  l’animateur du programme  Dori Nasr  a distribué de la nourriture  des médicaments et des produits de première nécessité.

Since we were founded 10 months ago  we have continued to support local schools and their families with vital food packages. This is something that is really important to us as we have come to realise how many people are struggling in the county and have been shocked by it. We have built a fantastic relationship with local schools and knowing we are doing something for these young people and their families is very rewarding. As well as schools we have provided food packages to the Northamptonshire community mental health team  'leaving care': an organisation for individuals who are leaving the care system  HM probation services  local community groups as well as many families or vulnerable individuals who have reached out for support.     The McCarthy-Dixon foundation started initially as an emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a food bank and food delivery service. We have quickly broadened our services after realising the scope of both poverty and hardship in the local area. The community has always been at the heart of what we do and this means we will change and adapt to what the community needs.",False

Update: 19th January  2021 I've been interviewed by The Independent about the catastrophic consequences of the upcoming Universal Credit cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/b1789040.html      .  .  .        My original message: 30th August  2019    This is incredibly difficult for me to write  but I need to ask my friends  acquaintances and perhaps even some people whom I don’t know  to help me get through the next few months.    I am a domestic abusive survivor struggling to meet essential living costs and the situation is going to escalate rapidly because my employer is deducting more than 25% of my pay from September onwards  to recover two overpayments they made in error for a really long time  without me or payroll noticing.    I’m already on a low income and have been trying to find a more stable job. Until now I’ve been working two jobs  but the temporary one is coming to an end and I will only have my permanent part-time job – where they have persistently tried to dismiss me on health grounds so aside from the overpayment recovery  I just can’t hold on there for much longer.    Whenever I do give my notice or get dismissed  they’ll take the entirety of my final month’s pay.    I live alone but the person I used to cohabit with left substantial utility bill debts at our home that I didn’t become aware of until later  since they lied about having cleared balances. There’s not enough space to move another person in  and I can’t move out right now for financial and contractual reasons.    Because of an active police investigation for rape and domestic abuse that I can’t go into  I’ve already borrowed money for unexpected costs like home security  numerous phone calls to charities and agencies offering professional advice  and private therapy which unfortunately I had to quit.    My chronically poor health has dramatically worsened – I’ve been to a&e twice in the past fortnight because of a kidney infection that didn’t respond to treatment and I had to pawn things to pay for my ongoing prescriptions  but there’s not much of value left for me to sell.    I need to wear glasses but have been doing without for several months since they broke; I’m doing without a lot of things. One of my cats needs dental surgery soon but this isn’t going to be possible.    I earn slightly too much to claim benefits or get free prescriptions and despite years of hospital referrals  I am still fighting for a diagnosis to explain my physical health problems so I’m not currently eligible for any support that could be claimed.    Unfortunately I’m estranged from my parents and I don’t have regular contact with any other family.    I don’t have savings and I wouldn’t realistically be able to repay any further money borrowed.    Up to this point I’ve managed to keep on top of the rent and buy cat food but I have now begun going without my own food  even before overpayment recovery has started. I’m hoping to access a food bank next week but the period I can use them for will be limited.    It’s hard to put a figure on how much help I should ask for  since the only real solution is me finding a job where they’re not actively trying to dismiss me for my chronic health problems  but I am hopeful that if I can just get straight with the money I already owe and raise a couple of months’ living expenses to buy myself time whilst finding a better job  then I can make things work.    Thank you for reading this far; I am extremely grateful to anyone who can donate or share this page. I don’t have many followers and would really appreciate people making this fundraiser more visible. ",False

We currently support families within the BS2 and surrounding areas  100% of your donations helps us maintain our resources to provide a varied weekly package.     Job security is becoming less stable as the furlough scheme tapers out  gig economy workers can find less work and self employed people are also facing uncertainty  there is still a further need to do more and support people at this time.

I’m asking for help because  like so many people at the moment  Covid 19 and lockdown has financially defeated me. I started studying for my makeup artistry qualification during the first lockdown  and I am ready to begin my career in this field... but unfortunately  I am unable to raise the funds for my stock  insurance and even a car (which has died a death during lockdown) because I’ve been unable to work. I’m a mum of two and have been studying and homeschooling for almost a year now!   To put it bluntly  my kids and I don’t know how we’ve managed. I’ve been collecting food bank parcels  had family help me out with groceries and I’ve even had to let a few monthly bills go into arrears for a month or two because it was a choice between the bills and food. I cut down on the unnecessary bills as soon as lockdown hit us the first time  but it’s merely offered the ability to get a little more food in. It’s taken a lot of courage to admit that... not many people around me have known how bad it has been at times in my house     Makeup  for me  is about freedom of expression. It is about treating a face as a beautiful blank canvas with same scope for creativity.     Any face can be transformed by the application of makeup. It can be transformed  enhanced... and for some  improved. People use makeup for all manner of reasons; some wear it to make them feel more attractive  some wear it to feel empowered  ready to take on the day... a kind of war paint so to speak... some wear it simply for a level of personal enjoyment and creative freedom it offers... not to mention fun!!     For me  to do makeup on someone else’s beautiful face  the pleasure of seeing them feel transformed  beautiful and ready for any occasion is the most satisfaction one can experience. To take the stress of having to do yet another task for a bride on her big day  to pamper someone getting ready for going out to celebrate their birthday/anniversary anything... and see their happiness is so rewarding!     When I create looks on myself  I get to satisfy the artist in me. I can create literal art on my face and feel beautiful and confident all at once!! The level of freedom is immeasurable because there are simply no limits. And there is no greater fun in that kind of freedom.    I appreciate any support I may receive through this  it has taken a lot of courage tocreate this account  so any help will be greatly appreciated beyond words!! I only started exploring makeup properly during the first lockdown to help me stay focused  motivated and boredom free... and found myself better than I ever expected! I enrolled with Girl Meets Brush Academy and started entering challenges they posted and entered a competition last summer. I won a number of the individual challenges and was awarded the Highly Commended award and also was named one of the winners in the big competition held in August. The prize was to have a homemade video of a makeup creation showcased in the Digital London Fashion Week!! To win such a dream competition as that in such a short space of time gave me the encouragement and confidence to continue this career. My work is unique  my looks are innovative... and my passion is unmeasurable!! To say I love what I do is a severe understatement!!! ",False

The Project /Building Purley Masjid​    Purley Masjid is a modern Islamic community centre in a suburb of South London  Purley. It was established in 2015 after fund raising to accommodate the needs of the local Muslim community.    Ma Sha’ Allah  the Masjid is now trying to cope with the demand and has to overcome many challenges to support the Muslim and also non-Muslim community. Here are just a few of examples of the issues:     We have one main hall which accommodates only 200 people for an average Jumu’ah congregation of over 400.      People often have to wait outside in the forecourt for the second Jamaat     Current facilities for ladies accommodates around 30  whereas the demand is known to be in excess of 150. This is severely restricting our ability to meet current demand for women     Our lectures  Fitness Classes  Mother and Toddlers group  daily iftaris in Ramadhan and seniors meet up sessions all take place on the same carpeted area on which we pray. This is not ideal and as we are effectively operating out of one hall  it means that we can only have one activity happening at any given time     The Food Bank only has enough space for a shelf rack to store food. It caters for anyone in need in the Purley community  Muslim and non-Muslim alike        By the Grace of Allah swt we have embarked on the Building Purley Masjid project that will cater for the needs of the community. The project will result in a new Masjid on the current Purley Masjid site and will be a modern  purpose built building for the community spanning 6 floors that will include:     Two male prayer halls with a combined capacity of 500     A ladies prayer hall with capacity of over 200 and crèche facilities      A multi purpose hall     A dedicated lecture/events hall (we held over 100 last year)  which can accommodate 100 people     Improved facilities for our already existing Youth Activities  Mother and Toddlers Group and Seniors Group     Separate classrooms for our Madrasah classes      More space for our weekly Food Bank  ​​    We already have all these activities running at Purley Masjid but are struggling to meet demands and keep up the excellent level of service we provide.",False

I had realised that as a semi-retired person I was pretty much 'alright Jack' under lockdown and wondered if I could do anything to help others. My first idea  on 20 May  had been to go to NHS Strathbrock and play for the amusement of staff and patients. That day I also put my busking hat down with a sign saying ""all proceeds to...."" After securing permission from the police  I decided to put the hat back on my head and start my ""pipe-walks"" around Kirkhill and West End  intending to return to the Strathbrock  of course  and at least three facilities for older residents near me.

Many people have lost their jobs because of the virus  there has been a surge in the number of people becoming homeless and without food.    Being the community school we are  its only right that we are at the forefront of ‘building our community for our community’ we are doing this by setting up a food bank to provide food and essential items for our most vulnerable young people and families within our school and wider community.

Our plan is to have a refill shop run by the community and by people who have special education needs.       The refill shop will be run as a community interest company to keep the food prices competitive with local supermarkets  which would mean everyone can afford to shop plastic free helping the environment.        All money that is not put back into the buisness will go to local and environment causes.       We will also have a recycling center in our courtyard for everything that cannot go in the local grey bins.       Working with local organisations and supporting the Rutland Food Bank by taking donations at the shop and donating things that are coming to the end of their sell by dates.   We really need your help and support to set this up and are asking for donations to help start our new and exciting community project. Any donation big or small will be very much appreciated.   Also if companies would like to donate we will put a small thank you sticker with their logo onto what we bought with their money (this will most lightly be a food storage box or storage tube).   If you think you could help in any other way please contact us. We need people to help set up the shop i.e. - help with fitting  painting  decorating etc. Also help with running the shop like book keeping  restocking  ordering  working on the shop floor.

We fund locally owned cafes and restaurants to provide families most in need with a good meal. By doing this we are not only providing urgent support to desperate families but also supporting businesses most affected by the COVID pandemic.     Due to COVID people are losing their jobs  businesses are closing and there has been a significant increase in food poverty in the UK. Families are sacrificing food to pay their bills. The Trussell Trust have predicted that there will be a 61% increase in food bank use alone this winter and this doesn't even consider the social impact of poverty on children and families.     Every penny raised will go directly to feeding families with meals provided by local businesses. We have no overheads during the trial phase so everything you donate will go directly to providing food to families and children in real need of a meal. The trial phase will begin as soon as we can feed one family and we hope  with your support  to feed 100!     For just £5 you can feed a child a two course meal in a warm  welcoming environment. For another £5 you can feed their brother or sister a further £7  their parent(s) too. Please help us to provide these children and their families with food and human connection during these trying times.     Your donation will help us add to the growing network of food aid in the UK  help us do what the government can't and work towards ending hunger poverty!

If you’re in a position to financially support our Food Bank at The Ark  it would be greatly appreciated. We will use your donation to help those who require help and/or support.     At The ARK  we are committed to providing free wholesome home-cooked food for a cross range of families  the elderly  the vulnerable  students  and single people regardless of gender  ethnicity  and age. We also provide a food parcel for school children during the holidays and when it is needed.    The aim of raising funds is also to enable us to provide community-based projects to enable the elderly to engage together meeting their needs for social & personal interaction  in turn hoping to stem the gap of social isolation. We would like to purchase a delivery van to help our volunteers to be able to collect and deliver food donations and parcels.    At the beginning of this current pandemic  we saw the need to provide food  toiletries  and home essential parcels to assist all those who were on furlough and/or were struggling financially. We have delivered meal service to people currently on our books & those that are referred to us from external sources. All food donated are most definitely put to good use in our food parcels  which is a much-needed service and one we are hoping to continue long after the disappearance of the pandemic.    Our main focus is reaching into the community and meeting their current needs and offering hope. Since April 2020 we have delivered over 500 individual food parcels to a wide range of people and organizations within Nottingham.

However  our main focus will always be the local food-bank  which is located in the community centre and making sure that we are able to sustain it to a level that will allow us to support families in the community when they need it most     As always running a community group requires funding and we have been so lucky that due to the generosity of local businesses and people that we have been able to sustain what we started back in March 2020 and we want to be in a position to continue offering support for as long as it is needed.     Therefore we have set up this fundraising page to support all our activities and again would be entirely grateful for any donations received     Stay Safe ",False

I am 14 and I am looking to give back to my local community via the Food Bank.     Lockdown saw many people struggle and find themselves in need of help. One of the many charities who gave support through lockdown were the Food Banks.   From April 2019- March 2020  1.9 million food parcels were given to people in need.   From April 2020- September 2020 that number had already been beaten  with 1 239 399 emergency food parcels given.   (Statistics from the Trussell Trust website.)    The Trussell Trust are a charity who strive to ‘stop UK hunger’. They support a nationwide network of food banks and provide emergency food and support to people locked in poverty. They also campaign for change to end the need for food banks in the UK.   There are various ways of helping the food banks  from donating food  volunteering your time  direct donations or fundraising like me. If you would like to donate to the Trussell Trust directly  please visit their website at trusselltrust.org     I would like to give directly to my local food bank as they have given help and support to my own family when we have needed it.     Over the Easter Holidays I began to walk  run and jog a planned course to the top of Mount Everest. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to climb the real Mount Everest! But with the help of an app called The Conqueror  I was able to follow the 40 mile route that is usually taken by hikers  and map my progress. I added updates that detail the journey and there’s plenty of photos to check out. The app that I am using also plants a tree on my behalf every time I reach the next 20% marker  which means that you and I are not only helping the local Food Bank  but also our planet.     The profits raised after my challenge were spent purchasing items that the food bank can use to build food packages for families in my area. I used a local supermarket to get the best possible prices and actually shopped myself! Yes who knew that a 14 year old boy would voluntarily go food shopping!   Along the way I also learnt about period poverty in low income families  so I also brought sanitary products as the food bank also distribute toiletries.     This challenge was so successful  so I will continue to do these challenges and raise as much money as I can in aid of the food bank. Many people still rely on a weekly food parcel and therefore food banks will continue to need our support. I have so far completed the Mount Everest and Giza Pyramids challenges and my next virtual journey is going to be Mount Fuji. There is loads of information and photos about each trek on the updates tab so please check them out.     If you would like to donate to my cause  I would be very grateful.    I was looking online for a quote to finish off with and found one I liked by Helen Keller....    “Alone  we can do so little;   Together  we can do so much. “       ",False

Your donations will go towards our Brent community food bank for the homeless  those in need for whatever reason  and the elderly in the community especially during the pandemic. Members from our community attend every Wednesday between 6.30-7.30pm at The Lewinson Centre 165-167 High Road Willesden NW10 (opposite Savers) and benefit from getting  free of charge  a whole range of food  and other items like toiletries and clothes if available. How We Began On the 1st April 2020 the Agape Ministry Food Bank was birthed we were responding to the obviously need in our Community in Brent caused by this dreadful Coronavirus pandemic. There were three volunteer workers: Amie Alexis  Sis Madge Facey and myself  Felicia Alexis. We had one box  which was by no means full  and a desire to minister to the church and the community. That day we distributed 9 bags.   In the weeks that followed we have seen God move in an amazing way. Members and friends of the Church rose to the challenge  they donated money on-line and donated food items to the Ministry over and over again. I have to pause here to say ‘thank you’ for your generosity. Heaven knows how many people you have impacted in a positive way. I would like to acknowledge not only those who have given  but to those who have prayed or volunteered their time in anyway as well. We are workers together with God and we are all doing our bit.   Some people will bring in one or two items some  several bags full. Nothing is too small or too big  all is received gratefully. From time to time we will receive surprise donations from the local butchers  restaurants  green grocers and even a school. Now we are into a new year still facing the pandemic and we are ministering to more and more people in the community. We see people every week from all different nationalities. Besides offering food we provide a safe place where people can come and feel the presence of God and find hope in a hopeless world. No one is rejected  everyone is accepted. Every week we provide tea  coffee  biscuits and cake for those coming in. Besides food  people are now looking for nappies  washing powder  readymade meals and even a vacuum cleaner. Our Faithful Volunteers I would like to mention the faithful volunteers that work with  me week after week. Sis Madge Facey  Sis Janet Ashman  Sis Fay Scott and my faithful husband Joseph Alexis. Bro Anthony Manning who sets a worshipful atmosphere with live music and Bro David Oram who comes every other week with his Healing banner and offers prayers for anyone who asks. I also would like to mention Bro Tim Stewart  who gets roped into helping me anytime he turns up and Sis Denice Denton who is there whenever she can be. We also have a young lady who lives in the community who has recently volunteered some of her time  to helping us with the ministry.   As we begin 2021 we will be inviting business people to partner with us by donating £100.00 for one month. In return the team will pray faithfully for the success of that business for the whole of that month and we will promote it. Joseph Alexis is the first ‘volunteer’ and his business is called Sixela Ltd  he provides a handyman services. He can be contacted on Telephone No. 07[phone redacted]93.   The Agape Ministry is growing and we are expecting to see increase this year both in numbers and in our sphere of influence. May God bless you all as we use every opportunity that we have to let our light shine before men that they may see our good works and come to glorify our Father who is in heaven.

As a Christian place of worship  Sussex Street Christian Centre (formerly Sussex Street Baptist Church) has been in the centre of Rhyl since 1863  when the English Baptist church was built for the English speaking people coming into Wales to work  and who wanted a place to worship God. We are a bilingual Church.    The building is beautiful  is Grade 2 listed  meaning all work must be approved and overseen by CADW.  Regeneration is also coming to Sussex Street generally  with the demolition and refurbishment of the Queen’s Market.    As with other organisations in Rhyl  and UK generally  our congregation is heavily involved in Food Bank and Fare Share. Up to end September 2020 we had helped nearly 5000 people in these ways  in 1 year. Coronavirus has made us extremely busy; however  we enjoy helping our local community  and ensure our clients are in touch with an agency who can help them.    In the past 157 years  we have served the community in many and varied ways.    In the early 1900s afternoon teas  for ladies and gentlemen  were served  on different days.    We have sought to take a great interest in the young people of our town  holding Venturers and Boys Brigade meetings  plus girl Guides and Brownie groups in the past.   As well as mixed meetings we have groups for ladies  men  and children  so that all feel included. In fact  children between ages 4 and 18 receive Christian teaching in a fun  challenging  but empowering way.     As needs have changed in our community  members of our congregation have been involved in our local schools doing after school Club meetings  also taking some morning assemblies at the Headteacher’s request. This is a UK – wide venture  Open the Book  which many children and teachers have said they value because it helps them.     As stated  our building is 157 years old and the upkeep of it can be  and is  a big strain on our resources. When we discovered our roof needed urgent attention with Welsh slate tiles having to be used  we came up with the idea of crowd funding. The amount we are hoping to raise over the next year is approx. £30 000 to £40 000. There are 3 separate roof areas needing attention; ideally all should be repaired and replaced. The sum for this is in excess of £100 000. We are currently fundraising; work is soon to start on the front. The remaining works can only be started as fundraising progresses.  Our Charity  Sussex Street Christian Centre is a Charity Incorporated Organisation (CIO)  so we are an independent charity.    To assist us yet further to serve the community  we have completely modernised our kitchen to provide lunches. One of our current aims is to provide lunches to those in need in Rhyl. The toilet area is now refurbished and is suitable for friends needing access with wheelchairs.     Our Minister is the Rev Trevor Casey and we have a board of Trustees who deal with the oversight and running of the Church building.  The age range of our congregation is 4yrs to 96 years.     There is an old Church in Rhyl    whose roof is no longer sealed   the seagulls there nested    bad weather regressed it   now old beams must make an appeal    From Diana  a Church member    https://www.christiancentre.info/    We need your help now please!",False
