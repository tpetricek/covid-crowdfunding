Having had a mental breakdown and suicide attempt I was struggling mentally and financially. I went to the food bank and while there I had a mini breakdown. This is when I met [Zink Advice Worker] Julie. Julie was extremely easy to talk to and quickly gained my trust to be able to talk to her. She helped me sort through piles of paperwork  speaking to people about bills and debts  getting me to speak to the right people to help me and being there when I just needed to talk. Since September I have been diagnosed with autism and the biggest problem I had was a debt to my landlord of over £4000 for which they had an eviction order. Julie was instrumental in helping me get a court hearing where the eviction was suspended. Julie's knowledge was brilliant and made we aware of funds/benefits available to me and because of this in under nine months I have been able to pay off (through myself and funds) the entire arrears and have the eviction set aside. For the first few months I was also reliant on the food bank side while my money git sorted.  I cannot thank Julie (and Zink and high peak food bank) enough for the last nine months. Without her and them I certainly wouldn't be in as good a position as I am now - mentally  financially and emotionally.   I want to give back and as I am not working I don't have the means to give what I want.   This is my thank you. Please help me so that they can continue to help people back on their feet the way they have helped me.   In addition to this I have had some lovely people on here and B and Q donate materials for making a mosaic and Buxton Woodwork  Buxton building supplies and Markovitz have all donated enough materials for me to make around six bird tables and several bird boxes. These will be being sold and auctioned off by Zink/food bank for some more money for them.   Thank you in advance as I say thanks to them",False

Its a form or autoimmune arthritis that has destroyed my body and left me disabled literally overnight. It continues to destroy my joints every day but thanks to medication it has been slowed down a bit. Then  last year  to make matters worse  I caught a form of coronovirus that put me in hospital for 2 months. I spent 3 weeks in a coma on a lung bypass machine. I very nearly died and at more than one occasion my wife was told to prepare for the worst and was told that I had about a 10% chance of survival. I lived but I have been left with severe lung damage. I have lost about 40% of my lung function and now require oxygen constantly.   So now I need a wheelchair to go anywhere that requires walking a distance and oxygen too.   I have been left with other side effects of the coronovirus and the arthritis causes a lot more issues than just my joints but it would take an age to list them all and describe them too so I will just say that I am f*#*Ed.   I have a wife  3 boys and a granddaughter and I'm only 45 so it's like my life has been taken away from me far too soon as I miss out on so much. I can't have a kick around with my son  I struggle with chess. I can't teach my youngest how to ride his bike. My life really sucks. Life on the pittance of benefits we get is terrible. Food banks help and there are many other groups out there that help out too but we never have any money to be able to have any decent standard of life. So please put your hand in your pocket and help me and my family out. Help me out so I can get a decent  working wheelchair. Help us out so that maybe we could have a dream family holiday. Help us out so we can get our house decorated. Jobs that I was going to do but now I can't. Help us out so we can get our garden sorted out. The list goes on and on of things I wanted to do but can't anymore. Please just help us out. ",True

Its a distance of 25 miles which will take me over Pen-y-ghent  Whernside and Ingleborough which are some rather big hills! The money I raise will be split evenly between the two charities and I am hoping to reach a target of 1000 which will hopefully go a long way in supporting people in need around Doncaster.       In 2019 I had been suffering with depression for a number of years but eventually sought professional help and it genuinely transformed my life and has given me a whole new outlook and purpose. I was fortunate to have the support of my family and friends when I truly needed it most. I was also able to pay for the help I needed  but not everyone is that lucky. That's why 50% of what we raise will go to MIND mental health charity  because they offer a free counselling service to people who need it most  who sometimes don't have that support bubble.   Doncaster Food Bank work tirelessly all year round and depend on the generosity of our community to do what they do. So I want to do my part to help as I don't believe anyone should go hungry or not be able to feed their families. Any of us could depend on a charity like this one day  you never know.    Any donation you can make would honestly be very appreciated.   Thank you! ",False

It’s crazy how the pandemic we currently living in has caused all kinds of financial difficulties situations and families have had no choice but to turn to the food banks for help and assistance. I know that raising money will help the food bank buy essential food. It saddens me to see how the numbers have doubled as more people are being impacted by COVID-19 with job losses and furlough leaving families struggling to find money to buy enough food. We have all seen the headlines regarding school meals but it's easy to forget for a lot of these children that is the only balanced meal they will get. In the first six months of the pandemic  some food banks in the United Kingdom gave out a staggering 1.2 million emergency food parcels. That’s one food parcel every 13 seconds  and 2 600 of these went to children every day on average. I decided to walk 2021 km and hopefully get this achieved within 10 months. So if you see me walking please give me a cheer and some motivational comments. Every penny helps put food on the table and allowing families to try not stress financially or have to choose between food and heating. So please consider donating to a worthy cause.    So I'm looking for your support. Together we can make a difference.  ",False

It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has launched to support our community and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.  The Lambeth Food Bank Fund   Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.   In Lambeth we have a history of looking after one another - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.   So we are creating something called the Lambeth Food Bank Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.   Our borough has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has been set up for us to help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.   Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Lambeth. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.     * * *   FAQs  What can I do?  Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the most vulnerable.   Where will the funds go?  The funds will go to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by Holy Trinity Clapham and delivered to food banks across the borough - including Brixton & Norwood  Clapham Park  Vauxhall  and Waterloo - that can help the most vulnerable.   If I do donate will it go to those who need it?   Yes  your donation will go to those who need it. Unlike other platforms  GoFundMe do not charge a fundraising fee although they take a small transaction fee. See here for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to.   I want to help my local community  will this money be spent in Lambeth?   Yes.   Where can I find accurate information about covid-19?   For general information on CV-19  please visit the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response  Lambeth Council have some useful information: https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/elections-and-council/about-lambeth/coronavirus-covid-19-information  If you are worried about your own health  call the NHS on 111.

Now  we need your support more than ever.    Due to massive demand and the end of the lease on our current Warehouse we are moving to a brand new home that will help us increase our capacity and speed up our operations  helping us to continue to put food donated by the community straight into the hands of those who need it.     This is an exciting chapter in Canterbury Food Bank’s history  and a brilliant opportunity for us to grow and change in response to new challenges. But it is also an expensive chapter; our previous premises were occupied on a peppercorn lease of £10 a month  so by paying the market rate for a suitable property our rental costs have been multiplied 133 times.     We are asking our community to help us raise a year of rent - £16 000 - up front so that all other funds can be used to buy and deliver food. Please donate and share this appeal widely to secure the future of the Food Bank as a key charity in the district.     PRESS RELEASE -    Canterbury Food Bank today launched a campaign to help pay for its new building - after its rent multiplied 133 times.     The charity is moving to another warehouse  specially converted to suit its needs  because the lease on its current premises has come to an end.    CFB had been paying a peppercorn rent of £10 a month for the old building  but will now have to pay market rate of £16 000 a year.     Its Raise the Rent campaign aims to cover the rental costs so that all other funds can be used to buy and deliver food. The new  bigger warehouse  near Whitstable  secures the future of CFB as a key charity in the district.     Demand in the past 12 months has at times more than trebled year-on-year and in December it provided enough food to make more than 10 000 meals.     The economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 crisis  and the uncertainty of Brexit  are the main reasons behind the spike.    The charity has signed a five-year lease on the 3 780 square foot  two storey warehouse  which will be used to store donations of food and as an office.     CFB chair Martin Ward said: “We’re pleased and relieved to have secured our long-term future at a time when our services have never seen such high demand.     “It has become clear over the past year that  even more than ever  a backstop is needed to help those who can not afford food.     “We are that backstop and it is our intention to remain so for as long as we are required.     “These are difficult times for many people and we ask the public to help us support those most in need.”    CFB provides emergency three-day food parcels to individuals and families in financial need across Canterbury  Whitstable  Herne Bay and surrounding villages.    It has donation baskets in all leading supermarkets including Sainsbury’s  Tesco  Asda and Morrisons  where people can leave dried or tinned food items. ",False

Embarrased and even ashamed  but even more desperate and distraught that their kids are going hungry  mums tell us that they can go days without food  and  on average  it takes people at least a week of going hungry before they finally come through our doors and ask for help.

A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems. Barrow Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. There has never been a more crucial time to help those who are less fortunate than us - which is why I have organised this event.     The Covid-19 effect   Well before Covid-19 hit the UK  food banks in the Trussell Trust network had been seeing year-on-year increases in levels of need  with 1.9 million emergency food parcels given out in 2019/20. As Covid-19 hit the UK  the Trussell Trust saw an immediate and sustained surge in need across its food banks. In April there was an 89% increase in the number of emergency food parcels given out compared with the same month in 2019. This included a 107% increase in the number of parcels given to children  compared to the same period last year. New findings show that almost 100 000 households received support from a food bank in the Trussell Trust network for the very first time between April and June 2020. It's no secret that the pandemic has had a significant impact on people's jobs and finances - increasing the use of foodbanks nationwide.     What are we doing?   Since March 2020  many people (including myself) have adopted a new hobby in running. Whether it is to pass time  get out of the house  keep fit whilst the gyms are closed or a tool to manage your mental health. Everyone has their individual reasons for running and it would be fantastic to use this as an opportunity to help and support our local foodbank through completing a half marathon challenge (13.1 miles or 21.09 kilometres).     When?  Those who are taking part will complete the run on either Friday 23rd April  Saturday 24th April or Sunday 25th April - uploading their run to the page when complete.     Donations  There is a group target amount of £1 000 and every penny donated is hugely appreciated. However  I am conscious of the financial difficulties that many people face due to the current situation  therefore  it is absolutely fine if you are unable to donate - you can always share this page instead!

Many individuals and families have suffered additional hardship during this period and demand for foodbank services has increased significantly over this time and continues to rise. The ending of the furlough scheme at the end of October is likely to result in this demand increasing further as more people are unfortunately likely to be made redundant.    The foodbank at Danebury Drive has been run since the start of lockdown by one individual from her own front garden. Initially this was on a small scale helping a number of local families  but has grown significantly to the point where currently 50 food parcels are produced weekly with an addition 75 individuals access the food on offer for collection for themselves and families.    As a result  the foodbank has become a valuable resource for families on the North and East sides of Acomb. This is one of a network of community foodbanks set up across the city who are all working together to share resources best they can.    The onset of winter means that to continue premises need to found as running this outside with no cover will no longer be viable. Premises have been found at a local church with the offer of a peppercorn rent. In addition to rent funding will be required to cover rent and fuel costs    The foodbank currently receives a significant amount of food donations from Co-op  Fareshare and Morrisons amongst others which is mainly of items such as bread and non-perishable items. Whilst the support has been amazing  this rarely provides sufficient fresh items to support the need  hence the additional purchase of such items mentioned above. Clearly such nutritional items are required for an individual to have a balanced diet  made more important by the fact that many children are supported by the bank.    Up to date the £250pw for fresh items has been covered by a weekly £200pw purchase of produce by a local charity (Kitchen for Everyone York) with the additional made up by the small amount of monetary donations received at the foodbank. However  the current level of support from Kitchen for Everyone cannot be maintained and their support has dropped to £100pw due to a shortage of funding. This level of funding will be continued until the end of 2020.    The costs of powering the fridge freezers and fuel for collection has been borne by the individual running the bank  but this cannot be maintained.    Your help is requested to help continue the service that has been so invaluable for the local community  especially as there are concerns that demand is more likely to increase in the short term rather than decline.",False

Due to the pandemic  countless numbers of small and local businesses have been forced to close - with barbershops/hair salons being examples of the businesses that are suffering the most. Now  the normal response for the owner of a business like this would be to take advantage of rate relief  seek bridge funding for the business and also look for financial support being offered to people that are self-employed.    But not Ziggy...        Ziggy has converted the Barbershop into a Food Bank that is specifically focused on helping the elderly and other vulnerable members of the local community to have access to the food and sustenance they need in a time when it may be challenging to make trips to supermarkets or go shopping themselves.    We all know that local businesses like barbershops are massive pillars within communities as they are connected to so many people and aware of a range of local issues. So  who better and where better for a Food Bank to support vulnerable people to come from?        As it stands  Ziggy is not only travelling (on his own dime) to his shop  to the homes of people who cannot make it to his Food Bank and even spending his own money to buy food if he is short on donations from local people that are aware his Food Bank Exists. ALL WHILST HE IS LOSING MONEY AS HE CANNOT TRADE AND RUN HIS BUSINESS AS NORMAL.

The Artist Sean Rodrigo has previously decorated a Tiny Street Library in Walthamstow as a hand painted Edwardian home  and also completed a community project called The Mini Morris Project connecting the children of E17 with 500 free paintable hand-cast plaster sculpture kits of William Morris.     The boxes will serve as a donation point for canned food  where members can donate or talk cans from the box when they need it  and also for the food bank charity to pickup when the boxes are full.     Food banks are currently very busy as people are being hit hard by work instability caused by COVID 19. PL84U Al Suffa Food bank’s mission is to Serve the community of the Elderly  Homeless and those ‘In need’ people of faith and non-faith groups who are living in conditions of social-economic  cultural deprivation and isolation. Providing a free meal and friendly environment for the elderly people in need & homeless in east London. They offer weekly fresh quality foodbank sessions for shopping for families and individuals.    For more information or to donate directly please visit www.pl84u-alsuffa.org        We hope these boxes give people an approachable way to get food without the stigma of visiting a food bank and also as a way to enrich the streets with a beautiful new mini landmark.     The intention is to cover the cost of building the boxes  paint  lights  tools and 3D printing material for 7 boxes     UPDATE - We are extending the project to add functionality to the boxes to allow the charity to be notified when the boxes are full and ready for pickup.",False

Thousands of people are suddenly out of work and literally cannot put food on the table.    According to the Trussell Trust’s data  families with children have been hit the hardest by the pandemic and over 1.2 million food parcels were given out to people during the crisis by the Trust from 1st April to 30th September 2020. The Trust estimates that a further 670 000 people will be getting into poverty in 2021 where they will not be able to afford essentials like food and energy utilities.    More people have now died from coronavirus in the second wave than the first wave. In the UK to date  a total of 97 329 people have died due to the pandemic and over 3.62 million people have been infected and the numbers are rising.     According to the Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance  the new variant of the virus spreads between 30% and 70% faster than others and hence it is 30% more deadly (BBC). It is now mandatory to use face masks in various indoor settings as per the UK government guidelines. (GOV.UK)    When people cannot afford to put food in their mouths how could they afford to buy a face mask to cover their mouths?    IT IS TIME TO ACT NOW AND DO SOMETHING TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE NEW VIRUS VARIANT!    With the support of GoFundMe  I have started the campaign   “Face Masks 4 Foodbanks” to help provide face masks to foodbanks which they will distribute to their users.     Your donations will be spent on buying face masks at supplier’s cost price which will be donated to the hundreds of families who get food parcels from the following food banks.     1. Newham Foodbank  2. Tower Hamlets Foodbank - Firstlove Foundation   3. Ealing Foodbank  4. Hackney Foodbank  5. Brent Foodbank  6. Hounslow Community FoodBox  7. Bow Food Bank - Newham  8. The Felix Project  9. The Open Kitchen  10. Feltham Foodbank  11. St Paul's (Hounslow) Food Bank    Your donations will help these foodbank users to not only protect themselves but also to keep the more vulnerable safe from being infected by the virus through the coronavirus droplets from coughs  sneezes and speaking.    Together  let’s stop the spread of COVID-19 and ease the pressure on our NHS services. I hope the people of the UK will continue to show their kindness  compassion and generosity during these unprecedented times and with your donation  we can win the battle of the unseen enemy COVID-19.

Part of the criteria to birth this project is the construction of a storage to hold all of our donated items (cloths  food and other household items) .

response to COVID-19 we are raising vital funds so that the Foodbank can respond to increasing demand. We are facing an unprecedented challenge and so any donation will be warmly welcomed as we continue to support people most in need.    I am Rev Carol Bostridge  Senior Project Manager of Lewisham Foodbank  I live in Sydenham and have been employed part-time by the Foodbank for 5 years.

Our family were in awe by his altruistic desire to give  feed and aid ALL  despite race/ethnicity/religion among him even whilst suffering himself.     Since opening  our family alone have vetted 25 families with monthly food rations from December 2019- present. Unfortunately  25 families do not cover the innumerable amount of people starving  for whom we want to share some light  hope and nurture to amidst dark times  that is their indefinite reality.    Our foodbank prioritises poor families with children  single mothers/widowers and those who themselves or their children suffer with debilitating mental/physical health issues trying to make ends meet to provide for their children- this is done with rigorous checks by our team to ensure nobody exploits such a service. The families are issued with a monthly ration card valid for 12 months which provides them with stock for each month as per the individual needs of the family. These include: 10kg chapati flour (atta)  5kg sugar  5kg various lentils/daal  5kg rice  5L cooking oil  tea leaves  salt  spices and other necessary food items. £25 will feed a family of 5 for the month however any donation  no matter how big or small will impact them greatly.     100% of the donationsgo to those in need  with our incredible staff being voluntary workers (so no wages or salaries are deducted from donations) and our facilities funded with the finances that the late Safdar Hussain Shah left behind for us to carry this out in his legacy- we are relying on your kind donations which will solely provide stock for the families.     During the current COVID-19 crisis  we are aiming to try and provide emergency food supplies to all those suffering in the locale  with the most vulnerable holding priority  we are giving out thousands of food rations but are broken to see that we are unable to extend our help to everyone that needs it- as a small start-up charity  we are grateful for all the support and donations we receive in order to help us reach as many individuals suffering from the crisis as possible.     Unfortunately  we can't do this alone  with the power of unity together we can help fill the stomachs of the poor  not only with food but also the fulfilment of life and hope they may gradually receive from your donations. Our brothers and sisters around the globe need us  we are united by our efforts.   Any donation  no matter how big or small will be greatly appreciated especially in the blessed month of Ramadan  whereby charity is considered its greatest.     We are not the givers  we are just Allah SWT  the Almighty's  servants and can only give what he allows and wishes to be given. The families we aim to feed is by the grace of Allah SWT and it is he who provides to all.     May Allah SWT accept this from you and me  may we fulfil our duty by helping those in need  for which it is their right upon you and I.    “A man’s true wealth is the good he does in this world.” Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W)    Instagram: sadaqajariya.foodbank for further updates",False

This support started when there was no halal food support in the local area of Sharrow and Netheredge and people were struggling to buy basic food for themselves. Due to a gap in the area and a desperate need TSY collaborated with few others to collectively reach out to the most vulnerable including single parents  elderly  self isolating and hardship such as loss of income. All our work is voluntary and since March kind donations from local community has assisted us in making sure no one struggled alone. We are running low on cash donations to purchase food to continue this vital support and are reaching out to anyone who can support us by using this link and donating whatever little they can towards the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank project. Due to the level of need and referrals coming in since the start of this halal foodbank  we have called it Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank to avoid any barriers to any non-muslim vulnerable that maybe in need of this support. We would be very grateful for your support towards this cause and request you to please share widely amongst your contacts.

We have been working in collaboration with other local organisations and have provided hundreds of doorstep foodpacks.

We are also opening a new Foodbank at Thornton Heath Islamic Centre too; which will run in conjunction with our weekly soup kitchen on Monday evenings.

100/2020-04-12 10/2020-04-12 20","THANKS FOR VISITING MY FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN TO SAVE THE SUN NEWSPAPER AFTER THEY REPORTED A £201M LOSS AND THE COMPANY'S VALUE WAS ADJUSTED TO ZERO!    Throughout this Coronavirus crisis  Britain's most-loved newspaper has been under threat. Declining sales and advertising revenue could consign this shining example of journalistic standards to a terrible fate  and it's time that we stood up and took a stand.    The Sun was already suffering a financial crisis before Covid-19 even took hold ...      However  things have now become desperate for this historically blemish-free institution of British publishing with their very own Dan Wootton encouraging everyone to buy a copy and keep them in business - it does cost less than a cup of coffee after all.      Instead of just merely buying a copy to keep them in business  I want to take things further.    I will take every penny that is donated to this fundraising campaign and every day I will use it to buy copies of The Sun from my local store  and then deliver them absolutely free of charge to homes in my local area in South Essex. If other people follow my lead and set up their own fundraising campaigns  we could send their circulation through the roof in a matter of days!    IMPORTANT NOTE: During the lockdown  it's taking ages to get my kids to bed every night  and usually by the time they have settled down my local Sainsbury's is closed. If this happens on any particular day  I will donate the money to local food banks instead.    ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: I don't like rain  so if it is raining on any particular day I will donate any money collected to local food banks instead.    YET ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: I don't like sun or wind either  so if it is sunny or windy on any particular day I will donate any money collected to local food banks instead. I'm not fond of clouds either.    ONE FURTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: We should all be staying at home as much as possible at the moment to protect the NHS and save lives  and so if I think that there may be any people out and about in the United Kingdom at the same time as me on any particular day I will remain at home and donate any money collected to local food banks instead.    ONE MORE VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: If you actually think that I am giving that sh*t rag a single penny of this instead of donating the money to local food banks  you're very much mistaken.    Any questions? I'm on Facebook at Man Behaving Dadly - https://facebook.com/manbehavingdadly    ONE ABSOLUTELY VITAL NOTE THAT HAS BEEN DRAFTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MY ADVISORS    All money raised will be distributed to local food banks  and not given to The Sun  Rupert Murdoch  Rupert Bear  or indeed anyone other than local food banks.",False

Free Meals  Full Hearts is designed to bridge that gap and ensure that if your situations changes quickly  or you just need a little help - we're here for you. Anonymously.    I have heard some truly eye opening stories since creating this charitable group - everything from families only eating one meal a day and a couple who hadn't had a hot meal in days to another family who had literally only eaten canned beans and hoops for 10 days solidly because their weekly food budget was £9 to feed 5. It really does put life in perspective.    No-one in our community should go hungry. Ever.    The Reading community has shown time and time again that when faced with challenges or adversities  we come together. The camaraderie  generosity and positivity around us every day is overwhelming.    Feeding yourself and your family is a basic but essential human necessity but unfortunately far too many people in the Reading area are skipping meals and going hungry because they simply can't afford to eat. I can only imagine this must be particularly heartbreaking if you're a parent who is unable to feed your children. As momentum has increased and more and more people have heard about Free Meals  Full Hearts and we occasionally find ourselves struggling to help due to lack of physical food donations. When this happens  I either dip into the reserve pot or sometimes  out of my own pocket i'll buy emergency food shops for families (between £30-£50 per week depending on the size of the family).

The blasts in Beirut  were pretty devastating  but the important news in all this was that more than 6 000 people were injured  plus 150 killed  dozens still missing to this hour as rescue teams search for them  & hundreds of homes & people’s livelihoods were shattered  rendering nearly 3000 homeless.     As a result  Beirut has been declared a disaster striken city.     With the port -- Lebanon's economical lifeline -- totally destroyed   food shortages will spike & many families will go without.Already  Lebanon was suffering from massive food & fuel shortages  and now it will not be able to import anything. Bleak  darker days for hundreds of thousands of people lie ahead!     This is urgent.     Lebanon needs you now.    Please donate so we can ensure people have a place to stay safe  food to eat & the means to survive & overcome this catastrophe.    Pray for lebanon ...    Your help is more needed than ever     Your donations will help contribute to:    -hospital bills  -small repairs  -Buy basic food items to put together food parcels for many who will have nothing to eat today and in many more days to come.   -Life saving medications for those in need & unable to afford those.We need to help those on the ground with whatever means we can.    Help us help people   we beg you!         ___________________________________      Half the population are living in abject poverty.     People are dying  not from Covid  but from starvation  lack of medication and healthcare.    The economy  currency and banking system have failed. Inflation has been the final blow. Many in work have not been paid for months and others have lost their job and cannot feed their families or pay the rent.     Callers from across Lebanon have been begging for help on the programme “Sahtak Bill Dinyeh ” (your health is worth the world) on Sawt al Ghad radio .    Helped by many charitable people  the programme’s host Dory Nasr has distributed food  medicine and basic necessities.        Now the warehouse is empty.      Lebanese around the world and those sympathetic to the country’s plight can help by donating what they can. Every penny helps  paying for baby milk  food  medicine and housing.    Hala and Dana  two British-Lebanese expats  decided to kickstart this fundraiser to help secure both continuity and replenishment of the food bank. This is a much needed lifeline  without which many families will be doomed with both hunger and displacement.       Le Liban est au bord de l’effondrement total.    La moitié de la population vit dans une pauvreté extrême.    Les gens meurent  non pas de Covid  mais de faim  de manque de médicaments et de soins de santé.    L'économie  la monnaie et le système bancaire ont échoué. L'inflation a été le coup de grâce. Beaucoup d’employés n'ont pas reçu leurs salaires depuis des mois et d'autres ont perdu leur emploi et ne peuvent plus nourrir leurs familles  payer le loyer ou acheter des medicaments vitaux.    Les appelants de part et d’autre du Liban ont imploré l'aide sur l'émission «Sahtak Bill Dinyeh» (votre santé vaut le monde) sur la radio Sawt al Ghad .    Avec l’aide de nombreuses personnes charitables  l’animateur du programme  Dori Nasr  a distribué de la nourriture  des médicaments et des produits de première nécessité.    Maintenant  l'entrepôt est vide.    Les Libanais au monde entier et les sympathisants du sort du pays peuvent aider en donnant ce qu’ils peuvent. Chaque centime aide à payer pour le lait infantile  la nourriture  les médicaments et le logement. ",False

Since we were founded 10 months ago  we have continued to support local schools and their families with vital food packages. This is something that is really important to us as we have come to realise how many people are struggling in the county and have been shocked by it. We have built a fantastic relationship with local schools and knowing we are doing something for these young people and their families is very rewarding. As well as schools we have provided food packages to the Northamptonshire community mental health team  'leaving care': an organisation for individuals who are leaving the care system  HM probation services  local community groups as well as many families or vulnerable individuals who have reached out for support.     The McCarthy-Dixon foundation started initially as an emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a food bank and food delivery service. We have quickly broadened our services after realising the scope of both poverty and hardship in the local area. The community has always been at the heart of what we do and this means we will change and adapt to what the community needs.",False

Every week we take the money you have kindly donated to a cash and carry and buy  in bulk  what the four food banks we are working with have told us they desperately need. (See pics below). This is complemented by a weekly visit to the Felix Project where we load up with fresh fruit  veg  meat  eggs and cheese. All of this is delivered to community kitchens who cook up meals for those most in need in W10.    We are currently working with The Dalgarno Trust   Bay 20   The Space and The Tabernacle . All four of these charities provide meals  bags of shopping and many other support services to those experiencing food poverty in W10. Kensington and Chelsea boasts some of the highest net worth inhabitants but also has many pockets of severe deprivation – North Kensington is one of the deepest. A sobering fact to note is that 31.6% of children in this borough live in poverty.    Food banks we are working alongside unanimously concur that the demand for aid has tripled this year since the pandemic began. Help is needed more than ever. Every time we make a drop  the relief and joy the charities express is palpable and sums up how desperate the situation is.    All the money donated will be used to supply fruit  veg and essentials to those in need in North Kensington. Your financial donations will go entirely towards funding this food relief project. All staff  including Rima  Amanda  Maryam and the admin  safeguarding and marketing support team are volunteers.     Please share this page with anyone who might be interested in helping and please donate if you would like to help. A regular donation would make a huge difference  as food poverty is not going to go away.    Thank you for your invaluable support.    Rima  Maryam  Amanda and team.

Over the course of 11 weeks  they raised £16 000.
