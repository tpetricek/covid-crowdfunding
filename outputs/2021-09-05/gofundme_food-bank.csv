" Thank you High Peak Food Bank and Zink Project ","Buxton, East Midlands, United Kingdom",https://www.gofundme.com/f/thank-you-high-peak-food-bank-and-zink-project,500,175,2021-07-22,2021-06-22,"THE ZINK PROJECT CIO","Registered nonprofitDonations eligible for Gift Aid.",5,"2021-07-22 25/2021-06-30 100/2021-06-28 20/2021-06-24 10/2021-06-22 20","I first came in to contact with Zink in September last year. Having had a mental breakdown and suicide attempt I was struggling mentally and financially. I went to the food bank and while there I had a mini breakdown. This is when I met [Zink Advice Worker] Julie. Julie was extremely easy to talk to and quickly gained my trust to be able to talk to her. She helped me sort through piles of paperwork  speaking to people about bills and debts  getting me to speak to the right people to help me and being there when I just needed to talk. Since September I have been diagnosed with autism and the biggest problem I had was a debt to my landlord of over £4000 for which they had an eviction order. Julie was instrumental in helping me get a court hearing where the eviction was suspended. Julie's knowledge was brilliant and made we aware of funds/benefits available to me and because of this in under nine months I have been able to pay off (through myself and funds) the entire arrears and have the eviction set aside. For the first few months I was also reliant on the food bank side while my money git sorted.  I cannot thank Julie (and Zink and high peak food bank) enough for the last nine months. Without her and them I certainly wouldn't be in as good a position as I am now - mentally  financially and emotionally.   I want to give back and as I am not working I don't have the means to give what I want.   This is my thank you. Please help me so that they can continue to help people back on their feet the way they have helped me.   In addition to this I have had some lovely people on here and B and Q donate materials for making a mosaic and Buxton Woodwork  Buxton building supplies and Markovitz have all donated enough materials for me to make around six bird tables and several bird boxes. These will be being sold and auctioned off by Zink/food bank for some more money for them.   Thank you in advance as I say thanks to them",False

I’m married to john and have 5 beautiful children.   A few years ago john was working as a helicopter pilot. A career he had wanted since he was a child and absolutely adored.    But then he got sick. He struggled for a long time before doctors figured out he had several auto immune diseases all at once. He struggles every day with pain  sickness  and insomnia. He takes morphine every day and has done for years  with really debilitating side effects because the medical system can’t help him.   He was made redundant from his beloved job and eventually we lost our house to the bank as we couldn’t keep up with the mortgage. This is something he really struggles to accept. Since then we have gone from one disaster to another. We rent a house at the moment that the landlord wants us to move out so they can use it for something else but we have nowhere to go. The council can’t help us. No private landlord will help because john is not working and we cannot afford to get anywhere ourselves.     It’s really hard to watch our kids miss out on so much in their childhood. Some of them are too young to remember the amazing  fun  hardworking dad they had. Now they see him sick and weak and they see all the things they miss out on because we cannot afford it or because he is too ill to take part in it. It’s hard to hide our tears when we know there’s something they want but we can’t give it to them. Or hide our upset when we have to go to the food bank or sell some of our things to give them a birthday present or afford their homeschooling needs.   It’s very humbling to have to hold your hands up and admit you need help. For john to not be able to provide for his family is devastating. He is not able to admit we need help but I as a wife and mother know that humbling ourselves and asking for help is the only option left open to us.     Johns own doctors have told us about medication they believe will really help him and get him off the morphine. But they cannot prescribe this medication on the NHS and unfortunately we cannot afford to buy it privately. John was due to have an operation in January 2020 but it was postponed due to COViD and he is still waiting. He could get this operation in a matter of weeks privately but we cannot afford to pay for it. There are many things we could do to help him get better and get back to work but we cannot afford it. It’s extremely heartbreaking to know there is help right in front of us but we cannot take advantage of it because we don’t have enough money.     We have experienced people’s kindness throughout this process. We feel so ashamed that we have not been able to repay that kindness and to have to ask for more help but that’s exactly what I’m doing. I need my husband back. My kids need their father back and we need some stability in our lives again  we need a forever home.   If you could please help in anyway I would be so so grateful. You have no idea how much your help could change our lives. Please help me get my husband well again and not suffer so much everyday. Please me give my babies a forever home and a dad who is well enough to be the dad he always wanted to be.     Thank you for any help you can give and We would be so grateful for any prayers you could offer for our family. Xx    Edit:  Thank you all so much for your donations. It’s incredibly overwhelming to experience all your generosity and kindness. And thank you also to the people who have personally sent donations directly to us  Mavis & Chris and Marion O’Reilly.   We are totally humbled by your love and kindness. Thank you all xxxx",False

Chrissy will be heading a team of volunteers from the AP Foundation CIO  to take part in the 5km Run-through Lee Valley Velopark on Saturday 23rd October 2021. Her brave efforts will help raise money for the AP Foundation ""Made in London"" bus project. Made in LONDON is a multi-media training and intervention project delivered into the community on board a purpose-built double-decker bus  to help disadvantaged young people  and those at risk of exclusion from school  out of education  employment or training and at risk of offending  to change their lives for the better and reduce anti-social behaviour. The bus will travel into the heart of the community so that we can attract those who need us most and working alongside local Youth Offending Teams  Pupil Referral Units  Social Services  Police  Schools and Community services  we will make a difference. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause  which means so much to us all. Anyone wishing to take part in the run or willing to offer support please contact www.apfoundation.co.uk Help us by sharing on social media. Thank you.   1. The bus will function as a radio station. They will travel to different areas of London/ UK with a different artist every month performing in that area. Radio broadcast will be on radio frequency  and online platforms (Youtube  Instagram  FB live etc) 2. When the bus is not being used as a radio station  it will be used by underprivileged youths as a recording studio  to record their potential music and accompanying videos. 3. Programs will be offered in music production and recording that teens can sign up to attend online before the actual recording offers to begin. 4. A competition for best recording and music video can be offered at the end of the month with either monetary or product giveaway from sponsors  plus the opportunity to perform live on the radio and exposure to the radio’s listeners. 5. As well as performances from artists bringing light to the cause  our APF mentors will also have their own podcast and talk show. They would take calls from underprivileged kids or gang members  other ex-offenders and the like and give real-life advice based on their experiences helping give mentorship not only on a one-to-one basis but also that can be accessed online for many others that may need the same advice. 6. On radio off days  the bus can be used as a traveling food bank to bring food from supermarket sell-by produce to people who need it the most. We can also provide cups of tea or coffee to those in need of a hot drink and some company to ease the loneliness the Covid lockdown has brought to many. Volunteers for this would be from the foundation as a rehabilitation project for ex-offenders to give back to the community.       ",False

GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw Since We Care was launched as the UK's largest independent food bank and advice and support hub in Lewisham in 2014  we have always ensured that  during school holidays and Christmas  children and the hungry families they come from do not have to worry about putting food on the table. This half term  however  and over this coming Christmas  we truly need your help to feed the new wave of people and pets from across London who are in crisis and will be coming through our doors this winter at Kath's Place  50 Friendly Street  Deptford SE8 4DR.    But this October millions will lose £1040 through the cut to #UniversalCredit people many in low paid work & most already on the breadline not helped by the increasing high cost of rent & rising energy -transport costs .Can you imagine losing up to 20%plus of your monthly income? That is the reality for so many people in the present crisis. Rents are so high in our area that people in work do not have enough cash to pay the rent and  probably for the first time in their lives  are having to trade a visit to their local coffee shop for a visit to the We Care Food Bank and Food Pantry for help  advice  support and solidarity. Embarrased and even ashamed  but even more desperate and distraught that their kids are going hungry  mums tell us that they can go days without food  and  on average  it takes people at least a week of going hungry before they finally come through our doors and ask for help. We really do need your donation this Christmas GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw . Becasue we help everyone and anyone and do not focus on one particular group (such as refugees or the homeless) we get absolutely NO national or local government funding or any other type of funding. Anyone and everyone in crisis is welcome at We Care  #homeless #refugees #elderly #temporayhousing #lgbtq #bame #disabled #selfemployed #endchildfoodpoverty.

It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has launched to support our community and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.  The Lambeth Food Bank Fund   Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.   In Lambeth we have a history of looking after one another - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.   So we are creating something called the Lambeth Food Bank Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.   Our borough has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has been set up for us to help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.   Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Lambeth. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.     * * *   FAQs  What can I do?  Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the most vulnerable.   Where will the funds go?  The funds will go to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by Holy Trinity Clapham and delivered to food banks across the borough - including Brixton & Norwood  Clapham Park  Vauxhall  and Waterloo - that can help the most vulnerable.   If I do donate will it go to those who need it?   Yes  your donation will go to those who need it. Unlike other platforms  GoFundMe do not charge a fundraising fee although they take a small transaction fee. See here for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to.   I want to help my local community  will this money be spent in Lambeth?   Yes.   Where can I find accurate information about covid-19?

It’s crazy how the pandemic we currently living in has caused all kinds of financial difficulties situations and families have had no choice but to turn to the food banks for help and assistance. I know that raising money will help the food bank buy essential food. It saddens me to see how the numbers have doubled as more people are being impacted by COVID-19 with job losses and furlough leaving families struggling to find money to buy enough food. We have all seen the headlines regarding school meals but it's easy to forget for a lot of these children that is the only balanced meal they will get. In the first six months of the pandemic  some food banks in the United Kingdom gave out a staggering 1.2 million emergency food parcels. That’s one food parcel every 13 seconds  and 2 600 of these went to children every day on average. I decided to walk 2021 km and hopefully get this achieved within 10 months. So if you see me walking please give me a cheer and some motivational comments. Every penny helps put food on the table and allowing families to try not stress financially or have to choose between food and heating. So please consider donating to a worthy cause.    So I'm looking for your support. Together we can make a difference.  ",False

During the last 9 months we have also managed community events (socially distanced of course). For the VE Day bank holiday  we adapted our plans for a fun day and instead ran a house decorating competition (please look at our FB page for a vast array of photos). We have also has an Easter trail and a Halloween Trail. We also have colouring competitions that are open to all ages- adults included.

Due to the pandemic  countless numbers of small and local businesses have been forced to close - with barbershops/hair salons being examples of the businesses that are suffering the most. Now  the normal response for the owner of a business like this would be to take advantage of rate relief  seek bridge funding for the business and also look for financial support being offered to people that are self-employed.    But not Ziggy...        Ziggy has converted the Barbershop into a Food Bank that is specifically focused on helping the elderly and other vulnerable members of the local community to have access to the food and sustenance they need in a time when it may be challenging to make trips to supermarkets or go shopping themselves.    We all know that local businesses like barbershops are massive pillars within communities as they are connected to so many people and aware of a range of local issues. So  who better and where better for a Food Bank to support vulnerable people to come from?        As it stands  Ziggy is not only travelling (on his own dime) to his shop  to the homes of people who cannot make it to his Food Bank and even spending his own money to buy food if he is short on donations from local people that are aware his Food Bank Exists. ALL WHILST HE IS LOSING MONEY AS HE CANNOT TRADE AND RUN HIS BUSINESS AS NORMAL.

Now  we need your support more than ever.    Due to massive demand and the end of the lease on our current Warehouse we are moving to a brand new home that will help us increase our capacity and speed up our operations  helping us to continue to put food donated by the community straight into the hands of those who need it.     This is an exciting chapter in Canterbury Food Bank’s history  and a brilliant opportunity for us to grow and change in response to new challenges. But it is also an expensive chapter; our previous premises were occupied on a peppercorn lease of £10 a month  so by paying the market rate for a suitable property our rental costs have been multiplied 133 times.     We are asking our community to help us raise a year of rent - £16 000 - up front so that all other funds can be used to buy and deliver food. Please donate and share this appeal widely to secure the future of the Food Bank as a key charity in the district.     PRESS RELEASE -    Canterbury Food Bank today launched a campaign to help pay for its new building - after its rent multiplied 133 times.     The charity is moving to another warehouse  specially converted to suit its needs  because the lease on its current premises has come to an end.    CFB had been paying a peppercorn rent of £10 a month for the old building  but will now have to pay market rate of £16 000 a year.     Its Raise the Rent campaign aims to cover the rental costs so that all other funds can be used to buy and deliver food. The new  bigger warehouse  near Whitstable  secures the future of CFB as a key charity in the district.     Demand in the past 12 months has at times more than trebled year-on-year and in December it provided enough food to make more than 10 000 meals.     The economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 crisis  and the uncertainty of Brexit  are the main reasons behind the spike.    The charity has signed a five-year lease on the 3 780 square foot  two storey warehouse  which will be used to store donations of food and as an office.     CFB chair Martin Ward said: “We’re pleased and relieved to have secured our long-term future at a time when our services have never seen such high demand.     “It has become clear over the past year that  even more than ever  a backstop is needed to help those who can not afford food.     “We are that backstop and it is our intention to remain so for as long as we are required.     “These are difficult times for many people and we ask the public to help us support those most in need.”    CFB provides emergency three-day food parcels to individuals and families in financial need across Canterbury  Whitstable  Herne Bay and surrounding villages.    It has donation baskets in all leading supermarkets including Sainsbury’s  Tesco  Asda and Morrisons  where people can leave dried or tinned food items. ",False

We are all volunteers  so every penny donated gets used to help the people of Leyland who need it most.     Food donations are always most welcome  but they are sometimes not practical for people  while cash donations are a great help  as they mean not only we can buy in particular items when we run short of them   to help make up balanced parcels  they also act as a much-needed fall-back fund when food donations are low  so we can still maintain our service every week.    If you do choose to donate to this fundraiser  please accept our deepest thanks and gratitude  on behalf of ourselves and all the people we help.

My name is Hope and I have been a Hackney resident for almost six years. I feel very fortunate to live in such a brilliant area  and want to give something back.    Covid-19 has unfortunately left many in crisis  and the need for support from the community has been higher than ever.     In 2020  Hackney Foodbank reported that 19 400 households needed their support. This is a 263% increase from 2018.     The Government are currently offering an uplift in Universal Credit of £20 per week. However  they plan to stop this at the end of March. This has the potential to drive a further one million people to foodbanks across the UK.    Like everyone else  the majority of my last year has been spent on daily walks - now I want to make those steps count.     To raise money for my local foodbank  and awareness of the upcoming cuts in Universal Credit  I will be walking  running and cycling 20km a day for 20 days starting on Friday 25th March. This works out as 400km in distance  or around 4.5hours of walking a day.    My target is £400  £1 per km and I would love for you to sponsor me!     Any amount will be appreciated  even £5 will go a long way to making a difference in someone's life!     Thank you!",False

Our support project  which the foodbank is one stand of  is helping not only people in Garthdee  but 14 other communities in Aberdeen south  while we are helping many organisations to support their clients too.

This support started when there was no halal food support in the local area of Sharrow and Netheredge and people were struggling to buy basic food for themselves. Due to a gap in the area and a desperate need TSY collaborated with few others to collectively reach out to the most vulnerable including single parents  elderly  self isolating and hardship such as loss of income. All our work is voluntary and since March kind donations from local community has assisted us in making sure no one struggled alone. We are running low on cash donations to purchase food to continue this vital support and are reaching out to anyone who can support us by using this link and donating whatever little they can towards the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank project. Due to the level of need and referrals coming in since the start of this halal foodbank  we have called it Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank to avoid any barriers to any non-muslim vulnerable that maybe in need of this support. We would be very grateful for your support towards this cause and request you to please share widely amongst your contacts. For further information on TSY and the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank please feel free to contact:- Nighat Basharat (Founding Director) on 07988033534/[email redacted]",False

Rather than let good food go to waste we are working with The Street team Tunbridge Wells & Nourish Community Foodbank to supply cooked food to homeless people in Tunbridge Wells including Christmas Day and to raise vital funds for Nourish moving forwards  this will also enable us to cover some costs of running our business to keep it alive while supporting those in need.     We plan to use our contacts within the food trade to ensure that trade prices are achieved rather than paying high street costs We have set this page up to help with covering some the costs of cooking the food  anything above that will be donated.

We have distributed thousands of packs. We receive NO institutional funding and operate the Foodbank purely through donations from the community. When the mosque was closed because of Covid19 restrictions we continued providing food parcels to those in need. We have been working in collaboration with other local organisations and have provided hundreds of doorstep foodpacks. We are now preparing for the reopening of the Foodbank at South London Islamic Centre. We are also opening a new Foodbank at Thornton Heath Islamic Centre too; which will run in conjunction with our weekly soup kitchen on Monday evenings. We need your help! £15 provides a basic food pack with essential items. £2.50 provides a hot meal at our Soup Kitchen. Please support our Foodbanks and Soup Kitchen and help us  help families in South London who need food support.",False

Throughout this Coronavirus crisis  Britain's most-loved newspaper has been under threat. Declining sales and advertising revenue could consign this shining example of journalistic standards to a terrible fate  and it's time that we stood up and took a stand.    The Sun was already suffering a financial crisis before Covid-19 even took hold ...      However  things have now become desperate for this historically blemish-free institution of British publishing with their very own Dan Wootton encouraging everyone to buy a copy and keep them in business - it does cost less than a cup of coffee after all.      Instead of just merely buying a copy to keep them in business  I want to take things further.    I will take every penny that is donated to this fundraising campaign and every day I will use it to buy copies of The Sun from my local store  and then deliver them absolutely free of charge to homes in my local area in South Essex. If other people follow my lead and set up their own fundraising campaigns  we could send their circulation through the roof in a matter of days!    IMPORTANT NOTE: During the lockdown  it's taking ages to get my kids to bed every night  and usually by the time they have settled down my local Sainsbury's is closed. If this happens on any particular day  I will donate the money to local food banks instead.    ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: I don't like rain  so if it is raining on any particular day I will donate any money collected to local food banks instead.    YET ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: I don't like sun or wind either  so if it is sunny or windy on any particular day I will donate any money collected to local food banks instead. I'm not fond of clouds either.    ONE FURTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: We should all be staying at home as much as possible at the moment to protect the NHS and save lives  and so if I think that there may be any people out and about in the United Kingdom at the same time as me on any particular day I will remain at home and donate any money collected to local food banks instead.    ONE MORE VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: If you actually think that I am giving that sh*t rag a single penny of this instead of donating the money to local food banks  you're very much mistaken.    Any questions? I'm on Facebook at Man Behaving Dadly - https://facebook.com/manbehavingdadly    ONE ABSOLUTELY VITAL NOTE THAT HAS BEEN DRAFTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MY ADVISORS    All money raised will be distributed to local food banks  and not given to The Sun  Rupert Murdoch  Rupert Bear  or indeed anyone other than local food banks.",False

We made a short film about our work during the first lockdown  which has won many awards now in international film festivals. You can watch this short film here:    Feeding Lewisham    We really hope that our work will inspire YOU to donate NOW  and also to copy what we are doing here in Deptford in your local community.    We want to turn our unusable basement (which presently is just a bare) shell into a multi-functional community kitchen that will be able to feed anyone in crisis (no matter what their faith  gender  sexuality  or legal or economic status). We want to provide a place where people who love to cook  but who are unable to do so because of their housing situation  can enjoy cooking healthy balanced meals for themselves and others  which our volunteers can deliver to our clients who are in crisis  many of whom have very specific dietary requirements. Any surplus food will be sold in our community cafe to help fund our work.    The work of the We Care project at Kath's Place Deptford will be featured on ITV flagship current affairs programme London Tonight   7.30pm Thursday 11 February 2021 title ' on the breadline-Food Bank Britain ( Food Bank Britain is also the Title of Ray Woolford explosive book and Guide ).     Your donation will help us to create a not-for-profit community food hub model that any community in crisis and without funding or support from the government or local authorities could copy. We also hope that this kitchen will become a platform for generating new solutions to support people into work during the pandemic and beyond.

The blasts in Beirut  were pretty devastating  but the important news in all this was that more than 6 000 people were injured  plus 150 killed  dozens still missing to this hour as rescue teams search for them  & hundreds of homes & people’s livelihoods were shattered  rendering nearly 3000 homeless.     As a result  Beirut has been declared a disaster striken city.     With the port -- Lebanon's economical lifeline -- totally destroyed   food shortages will spike & many families will go without.Already  Lebanon was suffering from massive food & fuel shortages  and now it will not be able to import anything. Bleak  darker days for hundreds of thousands of people lie ahead!     This is urgent.     Lebanon needs you now.    Please donate so we can ensure people have a place to stay safe  food to eat & the means to survive & overcome this catastrophe.    Pray for lebanon ...    Your help is more needed than ever     Your donations will help contribute to:    -hospital bills  -small repairs  -Buy basic food items to put together food parcels for many who will have nothing to eat today and in many more days to come.   -Life saving medications for those in need & unable to afford those.We need to help those on the ground with whatever means we can.    Help us help people   we beg you!         ___________________________________      Half the population are living in abject poverty.     People are dying  not from Covid  but from starvation  lack of medication and healthcare.    The economy  currency and banking system have failed. Inflation has been the final blow. Many in work have not been paid for months and others have lost their job and cannot feed their families or pay the rent.     Callers from across Lebanon have been begging for help on the programme “Sahtak Bill Dinyeh ” (your health is worth the world) on Sawt al Ghad radio .    Helped by many charitable people  the programme’s host Dory Nasr has distributed food  medicine and basic necessities.        Now the warehouse is empty.      Lebanese around the world and those sympathetic to the country’s plight can help by donating what they can. Every penny helps  paying for baby milk  food  medicine and housing.    Hala and Dana  two British-Lebanese expats  decided to kickstart this fundraiser to help secure both continuity and replenishment of the food bank. This is a much needed lifeline  without which many families will be doomed with both hunger and displacement.       Le Liban est au bord de l’effondrement total.    La moitié de la population vit dans une pauvreté extrême.    Les gens meurent  non pas de Covid  mais de faim  de manque de médicaments et de soins de santé.    L'économie  la monnaie et le système bancaire ont échoué. L'inflation a été le coup de grâce. Beaucoup d’employés n'ont pas reçu leurs salaires depuis des mois et d'autres ont perdu leur emploi et ne peuvent plus nourrir leurs familles  payer le loyer ou acheter des medicaments vitaux.    Les appelants de part et d’autre du Liban ont imploré l'aide sur l'émission «Sahtak Bill Dinyeh» (votre santé vaut le monde) sur la radio Sawt al Ghad .    Avec l’aide de nombreuses personnes charitables  l’animateur du programme  Dori Nasr  a distribué de la nourriture  des médicaments et des produits de première nécessité.

Update: 3rd March  2021    Another interview with The Independent  describing the struggle to survive on Universal Credit and my fears about the cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/budget/budget-universal-credit-20-pounds-b1811750.htmlTaking this opportunity to thank everyone for their ongoing support - you are wonderful and I couldn't do this without you.   .  .  .      Update: 19th January  2021 I've been interviewed by The Independent about the catastrophic consequences of the upcoming Universal Credit cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/b1789040.html      .  .  .        My original message: 30th August  2019    This is incredibly difficult for me to write  but I need to ask my friends  acquaintances and perhaps even some people whom I don’t know  to help me get through the next few months.    I am a domestic abusive survivor struggling to meet essential living costs and the situation is going to escalate rapidly because my employer is deducting more than 25% of my pay from September onwards  to recover two overpayments they made in error for a really long time  without me or payroll noticing.    I’m already on a low income and have been trying to find a more stable job. Until now I’ve been working two jobs  but the temporary one is coming to an end and I will only have my permanent part-time job – where they have persistently tried to dismiss me on health grounds so aside from the overpayment recovery  I just can’t hold on there for much longer.    Whenever I do give my notice or get dismissed  they’ll take the entirety of my final month’s pay.    I live alone but the person I used to cohabit with left substantial utility bill debts at our home that I didn’t become aware of until later  since they lied about having cleared balances. There’s not enough space to move another person in  and I can’t move out right now for financial and contractual reasons.    Because of an active police investigation for rape and domestic abuse that I can’t go into  I’ve already borrowed money for unexpected costs like home security  numerous phone calls to charities and agencies offering professional advice  and private therapy which unfortunately I had to quit.    My chronically poor health has dramatically worsened – I’ve been to a&e twice in the past fortnight because of a kidney infection that didn’t respond to treatment and I had to pawn things to pay for my ongoing prescriptions  but there’s not much of value left for me to sell.    I need to wear glasses but have been doing without for several months since they broke; I’m doing without a lot of things. One of my cats needs dental surgery soon but this isn’t going to be possible.    I earn slightly too much to claim benefits or get free prescriptions and despite years of hospital referrals  I am still fighting for a diagnosis to explain my physical health problems so I’m not currently eligible for any support that could be claimed.    Unfortunately I’m estranged from my parents and I don’t have regular contact with any other family.    I don’t have savings and I wouldn’t realistically be able to repay any further money borrowed.    Up to this point I’ve managed to keep on top of the rent and buy cat food but I have now begun going without my own food  even before overpayment recovery has started. I’m hoping to access a food bank next week but the period I can use them for will be limited.    It’s hard to put a figure on how much help I should ask for  since the only real solution is me finding a job where they’re not actively trying to dismiss me for my chronic health problems  but I am hopeful that if I can just get straight with the money I already owe and raise a couple of months’ living expenses to buy myself time whilst finding a better job  then I can make things work.

Since we were founded 10 months ago  we have continued to support local schools and their families with vital food packages. This is something that is really important to us as we have come to realise how many people are struggling in the county and have been shocked by it. We have built a fantastic relationship with local schools and knowing we are doing something for these young people and their families is very rewarding. As well as schools we have provided food packages to the Northamptonshire community mental health team  'leaving care': an organisation for individuals who are leaving the care system  HM probation services  local community groups as well as many families or vulnerable individuals who have reached out for support.     The McCarthy-Dixon foundation started initially as an emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a food bank and food delivery service. We have quickly broadened our services after realising the scope of both poverty and hardship in the local area. The community has always been at the heart of what we do and this means we will change and adapt to what the community needs.",False

Every week we take the money you have kindly donated to a cash and carry and buy  in bulk  what the four food banks we are working with have told us they desperately need. (See pics below). This is complemented by a weekly visit to the Felix Project where we load up with fresh fruit  veg  meat  eggs and cheese. All of this is delivered to community kitchens who cook up meals for those most in need in W10.    We are currently working with The Dalgarno Trust   Bay 20   The Space and The Tabernacle . All four of these charities provide meals  bags of shopping and many other support services to those experiencing food poverty in W10. Kensington and Chelsea boasts some of the highest net worth inhabitants but also has many pockets of severe deprivation – North Kensington is one of the deepest. A sobering fact to note is that 31.6% of children in this borough live in poverty.    Food banks we are working alongside unanimously concur that the demand for aid has tripled this year since the pandemic began. Help is needed more than ever. Every time we make a drop  the relief and joy the charities express is palpable and sums up how desperate the situation is.    All the money donated will be used to supply fruit  veg and essentials to those in need in North Kensington. Your financial donations will go entirely towards funding this food relief project. All staff  including Rima  Amanda  Maryam and the admin  safeguarding and marketing support team are volunteers.     Please share this page with anyone who might be interested in helping and please donate if you would like to help. A regular donation would make a huge difference  as food poverty is not going to go away.    Thank you for your invaluable support.    Rima  Maryam  Amanda and team.    How to contact us:  Email: [email redacted]  Instagram: stjohnscafe    Call Rima: 07891 078 647    Or Amanda 07956 282 858    How it started: In March when the pandemic closed the doors of Rima’s Café at the Playground Theatre  she and her son Mars created a GoFundMe page to raise money for a Covid19 food relief campaign.

As a result of the partnerships which have been made we have been able to supply food parcels for up to 100 families a week at times  this does not account for the number of people who come to collect food items at the church and these are separate to the Foodbank referrals. The contacts for the food parcels have come through various schools  individuals and other groups. We have also arranged the purchase and packing of around 50 fresh fruit and vegetable parcels for the local food bank each week. Since the start of Covid we have produced over 1250 food parcels between the Wokingham Community Hub  the Foodbank and direct contacts.    The majority of the items we have are donated however with the financial donations we receive we are able to put this back into the project and purchase items that we require. Share- Wokingham has been open daily to anyone who can come along to Norreys Church  offering bakery items and any other surplus food stock we have – there is no charge for this but if people are able to make a donation  however small  it is always appreciated. This means it does not carry the stigma attached to going to the Foodbank as people are not just being able to feed themselves for little to no money but they are also having an environmental impact in tackling the waste issue.    As the pandemic has continued the needs of those that we support have changed  initially it was people who were shielding and unable to get out and now we are really seeing the economic impact  job losses and financial woes have meant that people are struggling - that is where we can support.",False

We are continuing to support these families in term time and the holidays.     £50 raised will be able to feed 25 young people    £100 raised will be able to feed 50 young people    £1000 raised will be able to feed 500 young people     There is power in our community. Join us.        Food provision through schools and youth clubs play an essential role in providing food for children and families who are in need of it - this is especially true during the holidays  when Free School Meals (FSM) are not usually available. Recently  the government (after several U-turns) decided to extend funding for FSM over the school holidays  but several families received substandard food packages that still forced them to rely on extra aid from food banks and mutual aid community groups.    Many young people are also not entitled to free school meals during term time because their parents earn above the amount allowed for eligibility for free school meals. In England  earnings from employment must be less than £16 190 for families in receipt of Child Tax or Working Tax Credits  and only £7 400 per year for families in receipt of Universal Credit.     This is staggeringly low and  when combined with measures such as the two child limit on Universal Credit payments  means that many families struggling to put food on the table are nevertheless deemed ineligible for free school meals. Other families are unable to claim FSM for their children because they have no recourse to public funds (NPRF) which is a condition the government imposes on some families due to their immigration status.      What does this mean?    Those recently impacted by the financial costs of COVID-19 (which are only increasing)  are more likely to go hungry. This will have bothphysiological and psychological impacts on young people and their families.     Why?    The data collected by CPAG on child poverty in the UK are enraging: 4.2 million children were living in poverty in the UK in 2018-19  out of which 700 000 were in London. This has been worsened by the fact that parents and carers are twice as likely to lose their jobs due to the pandemic.     In Lewisham  according to Trust for London   37% of children are in a situation of food insecurity  and 14% of the population needs social benefits to survive. It's deeply distressing that this level of inequality exists in the UK  particularly given that we are one of the richest countries in the world.     Don’t know what living with food insecurity feels like? See here .    The figures above reflect the shocking inequality in Britain  which was already severely impacting children and young people before the worst financial effects caused by the pandemic began to be felt. Due to the government’s lackluster response to the pandemic  it is projected that the number of children in poverty will increase to 5.2 million by 2022.     We also cannot ignore that this impact has not been distributed equally: people coming from Communities of Colour and immigrant background are over twice as likely to live in hardship than their white British counterparts and  due to the wider structural racial injustices  these communities are also disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. We are certainly not 'all in this together'.      What are we doing about it?     Legendary Community Club  which was named by Chevrington Odoh from the Pro Plus FC   is a grassroots project set up by some members of Lewisham Mutual Aid in partnership with local organisations. Our aim is to deliver emergency food provision to ensure that young people do not go without out  for as long as there is a need.       We will make this happen in three ways:    1. Temporary food provisions have been set-up for families who require this support  in partnership with local schools and community groups.    2. A kitchen has been set up to prepare nutritionally balanced meals for young people through their youth clubs which run after school and in the school holidays.    We know that food charity is not a long term solution. This is not the world we want to live in and we refuse to normalise food banks as a solution to food poverty. This is NOT an inevitable situation.    3. With this in mind  we will continue to work alongside The Children's Society  who have been calling on the government to ensure that every local council adequately funds emergency support for families   so that nobody is left behind in a time of crisis. For more information about their campaign 'Strengthening the Safety Net' see here   and sign the petition here.    We will also continue to support the calls from Save the Children and Child Poverty Action Group who have been lobbying for reforms to the benefits system  as well as an increase in the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit by £20  and an end to the two child limit and the £20 000 a year benefit cap which hits families in high-rent areas such as Lewisham particularly hard. Lastly  we will continue to support IFAN with the #CashFirst campaign  which has already inspired us to start our very own community-led participatory research project (stay tuned for more on this!).     The way our tax and welfare system is designed is a political choice. There are solutions . We will call on the government and its representatives to be bold  brave and radical in how they approach this problem.       What will we use the funds for?      We will use the money raised from the community to buy food and equipment for the project.    We have a host of volunteers  and multiple clubs and schools signed up and ready to go. The project began on July 21st 2020.       £50 raised will be able to feed 45 children     £100 raised will be able to feed 90 children     £1000 raised will be able to feed 909 children       There is power in our community.

Covid has affected us all but it has hit parts of our community harder than others.     We carried on the amazing work that St Barnabas Primary School began with a 'Community Food Share'  providing food and essential items to local families in this time of need.     We currently support families within the BS2 and surrounding areas  100% of your donations helps us maintain our resources to provide a varied weekly package.     Job security is becoming less stable as the furlough scheme tapers out  gig economy workers can find less work and self employed people are also facing uncertainty  there is still a further need to do more and support people at this time.     We stand together and bridge the gap with this amazing and unified part of Bristol.        Thank you.

The Project /Building Purley Masjid​    Purley Masjid is a modern Islamic community centre in a suburb of South London  Purley. It was established in 2015 after fund raising to accommodate the needs of the local Muslim community.    Ma Sha’ Allah  the Masjid is now trying to cope with the demand and has to overcome many challenges to support the Muslim and also non-Muslim community. Here are just a few of examples of the issues:     We have one main hall which accommodates only 200 people for an average Jumu’ah congregation of over 400.      People often have to wait outside in the forecourt for the second Jamaat     Current facilities for ladies accommodates around 30  whereas the demand is known to be in excess of 150. This is severely restricting our ability to meet current demand for women     Our lectures  Fitness Classes  Mother and Toddlers group  daily iftaris in Ramadhan and seniors meet up sessions all take place on the same carpeted area on which we pray. This is not ideal and as we are effectively operating out of one hall  it means that we can only have one activity happening at any given time     The Food Bank only has enough space for a shelf rack to store food. It caters for anyone in need in the Purley community  Muslim and non-Muslim alike        By the Grace of Allah swt we have embarked on the Building Purley Masjid project that will cater for the needs of the community. The project will result in a new Masjid on the current Purley Masjid site and will be a modern  purpose built building for the community spanning 6 floors that will include:     Two male prayer halls with a combined capacity of 500     A ladies prayer hall with capacity of over 200 and crèche facilities      A multi purpose hall     A dedicated lecture/events hall (we held over 100 last year)  which can accommodate 100 people     Improved facilities for our already existing Youth Activities  Mother and Toddlers Group and Seniors Group     Separate classrooms for our Madrasah classes      More space for our weekly Food Bank  ​​    We already have all these activities running at Purley Masjid but are struggling to meet demands and keep up the excellent level of service we provide.",False

Research conducted by several scientific institutions is showing that a significant number of people affected by COVID-19 go on to have symptoms for months after their initial illness. Most of us are young  previously healthy individuals who  by the official definition  initially suffered a “mild” form of the disease. Yet  months later  most of us are unable to return to work and to function at the level we were previously functioning at before falling ill.    This is beginning to attract the attention of the media  with articles being published in The Guardian  The Independent  the BBC  the Atlantic  and almost every major news provider. Despite that  the U.K. Government has so far failed to acknowledge our existence and to provide us with the medical attention and treatment we need  as is being done in other countries. We have therefore decided to launch a campaign to raise public awareness of our ongoing plight. The money we gather will be used to fund three different projects.    1.) Open letter: We plan to write an open letter signed by as many of us as possible that will be sent to decision makers  key figures  and officials in the U.K. government and the Healthcare sector to raise awareness of what we’re going through.    2.) Short Film: We are planning to produce a short film that will highlight what we’re going through. The film will include pictures of fellow “Long Haulers” holding up personal messages.    3.) Message in a Bottle: We plan to deliver a number of messages written by fellow Long Haulers to the door of Number 10  Downing Street. The messages will detail the suffering each writer has endured and will each be individually packed in a test tube to emphasise how trapped and isolated we feel. The funding will cover the costs of all three projects plus any future endeavours that the campaign team believes will contribute to raising awareness of long term covid sufferers  as well as any additional costs incurred.      The campaign team will not receive payment from the funds.      A detailed breakdown of costs as well as a description of the work currently being done can be provided by contacting the campaign team.

As a school  family is important to us  this year has been tough for so many different reasons and the pressures of this current climate are visible to all to see.    Many people have lost their jobs because of the virus  there has been a surge in the number of people becoming homeless and without food.    Being the community school we are  its only right that we are at the forefront of ‘building our community for our community’ we are doing this by setting up a food bank to provide food and essential items for our most vulnerable young people and families within our school and wider community.      More than 2.3 million Londoners live below the poverty line and 33% of adults have skipped meals to save money so that their children can eat.      The Charter School North Dulwich Go fund me page will help us to raise money to purchase food for our most vulnerable young people and families. During the festive period food was donated to the Southwark central community hub.     Our donations page will be ongoing after the new year and all throughout the academic school year and beyond     Food parcels are available on request.

About 200 per fortnight. I cook the meals with love and care and it is a privilege to be able to do so.     I began by wanting to help NHS and Care Home staff during the first Covid 19 lockdown in March 2020. So far I have cooked 0ver 6000 meals that I have made as delicious  pretty and nutritional as possible. I have also made sure they can be safely frozen and defrosted and can be re-heated in a microwave.     After 2 periods of self-isolation I started cooking from home on the 24th of April 2020 for the staff at my local care home  an NHS critical care nurse and a weeks worth of meals for an 89 year old I've been cooking for since he lost his wife years ago.     I have moved from 52 meals to a maximum of 206 on January 11 2021 and I am averaging about 100 per week at the moment (June 2021 ) I keep some meals in my freezer so that if anyone has a tough shift  they can contact me and I can give them a home-cooked meal to go home with. I spend 14 hours or so every Wednesday cooking for carers and will continue to do so for as long as I can; hopefully the rest of my life. The NHS has looked after me and my kids brilliantly and I want to give back.     I am utterly inspired by the NHS  Community Centre and Care Home Staff I meet. They make me want to be kinder  work harder and just be better.     My ultimate goal is to do this by teaching kids how to do the cooking with so that there is a double and ever growing benefit. But for now  I want to feed people and make their lives a little bit easier. I want them to be able to rely on a meal from me every Wednesday or Thursday.    Giving one person a wonderful meal means something. Donating is the same. I can make a little go a long way because I am brilliantly supported by Leathams for many ingredients  Nodene from Shands Cakes for Cakes  Ken Watts for eggs that go to Nodene to make the cakes  Val  Ian and Sue for the containers and 2000 portions so far of Swiss Chard from my Garden. 100% of the donations I receive will go towards buying ingredients  serving vessels  I have also bought protective gloves and a £50 freezer to be able to store more ingredients and meals.

Our plan is to have a refill shop run by the community and by people who have special education needs.       The refill shop will be run as a community interest company to keep the food prices competitive with local supermarkets  which would mean everyone can afford to shop plastic free helping the environment.        All money that is not put back into the buisness will go to local and environment causes.       We will also have a recycling center in our courtyard for everything that cannot go in the local grey bins.       Working with local organisations and supporting the Rutland Food Bank by taking donations at the shop and donating things that are coming to the end of their sell by dates.   We really need your help and support to set this up and are asking for donations to help start our new and exciting community project. Any donation big or small will be very much appreciated.   Also if companies would like to donate we will put a small thank you sticker with their logo onto what we bought with their money (this will most lightly be a food storage box or storage tube).   If you think you could help in any other way please contact us. We need people to help set up the shop i.e. - help with fitting  painting  decorating etc. Also help with running the shop like book keeping  restocking  ordering  working on the shop floor.   Thank you for reading and if you can help us it would be so appreciated      Jenni and Rutland Refill team ",False

BUT the arts are nowhere near recovery yet and our artists are in trouble; we need to keep going.     In March we set up a Crisis Fund for actors and artists whose work had disappeared overnight in the pandemic and for whom no government help was yet available.    We launched a GoFundMe campaign  folks were amazingly generous and we raised almost £25k. Since March we’ve given out over 100 grants of £200 to artists in our network and beyond. We’re almost through that pot of money now and  as the arts and live performance are unable to reopen  our support is still needed.     I’d like to share a story with you about one actor we’ve been able to help - we’ll call her Naomi. Scroll down to read her story.     Everyone is working hard to find other jobs and adapt for next few months  but unlike our government we don’t believe the answer is for our artists to retain and leave the industry. We will be poorer culturally  economically and spiritually without our thriving arts scenes.   We want to do our bit to help artists keep creating.    Can you help us help them?    Thank you so much for anything you can give.    With love     The Morphē Team    Cully  Ally  Sarah  Eleanor and Nate.     Meet Naomi. Naomi spent years building freelance acting and drama role-play work  including working for the NHS. She lost all her work in March and as a freelancer there was no employer who had responsibility to look after her. In May Naomi was told she was ineligible for government self-employed support because of a PAYE job she’d had for one season a couple of years ago. HMRC assessed her finances based on that year and decided she’d made too much money from PAYE work to count as freelance. However as that job ended a year ago the company wasn’t able to support her either. Naomi applied for Universal Credit but with months-long waiting lists she still hasn’t received anything. Naomi lived on some small savings  her mental-health and self-esteem deteriorating as she applied for job after job. September saw her needing to use food banks.    Morphē was put in touch with Naomi recently and we’re delighted to begin helping her with financial and emotional support. She told us we’d ‘restored her faith in humanity.’ We will continue to assist her and others until options become available.    Naomi’s story could have been any of ours. Many have fallen through the gaps of government help  often losing secondary jobs in hospitality at the same time.
