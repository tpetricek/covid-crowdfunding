I'm closing donations now as we have raised more than I could ever imagine - Im so grateful as I've never raised money for anything in my life and I feel so lucky to be able to help during this time.    We have completely smashed the target and have been able to widen the catchment area and feed families  in need all over London. I am in talks about how I can make this an on going thing so stay posted on my instagram page for updates. I will be ploughing through as many meals as I possibly can for the remainder of the week and splitting the remaining donations over helping more families with supermarket vouchers and local food bank donations.    THANK YOU!!    _____________________________________    Hey! My name is Karis and I run a plant based meal prep business based in South London.     We are currently facing an extremely sad & difficult time where many families across the country won’t be able to feed their children during this half term.    I posted on my instagram that I will be cooking home made  plant based  tasty & nutritious meals this week to deliver to those in need but I have had an overwhelming response from those who do need help and so many of you have asked to donate.     So  this go fund me page is to get more money for extra ingredients to cater for everyone who has reached out & widen the catchment area from just Croydon & Beckenham to the whole of London.    It’s so wonderful to see communities come together to help support those in need during this time.    Food is everything to me. Food is life. Food is love. But it is not a luxury and no child should go hungry.    The more we make the more can help.    Thank you for all of the shares & support on this so far.    With Love  Karis x ",False

Our party no longer trusts in the ‘generosity’ of Westminster to bridge the centuries old North-South divide. This tried and tested approach is destined to fail. The centrality of London  with its capacity to gobble-up all of this country’s assets  is built into the very fabric of the ‘United Kingdom.’ Infrastructure  people  resources  opportunities: all filter south by design. We believe  then  that only through a referendum – with a resounding ‘yes’ – will we solve  once and for all  that vast array of economic and social disparities that split this island in two. We have over 200 active volunteers using a free Slack workspace. But we have hundreds more signed up and waiting to join. Our next obstacle to overcome is to invest in a membership system and organisational tools so we can become sustainable and begin organising activities leading up to us challenging council seats in the local elections of 2021.     We are a transparent party run by ordinary Northerners. We have no secret donors or other means of generating an income. Our spend to date on the movement was £1.19 to register a domain name. But we have reached the point where we cannot go any further without incurring some additional expenses. We need: A Membership System Banking costs Zoom Professional A Virtual Business Workspace    You can read more about our party here: https://www.redpepper.org.uk/the-case-for-northern-independence/    Or follow us on Twitter @FreeNorthNow    --    This is a difficult time for many so you shouldn't feel bad if you aren't in a position to contribute financially right now.

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.    All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.    If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free. Thankyou for your support.    The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need  providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.    All the best    Jack Monroe.

But the coronavirus epidemic will be a massive challenge for them  on a whole new scale. More and more people are going to need their help over the next few months.    People on zero hours contracts won't get paid.    Food will need to be delivered to the elderly and sick who are self-isolating.    If schools close  many children will lose their main meal and need to be fed.    And all this is happening at a time when the rest of us are going to the supermarket less and - let's be honest - thinking about our own food cupboards first.    So  here's a very simple way to help. You give money. Every time we get to £100 I ask the foodbank what they need most and go and get it. If things get really bad  I will organise a delivery. We all keep doing this over and over again until things get better.      Why aren't Fair Frome doing this? Well  they've got a heck of a lot on their plate right now and this is one way I can take the load off them. It's also easier for me to set up a fundraiser as an individual.    Who am I anyway? Good question  I have volunteered for the food bank before  and here I am with Lenka  their co-ordinator  in the food bank. Fair Frome know that I am making this appeal and are very happy to have the fundraising happen.      I will post the receipt on here every time I go shopping.    But if you're still worried  please do take some food to the Fair Frome collection points in Sainsburys  Asda  Frome Wholefoods and Barnardos instead.       Frome is a great community.

She needed her broken leg amputated  and is currently resting up and recuperating. Thanks to our amazing donors  her vet fees were all paid for  and we have a little left over which we're going to reallocate to other needy cats via charities and our local food banks  as we always promised we would. Thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  to every single donor.     If you have a little extra to spare  please consider your local cat charity. <3     When I moved into my house I noticed a stray cat that lived in the bins. It was nervous  unfriendly and didn't belong to anyone. I called it Gary the Garbage cat.       I spoke to neighbours and put up Facebook posts trying to figure out whether Gary had an owner  with no luck. I'd put out wet food for Gary to eat  and over time Gary started following me home for dinner. Last month we hit a milestone: scritches  purrs and mutual miaowing. Gary still lived in the bins  or chimney flues of the shops by my house  but came to the yard for dinner.    A few weeks ago my boyfriend  Alex  saw some teenagers trying to kick Gary and chased them off  and his car has since been vandalised. We couldn't take Gary in and risk giving our own cats illnesses  so we bought Gary a little house for the garden and sought veterinary help. The charity Cats in Distress offered to pay for a visit to the vet.       The first visit never happened because Gary escaped while under the care of the rescue (wily minx) but we were reunited  and I set about giving Gary a bit of a clean up. At this point I was able to conclude...    Gary is a girl.        The newly-renamed Martha got a vet appointment rescheduled  and at the time we hoped it would just be a check up where we could assess her overall health  check her gungy eyes and look for a microchip.     However  last night  things took a turn.       Alex called me to say that Martha was walking with a limp  which hadn't happened before. I rushed home and picked her up to bring her in. The left paw was limp and she didn't want to put weight on it. I called the charity  who said to keep her safe and warm and wait for the appointment in the morning  but said that if Martha was injured they didn't have the funds to cover it. I was prepared  but hopeful that it was a sprain.    This morning we went to the vet  and the news was... well  it was bad.      Martha has broken teeth  a sore side and trauma to her face. She also has a suspected broken shoulder.    The vet said all of these injuries point to being kicked in the face.     The best case scenario for Martha is a mild fracture or dislocation. The worst case scenario is that we can't afford to treat the leg  and we all know what that means. She is about 4 or 5 and I am not ready to give up on her.    She is so affectionate and calm  even with this horrible injury. I need all the help I can get to literally get her back on her feet.    Any donations you can spare will go to Martha's vet fees and ongoing care. We don't know yet what she'll need  but the x-ray alone is going to cost £350  at best. That's assuming she will sit still under sedation and only needs two pictures taken.        In the unlikely  miraculous event that we raise more money than she needs for this injury we'll set up a fund for her ongoing care because she will now be completely uninsurable. Anything left over after that will be re-donated to other cats in need.     Please help us help Martha. She deserves better than the life she's had so far  and I can't afford to put it right on my own.     If you want to read more about Martha  you can catch up with the Twitter thread about her.",False

Since we were founded 10 months ago  we have continued to support local schools and their families with vital food packages. This is something that is really important to us as we have come to realise how many people are struggling in the county and have been shocked by it. We have built a fantastic relationship with local schools and knowing we are doing something for these young people and their families is very rewarding. As well as schools we have provided food packages to the Northamptonshire community mental health team  'leaving care': an organisation for individuals who are leaving the care system  HM probation services  local community groups as well as many families or vulnerable individuals who have reached out for support.     The McCarthy-Dixon foundation started initially as an emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a food bank and food delivery service. We have quickly broadened our services after realising the scope of both poverty and hardship in the local area. The community has always been at the heart of what we do and this means we will change and adapt to what the community needs.",False

By request I have set up a gofundme to cover ingredient costs. Anything raised above the goal will go to the local food bank.    Original Facebook post below:    Hello! As you may know  this week 322 MPs voted AGAINST a £15 a week food voucher for children in low-income families. If you’re struggling with feeding your kids next week during half term and live in Weston  I’d like to help!    I can’t change the world  but I can cook  and I’d like to offer eight families a free hot lunch on Monday  Tuesday and Wednesday next week. I’ll drop it off between 12pm and 2pm  please message me your address and how many are in your household.     When I was 17 I had a new baby and had just lost my mum. I was in and out of jobs because of my grief and mental health and I struggled to survive on the little help I got. I’ve not had enough money to pay my gas bill before and have had to cook pasta in the microwave to make sure my daughter got lunch  and I firmly believe that poverty isn’t a choice but an unfortunate circumstance  unlike our current government who think that hungry kids are a byproduct of parents simply ‘not being responsible’.     I manage these days and I’d like to pay it forward for all the times someone in the queue behind me paid for my shopping or a friend invited me round their house when I couldn’t afford my heating bill. Please get in touch if you need a helping hand.    Monday:    Pasta and meatballs in a secret five veg sauce     Tuesday:    Sausages  vegetable mash and gravy     Wednesday:    Five bean chilli-non-carne with garlic rice     Everything will be vegan  delicious  and packed with veg. Don’t be ashamed to ask for help. I was for years and I wished I’d reached out sooner ✨",False

With it being a tough few months for everyone stuck in lockdown  as the restrictions ease we are looking to get back to netball as soon as possible.    Many of the opportunities where we would fundraise for our netball club such as presentation night  quiz nights etc were cancelled therefore we are looking at a different approach to raise some funds this year which will benefit our club. We aim to run/cycle/walk 100 miles in October and to allow all members of our club to participate the younger players have been put into teams to complete this with one another. This will encourage team work to get the miles complete as well as a bit of fitness which we all love since we have not had any pre-season! Our older players will either work in teams of 2 or complete the 100 miles as an individual to really set the challenge! Not only will our club benefit from the fundraising but we have chosen 2 charities that we feel would really benefit from this too: Inverclyde Food Bank and Talk on Inverclyde    Both of which are very important during these hard times and we are working together to help a little where we can. 60% of the funds raised will go to the Clyde Netball Club and 20% each to the above charities.

50","Raising money for frontline nhs staff for food  accommodation and whatever else needed  and putting back into the community for food banks for families unable to work So lockdown is now upon us

grow back by the time we’re out of this sh#t ) They name there price  Check the link to see if they’ve donated And shave it !!!!! Please copy and share and let’s see how much we can raise for this much needed cause and have a barrel of laughs along the way. Before and after pics will make it so much funnier ",True

It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Robin Hood Fund has launched to support our city and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.    The Robin Hood Fund     Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.    In Nottingham we have a famous history of looking after one another. You could call it the spirit of Robin Hood - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.     So we are creating something called the Robin Hood Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.     Our city has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Robin Hood Fund has been set up for us to shine a light on these vital projects and help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.     Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that if possible you donate and contribute to the common good of Nottingham. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.    The spirit of Robin Hood has created something unique in our city  now is the time to reignite that spirit so please donate today if you can and if you can’t please help us spread the word.      * * *    FAQs    What can I do?    Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the vulnerable.     Where have funds been used?    Since the Robin Hood Fund started we have always had one goal  to raise as much money as possible to help those most in need.     To date; the following causes have been supported;     Since the Robin Hood Fund launched we have had one clear goal  to raise much needed funds to support the most vulnerable people in Nottingham during the Covid-19 crisis. Following an amazing response from the people and organisations of our city we have already exceeded all expectations in raising more than £75 000 which has been distributed - or is in the process of being distributed - to a number of charities and organisations undertaking such important work during these difficult times.      To date; the following causes have been supported:      Foodbanks (£20 000)    The Robin Hood Fund has distributed £20 000 in support of food banks across Nottingham. Working closely with Hope Nottingham and Nottingham Forest in the Community to deliver the wider support  food and supplies have been centrally purchased and then distributed to a number of different food banks  including: NG11 Clifton Foodbank  Meadows Foodbank  Grace Church  HOPE Nottingham  Bestwood & Bulwell Foodbank  Himmah / Muslim Hands  Arnold Foodbank and St. Ann’s Advice Centre.      Homeless Organisations (£10 000)    Emmanuel House was awarded £6 000 for additional specialist key worker support to boost its team at a time when Nottingham’s homeless community is at grave risk. This support is helping to ensure the homeless community are being placed into hotel accommodation as an emergency measure as hostels are very vulnerable to outbreaks.       There has also been £4 000 of support released to Framework to enable them to purchase essential items to the Homeless community in Nottingham. This included  but was not limited to  the provision of items such as mobile phones so that they can remain in contact with key workers and minimise the chance of these individuals being unable to stick to the government guidelines on social distancing.       Refugee Groups (£2 500)    Refugee Roots were provided with support to allow them to move from a model that required face to face contact  to being able to still provide support in a safe and socially distanced way.      In addition  Refugee Forum has been provided with funding for a destitution fund to ensure those with no access to support in other places can still get support.       Vulnerable Women (£4 500)    Nottingham Women's Centre have been awarded funding to help them to provide mental health support and online counselling  including training for counsellors to be able to provide online support.      In addition to this  further support was provided to POW Nottingham  an organisation supporting the rights of sex workers and those at risk of being exploited. This funding enabled them to purchase essential items including food and toiletries.      Disability Groups (£2 500)      With social distancing measures causing increased issues for the disability community in Nottingham  this support has enabled the Disability Support Nottingham organisation to increase its capability to provide phone support - in addition to welfare checks - to those in need.      Vulnerable Young People (£2 500)     Funding has also been provided to help support the amazing work of Nottingham YMCA  who are working with the most vulnerable young people in our city during this crisis. The support has helped to provide food and toiletries to those housed in supported YMCA and transitional accommodation.      Where will the funds go?    The most vulnerable people during this crisis and will be administered by the city council and delivered by people and organisations across the city that can help the most vulnerable.    Every Monday Nottingham City Council will administer the release of funds from GoFundMe to Nottingham City Council bank account. This means Nottingham City Council should  on average  have the money in the bank no later than Friday of every week.    Once in Nottingham City Council account the funds are ring fenced and held until the decision re: allocation has been made.    A working group  chaired by Lee Walker  will be set up to recommend how that branch of funds is released. This group is tasked with making the biggest impact possible whilst also being certain that the organisations in receipt a) need and b) promise to spend quickly ie. nobody saves the money. On Tuesday of each week the working group will have a paper approved by a member of ‘gold’ and paperwork will be sent to a small governance committee who are tasked with ethics and assuring the highest standards of governance and distribution.    Remotely the governance group will scrutinise and approve. Once approved Nottingham City Council agrees to distribute as agreed.    Money will then go out asap so groups and organisations are in receipt within 5 days. A one page press note to support and communication online to be transparent.      If I do donate will it go to those who need it?     Yes  100% of any donation will go to those who need it.    I want to help my local community; will this money be spent in Nottingham?     Yes.

Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland. Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen feed people seven days a week and will now be able to buy pallets of fresh produce to cook with  whilst the foodbank will be able to use the money to produce emergency three day food parcels.

" Feeding the NHS Night Staff ","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/feeding-the-nhs-night-staff,16494,20000,,2020-04-09,,,0,,"Do you want to join us in making a difference? We're raising money in aid of THE FRIENDS OF THE CHELSEA AND WESTMINSTER HOSPITAL and every donation will help. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to us.       OUR PROJECT IS TO FEED THE NIGHT SHIFT STAFF ON ITU WARDS    WHO WE ARE     We are Joe and Annabelle Colairo and  together with our family  we run a Cafe and Outside Catering company called Masters on Blackfriars Road  London. This is now closed  except for the kitchens  but check us out @ www.masterscatering.co.uk& on instagram @ masterscatering_london      THE PROBLEM      A consultant at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital told us that ""frontline staff were having a terrible and stressful time  working 12-14 hour shifts with no food available to them. The canteens are closed at night. The frontline staff  many of whom live alone  some of whom have to go to food banks  are exhausted after their long shifts "".          (Quotes from Alison Hulme’s texts - she is the Consultant paediatric surgeon who alerted us to this problem.)        “The IT Nurses are most at risk - poor things. I think they are having a gruelling time and so shopping and cooking is just too much for them when they are so low  both physically and emotionally”      “There is no time during shifts for a break  but a meal before or after would be hugely appreciated.”        THE SOLUTION      We specialise in supplying freshly cooked  nutritious and delicious meals. Joe is up at 4 in the morning  sourcing the best produce in New Covent Garden Market.      Since the 28th March  our chefs Sergio  Luis & Cesar have generously and freely volunteered to provide between 40 and 60 hot meals to frontline staff at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and The Royal London Hospital  Mile End.        WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP      Unfortunately we can’t sustain the cost of the food and packaging on our own any longer  and that’s why we need you.      You can be sure that your gift is well spent and it reaches the people most at risk and need.      * We are working on a NOT-FOR-PROFIT basis  * We have all the health  safety and 5* Hygiene certificates  * We know our nutritious meals will help keep the nurses healthier  * We know they will go directly to the nurses who need them most  those on the frontline  * Delivery is arranged by The Chelsham Road Community Association  who have Alison Hulme  a consultant paediatric surgeon  making sure it is delivered directly to the now expanded ITU unit. It goes in at 9pm.  * They also deliver treats  vitamin shots  fresh fruit and also much needed Organic Juice from PIPORGANIC.COM which is being supplied totally for free. The PPE kit is like wearing a plastic bag and dehydration is a problem for the nurses wearing it  * There are no middle men or large corporations taking a cut as with some other organisations  * The cost per meal is £3.50       PLEASE DONATE AND HELP US TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE CARING FOR US      In our experience  there are many donations for frontline staff working during the day  but not for those working at night. Where there are donations of food to the night shift staff  they never make it to them; and that's why we need your help.      “ Someone delivered 15 Pizzas 2 days ago and left them at reception. By the time they got to ITU there were only 2! “      WE KNOW OUR MEALS GET DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO ITU. ( By volunteers every night from Chelsham Road)      Here are some testimonials….      “Every day for the past 2 weeks I have collected 40 delicious wholesome  freshly cooked meals  half of which are vegetarian. The offering is wholeheartedly generous  inventive  varied  nutritious and of great quality.   I met one nurse leaving a 14 hour day shift  who had had some of Joe and Annabelle's meals when she was on night duty. She said “ Oh my goodness  I can’t tell you what a lifeline this is. Who are these people who are so amazing? It means so much to us - it makes me want to cry . I’ve been working all day and only finishing now at 9pm means I haven’t been able to eat all day. It’s like a war zone in there. Thank you  thank you  thank you. This is just what we need.” - Janie from Chelsham Road    ""ITU and theatre nurses are very grateful"" - Ben  Consultant     One of the nurses said they were anxious about getting ill and that its a very worrying time for them. They said the food is amazing and it gives them something to look forward to after a tough shift.      * The cost per meal is £3.50. We deliver 7 days a week which is 280 meals each week to Chelsea and we are looking to raise £980 amount per week.   We have the capacity to deliver more meals to different frontline staff in other hospitals if we have the funds and only if we have the direct access with the frontline staff and operating theatre night managers. Your money will go towards meals for those that need it most.       Thank you so much for making this possible.      Yours faithfully    Joe and Annabelle",False

But the problem I’m facing with this is I had more people offering help than coming for help. So speaking to some of the kind people who offered their help we agreed that I should raise money and then distribute it to local food banks and other charities that are already feeding families across Teesside and if things go well I’ll even be looking to help similar organisations that help families over the Christmas period that’s coming uptoo.   any donation is very welcome  let’s stick together and do some good for our own !

Once this crisis has passed  and it *will* pass  we will be donating the printer and any left over supplies to the local high school.

It is more important than ever that we work together to support one another. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund has launched to provide support to those most at need in our community. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund Right now many of us are understandably feeling anxious and vulnerable  but there are many among us that need immediate support in order to ensure that they can have access to food. Greenwich residents have a proud history of looking after one another - and never has this been more important than now. So I have been working with Greenwich Food Bank to create the Greenwich Food Bank Fund. As the borough faces one of its most important challenges in living memory  the Fund has been set up to ensure that those in need across the borough have access to the help they need. Please  even during this most difficult of times  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Greenwich. Please be assured that even the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference. Thank you for your generosity. FAQs Where will the funds go? The funds will go directly to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by the Greenwich Food Bank and delivered to food banks across the borough  from Blackheath to Eltham  Kidbrooke  Thamesmead and beyond. A full list of food bank locations is available at https://greenwich.foodbank.org.uk/locations/. If I donate will it go directly to those who need it? Yes  your donation will go directly to Greenwich Food Bank. Unlike some other platforms  GoFundMe does not charge a fundraising fee although it takes a small transaction fee.

","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/sahtak-bil-dineh,15950,20000,,2020-06-09,,,0,,"  Sahtak Bil Dineh Appeal update :    A mammoth explosion took place in Beirut this week.    The blasts in Beirut  were pretty devastating  but the important news in all this was that more than 6 000 people were injured  plus 150 killed  dozens still missing to this hour as rescue teams search for them  & hundreds of homes & people’s livelihoods were shattered  rendering nearly 3000 homeless.     As a result  Beirut has been declared a disaster striken city.     With the port -- Lebanon's economical lifeline -- totally destroyed   food shortages will spike & many families will go without.Already  Lebanon was suffering from massive food & fuel shortages  and now it will not be able to import anything. Bleak  darker days for hundreds of thousands of people lie ahead!     This is urgent.     Lebanon needs you now.    Please donate so we can ensure people have a place to stay safe  food to eat & the means to survive & overcome this catastrophe.    Pray for lebanon ...    Your help is more needed than ever     Your donations will help contribute to:    -hospital bills  -small repairs  -Buy basic food items to put together food parcels for many who will have nothing to eat today and in many more days to come.   -Life saving medications for those in need & unable to afford those.We need to help those on the ground with whatever means we can.    Help us help people   we beg you!         ___________________________________      Half the population are living in abject poverty.     People are dying  not from Covid  but from starvation  lack of medication and healthcare.    The economy  currency and banking system have failed. Inflation has been the final blow. Many in work have not been paid for months and others have lost their job and cannot feed their families or pay the rent.     Callers from across Lebanon have been begging for help on the programme “Sahtak Bill Dinyeh ” (your health is worth the world) on Sawt al Ghad radio .    Helped by many charitable people  the programme’s host Dory Nasr has distributed food  medicine and basic necessities.        Now the warehouse is empty.      Lebanese around the world and those sympathetic to the country’s plight can help by donating what they can. Every penny helps  paying for baby milk  food  medicine and housing.    Hala and Dana  two British-Lebanese expats  decided to kickstart this fundraiser to help secure both continuity and replenishment of the food bank. This is a much needed lifeline  without which many families will be doomed with both hunger and displacement.       Le Liban est au bord de l’effondrement total.    La moitié de la population vit dans une pauvreté extrême.    Les gens meurent  non pas de Covid  mais de faim  de manque de médicaments et de soins de santé.    L'économie  la monnaie et le système bancaire ont échoué. L'inflation a été le coup de grâce. Beaucoup d’employés n'ont pas reçu leurs salaires depuis des mois et d'autres ont perdu leur emploi et ne peuvent plus nourrir leurs familles  payer le loyer ou acheter des medicaments vitaux.    Les appelants de part et d’autre du Liban ont imploré l'aide sur l'émission «Sahtak Bill Dinyeh» (votre santé vaut le monde) sur la radio Sawt al Ghad .    Avec l’aide de nombreuses personnes charitables  l’animateur du programme  Dori Nasr  a distribué de la nourriture  des médicaments et des produits de première nécessité.    Maintenant  l'entrepôt est vide.    Les Libanais au monde entier et les sympathisants du sort du pays peuvent aider en donnant ce qu’ils peuvent.

" Bruces Bodmin Rotary Beard Bonanza ","Bodmin, South West England, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/bruces-bodmin-rotary-beard-bonanza,1240,1200,,2020-07-04,,,0,,"With major fundraising events like Band concerts  Duck Races and Street collections cancelled due to Covid-19  the Bodmin Rotary Club of which I am a Member have been looking for new fundraising events during lockdown.    The Club itself is considering a number of online fundraising ideas and as a Member of 10 years plus (as well as being a Member some 20 years ago) I thought to myself what can I do to help ?     All Rotary Clubs are a part of an International grouping of volunteers who give up some of their time to raise funds for and take part in projects designed to help and assist the local communities and internationally.    Bodmin in Cornwall is a charming (former) market town with an active (but ageing !} Rotary Club of 27 Members who raise funds and  in normal times  participate in numerous activities. These are many and varied and include supporting the local food bank and memory cafe as well as assisting young people both educationally and in social development. The Club also supports local fundraising activities of charities such as MNDA  Hospital League of Friends as well as supporting Shelterbox. Internationally numerous other activities have recently included the refurbishment and delivery of a fire appliance to a remote settlement in Albania.    As one clearly in the old fool category I'm not fit enough to run up and down stairs a million times or unaware enough to scoff 200 pancakes in one go (possibly not even a tempting thought) so I looked for a way to help the Club within my capabilities. I live in Bodmin with my wife Carol and have for the last 40 years or so (with the exception of a few days) sported a beard. Since lockdown the relatively manicured hair has grown into a luxuriant beard of which I am quite proud and I thought I could possibly with your help raise some funds for the Rotary Club by having it removed...    My wife is not so keen as she has persistently maintained I would have a facial similarity to a Chipmunk without it ! Hey ho....being of a repressed devil may care personality I thought I'd be a brave Chipmunk and have a sponsored beard shave with all proceeds going to Bodmin Rotary and I'm hoping to raise at least £250 (or as much as possible) to part with Santas pride and joy…....    I feel passionately that local community volunteer organisations are increasingly important in this changing and challenging world and I hope you will feel able to support me in my effort.    I intend to be 'de-Santa' on 5th August and would welcome your sponsorship if only to be able to witness how like a Chipmunk I really am!    All funds raised will go directly to Bodmin Rotary Club    Many thanks    Bruce Tyzzer",False

These will range from local Pupil Referral Units who need resources for vulnerable children across to food banks in neighbourhoods in Reading. Rest assured that every penny given will go straight into projects that Leighton Park School has contact and connection with. Our aim  like yours  is to be working shoulder to shoulder with our community in the fight against COVID and we know together we can do it. ** As I'm sure you are aware  there is a critical shortage of medical PPE at the moment. Local Primary Care services and hospitals have been requesting support over social media to help them overcome these shortages of protection for their frontline staff. I (along with many colleagues from my school) am helping to support our local healthcare services by producing faceshields that we are giving  free of charge  to any at risk workers in local hospitals  GP surgeries and care homes. We are in a fortunate position that we have access to a laser cutter that can be manned 24 hours a day should the demand require. We also have residential staff who are willing to support me and my Design & Technology Department with this venture and offer their time. I have already been overwhelmed with the response from local GPs who have heard about what we are doing here at Leighton Park and have rung me to request some face shields for their staff as they are woefully under-resourced when it comes to protective equipment. I had originally thought we would make 200 face shields  which we would have funded as a school  but there is quite clearly a much greater need  so I have set us the ambitious task of making 1 000 pieces. As you can imagine  this comes with a significant cost implication  despite the masks working out at about £1 each. I have had parents of our wonderful students contacting me and asking of they can contribute towards this project  so I felt it would be helpful to set up this GoFundMe page to help us achieve our mission. As I said earlier  we have the available equipment and skilled staff on site  the willing volunteers (who have already been amazing) and the contacts for additional materials  so our only limiting factor is the financing of the project. If you have the funds to help us realise our goal  your contributions would be enormously appreciated by us and the staff we are looking to help. Thank you!",False

We are asking you to help us  by donating what you can to this crowdfund  and joining us on 22 August for an evening of pride  performance and love for Beirut  its people and its reconstruction. Rebuilding Beirut with Pride will be hosted at the Bell Pub in Whitechapel  and live-streamed all night for everyone to watch and take part in. From an art auction to a programme of performance  we want to celebrate Arab and queer art and talent and help rebuild our hometown in the process. Click here to buy your tickets for the event.    Where is the money going?    All proceeds will be equally split and donated to the Lebanese Red Cross  Beit El Baraka   Basmeh & Zeitooneh and Embrace Lebanon   as well as two grassroots LGBT+ crowdfunds  detailed below.     Beit El Baraka provide food banks for victims of the disaster  Basmeh & Zeitooneh are responding on the ground to those who have been made homeless  and Embrace Lebanon offers mental health support.     The NGOs were chosen after having direct discussions with several people within Lebanon itself who informed us of which organisations are trustworthy and are not affiliated with government authorities in any way  to ensure the money is directly going to support those in need first and foremost.    We have also identified two crowdfunds that have been strongly recommended to us by many members of Beirut's LGBTQ+ community  in that they are offering on-the-ground and direct support and are being led by trusted community members.     These crowdfunds are Disaster Relief for Lebanese Transgender Community   led by Lebanese trans pioneer Sasha Elijah  and Funds for LGBTQ Victims of Beirut Explosion   led by prominent community member Sandra Melhem.    The total sum raised will be split 6-way between these 6 beneficiaries  and receipts of these donations will be posted here for completely transparency.     Why are we fundraising?     Beirut is a disaster zone. On the 4th of August  the city was rocked by a colossal explosion involving 2 750 tons of ammonium nitrate. To put things in perspective  it is one of the worse urban explosions since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The blast killed at least 157 people and injured 5 000. Hundreds remain missing. With the force of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake  the explosion's shock wave enveloped Beirut  shattering windows and collapsing old buildings. Lebanon's hospitals - already overrun by coronavirus - are in dire need of support. Meanwhile  around 300 000 people have been displaced from their homes. Two of Beirut's LGBTQ+ hubs  Mar Mikhael and Gemmayze  were only 500m away from the point of detonation. These areas have been utterly devastated and  like many other parts of Beirut  are now uninhabitable.    The blast comes at the worse time for Lebanon  hitting a country already in disaster. Covid-19 exacerbated a pre-existing political and economic crisis  bringing the Lebanese to the brink of collapse. This year has seen thousands of Lebanese lose their lifetime savings and the country's hyper-inflated currency remains in free-fall. One in the three people are unemployed  while amongst Lebanon's poorest  famine is approaching. In short  your donations are needed. They will support those people immediately impacted by the explosion  but also Lebanese communities and families facing economic desolation. Please see below for which NGOs and groups we are donating to.    What's happening on the 22nd?     While we encourage you support us  share this page and ask all your friends to donate throughout the next two weeks  we have an exciting day planned to drum up even more donations! On 22 August there are two events you need to know about:    6:30PM: Art Auction (online)     We will be auctioning a collection of both Arab and Queer art  prints and designs  kindly donated by artists and designers from both the UK and Lebanon.

IDAS is a specialist charity in Yorkshire supporting anyone who has experience of or is affected by domestic abuse and/or sexual violence. The Hub Food Bank and Cardigan Food Bank supply urgent food for families in crisis. GTBAL is a community-based charity that supports those dealing with mental health issues.    All four charities are organisations that are very close to our hearts and are in need of support in these difficult times.

Businesses and families coming together in so many ways to help provide a good meal for our people. The true sense of community and a nation united and agreeing to understand that no matter what our personal circumstances are we can all do something to help and there could not be a better cause than our future generations chances of a decent education and life.    Me and my mum were helped many times throughout my childhood from volunteer workers  food banks  homeless housing  free school meals and many other services which were available to us. We still struggled. It scares me to think what some parents would be forced to put themselves through to make sure their child gets a meal. it scares me to think where i would be if i did not have these services available.    This is me wanting to do my bit  inspired by the amazing efforts from our entire nation  while struggling ourselves  still giving back.    We want to raise 50 THOUSAND POUNDS!!!! Every single penny will be split across local foodbanks and help services in need around greater Manchester.    What a feeling it will be to deliver such help to the most deserving people.    Please. we need 10.000 5ers     thats it! please share  please actually ask people and make them aware.    no child should go hungry.",True

The fall off in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that we have had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased our costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries.

The need for supplies is greater than ever!     Coronavirus is spreading  so is the hunger.     Everyone is buying online now so whatever they used to collect from collection points now they can’t. Everyone is buying (bought) in bulk so now a lot of things are not in stock in the shops.     In honour of welcoming Ramadhan I thought to call Manchester Central Food Bank and ask if they needed anything. I went shopping and delivered the items to the foodbank today (Thursday 23rd April).       But  even with a budget of £200  I did not manage to buy even a quarter of the things that the Food Bank needed. I realised quickly I cannot do it alone. The volunteers are already spending their own money but that’s only 10% of the donations. The other 90% comes from public donations which at the moment is very low.     If you want to give out in charity because of the blessed month of Ramadhan then this is your chance too.     Make sure you donate and help us provide essential food for our local community in Manchester Foodbank.    £10 can buy 5 - 10 items  £20 can buy 10 to 20 items  £50 can buy 30 to 55 items  £100 can buy 55 to 85 items    Thank you for supporting me in helping our community.

We had a small car and so we could not spend all the money on this day.

For 4 years  we owned a prominent petrol/gas station in Hillsborough  North Carolina (USA)  until it tragically caught fire in June  2009. Our insurance company did not give us a fair payout. In December  2007 we moved our family to Ghana  Africa to start up a new business and carry out missionary duties. After a series of extreme robberies  we decided to join my husband's side of the family in the United Kingdom to start a new life.      For the past 6 ½ years  the Home Office have denied our family the right to remain and work in the UK several times after arriving on a visitor’s visa. Because of our legal status in the UK  we are not entitled to ANY benefits (despite my son being born here)  and have been dependant on food banks  our church  and the kindness of strangers.     Despite these barriers  our family have been heavily involved in our community here and play an instrumental role in various lives. Collectly  we have won several awards for the way we engage  volunteer and serve our community.

A week later  (22nd of October  2015) my husband passed away suddenly due to the stress of moving our family back to the States and the thought of his children's hopes and aspirations were shattered.    Me and my 4 children have been left devastated  destitute and hopeless. Our health is down. Our minds are overcrowded. We terribly miss our leader and provider.

When we were little  growing up in the 90’s  my siblings and I had free school meals  through middle school and high school  and I know how thankful my mum was of these free lunches. We had very little money This was back in the day where very little money meant just that. We didn’t have SKY TV  or mobile phone bills and my mum would go without food so that we could have new clothes and didn’t get bullied at school. These were the days when the supermarkets had a price war on tins of their own brand baked beans Anyone remember that? When they went so low  that at one point they were 1p! Yes 1p! And my mum would take me and my siblings and we would go in separately and purchase 6 tins each (the maximum you were allowed to buy) for a penny each. Because baked beans could really fill out any meal  and was the cheapest thing to buy. I still remember this to this day. ☺️          Some might say  if you can’t afford to feed your kids  then why have them? But right now there are so many families who  6 months ago were absolutely fine. And we know this first hand through work that Aron is involved with alongside the shop. We know that there are families  who have lost their jobs and can’t find a new one. Or families that haven’t had any help from the government through this whole Covid situation. There are families now using food banks because they don’t have enough money to go shopping. This is not a child’s fault. No-one chose for this year to pan out the way it did. And as such we want to help.           Each year  normally at Christmas we do something for the local food banks or food charities. Although this year  our business has been hit super hard with the huge number of postponements of weddings  and the uncertainty of peoples buying habits  we know that our children won’t go hungry this half term. And so we want to give back.           We know we’re a little late  but really it’s never to late to help. We want to donate 15 food parcels  including food for lunches this week as well as some essential foods  to families who are really struggling. So...          If you know a family that are visiting food banks.     If you’re a family that don’t know how you’re going to feed your kids this holiday.     If you’re a teacher who knows of a family who needs a little help          Then please message us privately to arrange collection of a small food parcel. There will be no judgement from anyone here. Parcels will be ready to collect this Monday & Tuesday between 10-4 at the shop.

In a very short time  we set up a non-partisan volunteer network in the area and are coordinating alongside councillors  cabinet members  community leaders  emergency services and health professionals and also with the local authority to meet the needs of local people.     The following is a segment from BBC national news that covered some of our volunteers checking on residents in the L18 area.        It is still unknown how our community might be impacted by the crisis and how different services will be able to respond to resident's needs. We are constantly evolving what we do and our response to the community's needs. We are following the the guidance of local authorities  public health bodies  and medical professionals to ensure that any action we take is safe.        We need some financial support to cover basic expenses for administration and volunteers (web & email hosting  stationery  fuel  emergency food purchases for vulnerable people  telephone and SMS text services).    We have DBS checked volunteers in place as well as a safeguarding team and are tracking everything we do from start to finish. We are also working in partnership with South Liverpool Food Banks  who will use our volunteers for food parcel deliveries.    We have set up a dedicated bank account for the network and have appointed two auditors to oversee any financial transactions.    We currently have 236 volunteers.        Your generosity would be hugely appreciated by those elderly and vulnerable residents in and around our community that are frightened and depend on our support.    Thank you.

There are many families struggling to put food on the table and the support forFood Banks is rising to meet the demand of those that are struggling. What started off for me was helping out one family which then turned in to a one man operation helping many Hostels Food Banks  vulnerable individuals across London.   From my home   I started contacting friends and families to support with food donations which Were then delivered in Harrow which turned into supporting Food Banks Hostels across London.   What I have realised being on the road and talking to various groups that this situation will not go away anytime soon and may get worse as more job losses occur and the reliance on Food Banks increasing .   I have decided that with the connections and networks I have formulated over the last 3 months I will create a network working with local partners where we can deliver the Aid for all those Food Banks  Hostels and families who struggle.    With that comes cost and I am raising funds to initially set up this network across London and to continue to support the community.",True

who have been struggling since the Coronavirus outbreak. Last week alone  they helped 285 families and they expect this to increase in the coming weeks. Some of our players and friends of the club  will run a combined total of 200km in one day (this Saturday 2nd of May)  and each individual will contribute with either a 5km or 10km  also ensuring the governments social distancing guidelines are adhered to.

Her beloved husband and two children are left to try and pick up the pieces whilst dealing with the heartache and financial burden in the wicked wake of this disease.     Janet was the most caring and selfless woman  always putting the needs of others before her own. She suffered from an autoimmune disease and asthma but despite this  she wanted to give to the community and help as many people as she could. During the first lockdown  Janet reached out to the local area - hand-delivering letters introducing herself  giving her contact details  and reassuring people she was there for them whether this was for an ear to listen  or if they needed support with getting shopping or medical prescriptions; she was there for everyone and anyone.    She has always been such a generous  charitable  and kind natured person  supporting and caring for everyone who came into her life – it was in her nature.     Before lockdown she regularly held MacMillan  coffee mornings and worked for the local council - working with deprived areas in the community as well as working in schools  raising awareness for children in poverty. Janet also supported many other charities including food banks and Christmas appeals. She was an active member in her local church  where she will be dearly missed.    Janet's act of kindness did not stop there as  at the age of 52  she went into fostering. She fostered two boys who lost their grandfather during the lockdown. Again  not thinking of herself but the children that had lost their family. She fostered the boys until she sadly passed away.    This page has been created to help raise awareness of the devastating impact covid-19 has on families and to support her family with the financial costs involved in her passing. In this time of need  Janet’s husband is out of work as he usually works away. This is not something he is able to continue due to the support his children and grandchildren need right now.    Coronavirus really has had a devastatingly emotional and financial impact on her family – please stay at home and take heed of government guidelines  it really could save your life.",True

The plan is for my sister/mum to use this money to buy food supplies and donate them to the local food bank in Preston.     After the recent disgusting ruling by the UK Government about school meals  I wanted to try and do something for the local area I grew up in.     I feel like I have been naive to how real child poverty is  and how serious it is. Admittedly it shouldn' have taken a vote in government to highlight this issue to me  but I would like to do something.     COVID is shit enough  so any help I hope will make some sort of difference.     I used Go Fund me  rather than Just Giving as I wanted to use the money for several food banks  just in case people were wondering.     Anything you may be able to donate is so appreciated.   Thank you.",True

Aim: To counteract the long-term effects on well-being and nature deficit caused by prolonged isolation from the natural world and community.     Aim: Raise the poverty of aspiration for families and children deeply affected by the economic fallout of the Coronavirus pandemic through nature exposure and community connection.     History   Up until three weeks ago our Forest Schools were working in schools  community centres  and in after school clubs delivering Forest School to our local children  taking small groups to woodlands and inner city wild spaces to discover their untapped creativity and grow their self-esteem to set them on a path towards self-actualisation. Children who may not have been seen to be ‘flourishing’ in a traditional classroom setting  benefited hugely to unrestricted  self-directed play and discovery in these natural environments.     There is a need for this vital journey to continue  as the Coronavirus and self-isolation change further how we interact with our environment and each other and as the gap widens in our societies ‘cultural capital’.     The need for funded and supported workshops is made more urgent by the economic disparity that has increased due to the outbreak.     Our funded places will focus on those who may find ‘investing’ in their own and families health and wellbeing less attractive due to pressing financial challenges  and the widening social gap created by income loss and instability.     Context: There is a nature deficit unraveling in our society  which due to the current outbreak of Coronavirus has become a symbiotic epidemic. Children and families are divorced from their inherent need for nature and community and the mental health and well-being of families is of upmost concern. Please read my Facebook page for further information regarding this. www.facebook.com/northlondonjuniorforestschool        The program    Postal Activity Boxes for those on free-school meals and single parent households.     The packs contain a craft activity  a ‘How to’ instruction sheet with a newsletter with fun craft  foraging food suggestions and recipes  and food growing ideas for families to try at home.     There is a website for children to upload photos of their work  and write blogs of what they did  to act as a community space for sharing their ideas each week. The website also has videos made by the Forest School leaders demonstrating how to do the crafts that have been posted.     The activity packs are posted directly to families  using our links with local organisations such as primary schools  community groups  and parents. During the current lockdown there are many households with no gardens to access nature  but there is the opportunity to exercise outdoors once a day and engage with our urban wild spaces to collect leaves  sticks  grasses  flowers  berries and seeds to take home and experiment with. Some households may be enjoying their gardens  but need structure to explore and discover new challenges to engage them in this environment.     Following the Forest School ethos of self-discovery the Postal Nature Activity box concentrates on providing opportunities to connect with themselves and their community through nature based activities. It offers an invitation to play through storytelling and games and challenges picked to bolster their creativity and engagement with natural materials / resources.     It is currently targeted at families with free-school meal status  those in single parent households and those visiting local food banks.       The woodland based after care Forest School     When the isolation rules are relaxed we will invite the groups signed up to the postal scheme to come and join our Forest School sessions. These sessions will concentrate on resilience building  risk-taking in natural environments  circle and community sharing circles and reflections  and will be led by 2 Level 3 trained Forest School leaders with over 15years of experience working with young people and families.      Through regular 2-hour sessions in local woodlands and urban wild spaces we offer children and parents who may not otherwise have regular access to the outdoors an opportunity to connect with themselves  their community and their environment through nature based activities and community building games and challenges.     Each session follows a well-defined but flexible structure  changing with the resulting needs of the group at that particular session  but can include fire-lighting  cooking on camp fires  rope-work/ shelter building  weaving  green woodwork  felting and other nature based crafts; activities that appeal to the sensory and physical connection to nature and the environment. The activities are also carefully planned to ensure personal connection with the group  and the Forest School community  challenging participants to work together as a whole and in teams.     Particularly important to the sessions outcomes are community building games  circle sharing and reflection  and revisiting of feelings and emotions whilst partaking in the activities.

She’d fought for so many years with her mental health and I’d always hoped she’d overcome the demons she carried around with her.   It’s never been something I hid but it might not be something you knew about my mum. She was a fierce lady  know what she wanted and when. Didn’t wait for nothing or no one.    Her Bipolar disorder was just a part of her that over the years became too much. There was highs and there where low lows. The highs I can smile about but the lows are something that I hope no one has to go through alone. My mum loved a good sing and dance... especially to Adele or M People. She enjoyed her holidays  especially to Corfu where I will forever remember her beaming smile ear to ear every second she was there. I hope that’s exactly what she’s doing now and forever more.     After a short stay in hospital my mum sadly passed away in her sleep after testing positive for Covid 19 serval hours earlier. I am raising money towards additional her funeral costs.

Being part of a coastal economy is always difficult over the winter months  but the impact of COVID-19 is potentially catastrophic. Every time we ask a family to self-isolate with COVID symptoms  we’re essentially asking them to spend 14 days in a cold flat with no food. Very few of our families have a support network to rely on  because they are fleeing gang  drug or domestic violence in other parts of the UK; this means that most left their extended support network behind in Birmingham  Liverpool or Glasgow  in order to live in a place with no available infrastructure to deal with the escalating child poverty that’s been growing since the 1980s. All of our families live no more than 2 days ahead as far as food is concerned; they can’t afford to bulk shop and they don’t have a fridge or freezer to fill with supplies. Many of the young women we work with receive their feminine hygiene products from us as a school via the “Red Box” programme. Without that support  they have NO ACCESS to female hygiene products. Any period of time away from a free school meal means no access to food at the best of times; a second national or local lockdown will be catastrophic. Last time the country locked down (in March/April) we had parents ringing us in tears because they had no income  no food and (very frequently) no electricity to power the laptops that the government provided for remote learning. If this surprises you  it probably shouldn’t  because there are very many schools like ours. However  in this particular case you CAN help if you choose to. Please consider donating to our food bank; no donation is too small. We started with a small bunch of shopping bags  intending to provide a “Lockdown Survival Box” to every family we have to ask to self-isolate. Things have escalated since then  so we’re trying to run a full-on  in-house food bank from our school over the winter. We are THE BURTON ACADEMY (www.burtonacademy.org.uk) and our families need your donations  reshares and general goodwill. We’ll pick it up and run with it from there  yes? X ",True

I have ran a half marathon and dyed my hair pink so that you can laugh and hopefully donate to the cause.      Many thanks and stay safe ! ",True

We are understandably gutted. Not only is Canned Laughter incredibly fun but all proceeds from ticket sales go directly to the local food bank in the area the gig is put on in and right now food banks need our support more than ever: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-51837892    All ticket holders will be offered refunds. But ideally we would still like to raise the money we would have made in ticket sales from these two gigs to help the two food banks they would have supported.    We have set our target amount roughly at 80% of all available tickets sold to both events which would have been £2 560. We will split any money raised from this drive between Eat or Heat  The Waltham Forest Food Bank (Canned Laughter - April 25th) and Euston Food Bank (Canned Laughter: Karaoke Roulette - April 4th)    We thank you so much for your support.

Update: 19th January  2021: I've been interviewed by The Independent about the catastrophic consequences of the upcoming Universal Credit cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/b1789040.htmlTaking this opportunity to thank everyone for their ongoing support - you are wonderful and I couldn't do this without you.        .  .  .        My original message: 30th August  2019    This is incredibly difficult for me to write  but I need to ask my friends  acquaintances and perhaps even some people whom I don’t know  to help me get through the next few months.    I am a domestic abusive survivor struggling to meet essential living costs and the situation is going to escalate rapidly because my employer is deducting more than 25% of my pay from September onwards  to recover two overpayments they made in error for a really long time  without me or payroll noticing.    I’m already on a low income and have been trying to find a more stable job. Until now I’ve been working two jobs  but the temporary one is coming to an end and I will only have my permanent part-time job – where they have persistently tried to dismiss me on health grounds so aside from the overpayment recovery  I just can’t hold on there for much longer.    Whenever I do give my notice or get dismissed  they’ll take the entirety of my final month’s pay.    I live alone but the person I used to cohabit with left substantial utility bill debts at our home that I didn’t become aware of until later  since they lied about having cleared balances. There’s not enough space to move another person in  and I can’t move out right now for financial and contractual reasons.    Because of an active police investigation for rape and domestic abuse that I can’t go into  I’ve already borrowed money for unexpected costs like home security  numerous phone calls to charities and agencies offering professional advice  and private therapy which unfortunately I had to quit.    My chronically poor health has dramatically worsened – I’ve been to a&e twice in the past fortnight because of a kidney infection that didn’t respond to treatment and I had to pawn things to pay for my ongoing prescriptions  but there’s not much of value left for me to sell.    I need to wear glasses but have been doing without for several months since they broke; I’m doing without a lot of things. One of my cats needs dental surgery soon but this isn’t going to be possible.    I earn slightly too much to claim benefits or get free prescriptions and despite years of hospital referrals  I am still fighting for a diagnosis to explain my physical health problems so I’m not currently eligible for any support that could be claimed.    Unfortunately I’m estranged from my parents and I don’t have regular contact with any other family.    I don’t have savings and I wouldn’t realistically be able to repay any further money borrowed.    Up to this point I’ve managed to keep on top of the rent and buy cat food but I have now begun going without my own food  even before overpayment recovery has started. I’m hoping to access a food bank next week but the period I can use them for will be limited.    It’s hard to put a figure on how much help I should ask for  since the only real solution is me finding a job where they’re not actively trying to dismiss me for my chronic health problems  but I am hopeful that if I can just get straight with the money I already owe and raise a couple of months’ living expenses to buy myself time whilst finding a better job  then I can make things work.    Thank you for reading this far; I am extremely grateful to anyone who can donate or share this page. I don’t have many followers and would really appreciate people making this fundraiser more visible. ",True

We also deliver locally to a number of vulnerable residents that are not able to collect the food in person.     We don't ask questions and we provide for everybody.     We are currently serving 100 - 130 hot meals a day. With your support we can do more and feed more people. Demand is extremely high at the moment and we want to be able to continue this crucial support on a longer term basis.

This year has hit everyone hard. So many families  couples and single people are not looking forward to an enjoyable Christmas. Thankfully  with the help of the Cleckheaton Food Bank  Christmas will hopefully be a nicer time for them. I recently set up the Cleckheaton Virtual Christmas Market 2020 on Facebook after the real market had to be cancelled. This is to allow local businesses to showcase their goods  and so shoppers had one easy place to find what they were looking for. I’m not usually involved in the Christmas Market  but I do know their event each year raised funds for the town’s beautiful Christmas lights. With all this in mind  I have set up this GoFundMe to raise funds for both the food bank and the Christmas lights fund  so the stallholders and shopper in the group  and whoever else who wants to  can donate to these great causes. I know times are hard  but even £1 helps!! Please give what you can  and thank you everyone for getting involved. Merry Christmas ❤️",True

To summarize  I lost my Dad to Leukemia 4 years ago and a year later my Mom was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer. I quit my job to care for her fulltime and she died in my arms 11 months later. What an honour and privilege it was to comfort my best friend as she took her final breath. I miss her every day with a constant ache in my heart.    A few months later  my 20 year marriage ended in divorce and so  my 3 sons and myself decided to leave Cape Town and move to the UK. We LOVE it here. The beauty of the English countryside brings so much peace  tranquility and serenity to my soul.    In February last year  I was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer and my operation at Lister Hospital was the day before lockdown began. After 10 months of chemotherapy  radiation and bone infusions  I am cancer free for now  but need to continue treatment and deal with the lingering side effects.    I lost my job at the end of July due to the effects of COVID-19 on the business  and because I have had to isolate with the cancer treatment  have been unable to find alternative employment. Until now that is. Whoop whoop. I have an amazing job offer which is secure  but I can only start once lockdown is lifted and the company is working back at the premises around mid to late February.    As I am here on an Ancestral Visa I have no recourse to public funds and McMillans  other charities and food banks are helping as much as they can. I have survived these 6 months through my savings and the donations and kindness of so many on my previous GoFundMe account.    My last hurdle is the next month and not being able to pay my rent or other monthly expenses and this is where I am appealing once again to your caring  generous and compassionate souls.    It is so hard to have to keep asking and I have had to learn a lot about my pride. Giving is so much easier than receiving. I just want to be able to provide for my boys  work hard as we South African woman do and have some degree of stability after a really challenging year. I pray that soon I will be able to give back and love those around me in the same way that you have loved and cared for myself and my boys.    Original appeal: (August 2020)    My name is Cara Rayner and I came to live in the UK with my boys just under a year ago. I was diagnosed with advanced stage breast cancer which had spread to the lymph nodes in February of this year. My surgery was a day before lockdown began and 8 weeks later  the chemotherapy sessions started  which will be followed by radiation therapy. The chemotherapy has been aggressive and relentless  but a Mama will do anything for her children  so I am fighting with everything in me.    Unfortunately  due to COVID-19  the company I worked at could no longer keep me on  so my employment ended at the end of July 2020. I am still shielding and have another two months of treatment left. Although I can interview for positions  I cannot work until November. As a single Mom  my savings are very low and I need to cover rent  monthly accounts and food for myself  but more importantly  my boys. As I am here on an Ancestral Visa  I do not have recourse to public funds. The NHS and McMillans Cancer Centre have been brilliant with their care  compassion and in helping me find solutions to the various problems experienced with cancer.    I lost my Dad to leukemia 4 years ago and my Mom to colon cancer 2 years ago. This was followed 6 months later by my divorce after a 20 year long marriage. All this prompted our move to the UK for a fresh start and exciting opportunities. I am humbly requesting assistance to get through the next few months with a focus on healing and being able to provide for my family. I am in love with the UK. The ever changing countryside brings me great peace and contentment. My faith in God is strong and He has always come through for me on every front.    Update (September 2020):I am completely humbled and blessed and honoured and overwhelmed by all this support. I did post an update on Facebook about my last chemo session for now. Thank you so much for helping me and my boys and for giving me a sense of peace about the next two months. We have a roof over our head and food and my bills could get paid. As a Mom there is no greater gift. And YOU each made that all possible. I am eternally grateful for each and every pound and the beautiful hearts that blessed me and my boys so much. Thank you thank you.",True

I told my mum I wanted to help get some food for babies children and families who need it  so we thought I could do a virtual bike ride from my house all the way to Chester Zoo and ask people to sponsor me. It is a long way from my house. I will ride 50km altogether. Once I get there I am going to do a virtual tour of the zoo!

To date we have over 400 volunteers who have supported over 150 households on a day to day basis – and done so much more as well  delivering information  building social media platforms  planning interventions to improve security and well being of all residents.     In terms of the support we offer  from shopping services to prescription pick-ups to a weekly check in and chat  everything has been possible thanks to a grant from the parish council  and mostly  the free time and willingness of our volunteers.    As we head to the summer  there is a growing need across Charlton Kings and our wider community. We are committed to keeping our phone lines open  our virtual connections active  and will be running community events. We will also continue our support to shielded households and those needing help to reconnect with the outside world. Within the Friends community there is a listening ear for anyone who needs it  any time.    We stand by to help every family whose circumstances are difficult - to do this we will need a bit of help. There are costs to what we are doing and many of you have asked along the way if you can donate or help to our cause – thank you. This crowd fund will support local people in Charlton Kings whose circumstances make food provision challenging. Every penny will put food directly into the hands of local person who risks going without (young or old). And every penny will be spent with Charlton Kings local businesses; returning your support into our local economy.    Need will be assessed locally by our thriving community groups  or signposted by schools  churches and more – those that can pay do  those that cannot  do not – and no-one beyond the very small core Friends team knows the difference.    Please give whatever you can. £3 is a lunch for someone. £30 is a food box for a week for a single household. £300 is a community BBQ. Please help us  help everyone  in difficult times.    Our funding ambition is based on 1 in every 100 homes needing some form of support.        Thank you              *This is in addition to government school meal vouchers and food bank support. While both are welcome and necessary  there is a long list of need that can fall through the cracks. Having a fund available enables us to move within 24 hours of changing circumstances – and we always provide food  not money  which can be particularly important when children or other vulnerable people are involved.",False

Lockdown has been a real challenge for lots of us  and the economic impacts of the pandemic have hit some families hard. For those families it can be even more difficult to keep up with school work  and almost 6 months out of school may have a huge impact on those children whose families are struggling financially.

Throughout January I'm raising money in aid of THE PONTARDDULAIS AREA FOOD BANK     I'm going to be running/walking 50 miles throughout the next month to try and raise funds and awareness for our local food bank. Now more than ever families are using food banks locally and throughout the UK.     Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020 they have fed over 1500 people providing them with food parcels to last them 3-4 days. Parcels are prepared and distributed on a weekly basis by volunteers who work tirelessly to support those who are in need in our local community. Did you know that just £1 donated to the Foodbank will provide a lunchtime meal for one person. As we enter a new phase of the Covid-19 pandemic and Tier 4 restrictions demand has increased for our service. I am asking for your help to help them continue supporting the most vulnerable among us by sharing this post with your friends. We know that some of you won’t be able to help us at this difficult time but would remind you that any donation however large or small will help us prevent food poverty throughout 2021.    Any donation is massively appreciated and goes directly to the food bank which is based in Canolfan Y Bont. Thank you in advance",True

To compound matters  Nathan has now also been diagnosed with epilepsy.  “A few weeks ago he could have died on our kitchen floor ” says Daphney.  The NHSCT provide Nathan with the maximum allowance of five pull-ups (disposable pants) per 24 hours. My son has these used by lunch! His 12-week supply last five weeks. Due to his stature I have to buy XL adult pants which cost an average of £10 per day.”  Daphney says her financial situation has been so critical  she had to resort to food banks. “The benefit system didn’t change to help those in great need and I had to ask for help from food banks for myself and husband as Nathan’s needs always have to be met  plus he has certain foods he will only eat  which isn’t uncommon amongst autistic individuals. “I have accumulated debt and have no idea if I’ll ever be in a position to repay what I should be paying. We are in temporary accommodation at present and hope to return to our forever home which is under going adaptations for Nathan at present in Jan 2021. I have no idea how I am going to decorate and put floors down when I need so much equipment for Nathan which will help save his life.” Daphney says all the financial and emotional pressures  on top of trying to do her best for her son  is “crippling” her.

The virtual market launched in May 2020 following tremendous support from kind donors. www.localheroes.fadne.org. This initiative is currently completely self-funded and is being built from the grassroots up with the help a number companies  organisations and individuals with experience in storage  logistics  distribution  transport and digital technology who are all eager to see it succeed. So far  the initiative has been a huge success; 120 + orders 180 + boxes 80% + of suppliers have received orders. Our 10% 'Community Fund' has enabled us to deliver 1200 local eggs and 200 litres of fresh  local milk to the West End Food Bank. Currently delivering within a 5 mile radius of Newcastle  we are now looking to extend and deepen our reach by establishing a Local Heroes distribution hub in the Tees Valley. We need your incredible support once again to help us ensure that the 'new normal' includes a critical role for local  community driven food and drink. We will need to raise £4000 if we are to make this a reality. That would take our total to £10 000 which would be an incredible achievement A Tees Valley hub will also allow us to broaden the impact of our Community Fund to assist those in need south of the region.

Volunteers are coordinated via the Eternity Church to help those in need with groceries  post  prescriptions  errands and more.      This page has been created to help with 3 critical aspects of this service.       1. Many people in self-isolation do not have access to cash. So far all transactions are paid for in cash  but this is tricky  and as time goes on  access to cash will become harder.     Anyone needing to use the service can now pay for their transaction here.      2. Well-meaning residents of Downham Market wish to make donations to the food bank  while these are still needed we must be discouraged from purchasing extra supplies  to avoid putting pressure on supermarket stock levels.    Via this page we can support anyone wishing to donate from the safety of their own homes  to their families  neighbours  or just anyone who needs it. This allows us to put the funds into the most needed items.      3. Volunteers are incurring costs while helping  and we wish to reimburse them.     All donations received here will be paid directly into the bank account of the Eternity Church  for the purchase of supplies through a reputable supply chain  and reimbursing volunteers the costs of providing support to vulnerable and self isolating people.

We provide after school food for young people attending Youth First Clubs in Lewisham as well as food parcels for young people and their families from specific schools in Lewisham and Tower Hamlets. We are continuing to support these families in term time and the holidays.     £50 raised will be able to feed 45 children     £100 raised will be able to feed 90 children     £1000 raised will be able to feed 909 children     There is power in our community. Join us.        Why are families experiencing hardship?    Despite the government's U-turn on extending the funding for free school meals over the summer holidays  hundreds of families who needed support were not entitled to the scheme. Young people who used to rely on school breakfast clubs and sports clubs for meals in term-time  and those recently impacted by the financial costs of COVID-19 (which are only increasing)  are more likely to go hungry and become malnourished as school and sports clubs are forced to close or reduce their services over the summer and beyond. This will have both physiological and psychological impacts on the children and their families.     Food Poverty    Child poverty rates in the UK are disgraceful: 700 000 children in London are living in poverty. In Lewisham  37% of children live in poverty and in one ward this is as high as 43.3%. It's deeply distressing that this level of inequality exists in the UK  particularly given that we are one of the richest countries in the world. Don’t know what poverty feels like? See here.    These figures are pre-COVID-19  and it is projected that the number of children in poverty will increase to 5.2 million by 2022. Families from Black  Asian and minority ethnic communities are more likely to live in poverty; which cannot be separated from wider racial injustices and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on the same groups.     A recent survey from theFood Foundation revealed that 14% of UK families with children have experienced food insecurity in the past 6 months.    What are we doing about it?     Legendary Community Club  which was named by Chevrington Odoh from the Pro Plus FC  is a grassroots project set up by some members of Lewisham Mutual Aid and local organisations. Our aim is to deliver emergency food provision to ensure that children do not miss out  for as long as there is a need.     We will make this happen in three ways:    1. Temporary food banks have been set-up for families who require this support during the school holidays  in partnership with local schools and community groups.    2. Kitchens have been set up to prepare nutritionally balanced meals for young people who would normally receive a meal through their local school or sports club.    3. Campaigning and structural change. We know that food charity is not a long term solution. This is not the world we want to live in and we refuse to normalise food banks as a solution to food poverty. This is NOT an inevitable situation.    With this in mind  we have joined forces with The Children's Society  who have been calling on the government to ensure that every local council adequately funds emergency support for families  demanding that nobody is left with nowhere to turn in a time of crisis. For more information about their campaign 'Strengthening the Safety Net' see here  and sign the petition here.    We are also supporting calls from Save the Children and Child Poverty Action Group who have been lobbying for reforms to the benefits system  an increase in the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit by £20  and an end to the two child limit and the £20 000 a year benefit cap which hits families in high-rent areas such as Lewisham particularly hard.     We are working with the Food Foundation who a part of the newly formed alliance who have backed proposals from the National Food Strategy and are working alongside Marcus Rashford to #ENDCHILDFOODPOVERTY    The way our tax and welfare system is designed is a political choice. There aresolutions. We will call on the government and its representatives to be bold  brave and radical in how they approach this problem.     What will we use the funds for?    We will use the money raised from the community to buy food and equipment for the project. We have a host of volunteers  and multiple clubs and schools signed up and ready to go. The project began on July 21st 2020.     Facebook    Twitter    Instagram  ",True

But it's a slightly different one so I'd be really grateful if you could have a quick read and  if you're able to  make a donation to help provide some Light During Lockdown to the kids who need it.     On Monday 20th April most children in the UK would have been going back to school to start the summer term. With the whole country in lockdown due to COVID-19 and no end to this currently in sight  it is expected that kids will miss at least a few weeks of school  if not half a term or possibly even a full term. The schools have all been amazing in sending out resources and setting up online learning but not all children are able to access these  or have supplies at home to be able to continue their learning  or even keep themselves entertained  during lockdown.    With many families now facing financial difficulties  it is not possible for all children to get supplies such as reading books  stationery  craft supplies and workbooks. We are aiming to raise funds to put together packs of key resources for kids who need them to make sure that they can continue their education and  more importantly  find things to keep them entertained during this ongoing lockdown period. We are working with the Potters Bar Food Bank who will distribute these packs to any families that need them.     We are grateful for any donation and appreciate your support in what is a difficult time for everyone. Your donation will go towards making sure that kids are supported during lockdown and they are still able to find outlets through play  reading and writing.    Please spread the word – all donations are gratefully received and if you know of any other food banks that would be willing to distribute these packs in their local area  please let us know via the message function below and we will be in touch.

Due to the pandemic  countless numbers of small and local businesses have been forced to close - with barbershops/hair salons being examples of the businesses that are suffering the most. Now  the normal response for the owner of a business like this would be to take advantage of rate relief  seek bridge funding for the business and also look for financial support being offered to people that are self-employed.    But not Ziggy...        Ziggy has converted the Barbershop into a Food Bank that is specifically focused on helping the elderly and other vulnerable members of the local community to have access to the food and sustenance they need in a time when it may be challenging to make trips to supermarkets or go shopping themselves.    We all know that local businesses like barbershops are massive pillars within communities as they are connected to so many people and aware of a range of local issues. So  who better and where better for a Food Bank to support vulnerable people to come from?        As it stands  Ziggy is not only travelling (on his own dime) to his shop  to the homes of people who cannot make it to his Food Bank and even spending his own money to buy food if he is short on donations from local people that are aware his Food Bank Exists. ALL WHILST HE IS LOSING MONEY AS HE CANNOT TRADE AND RUN HIS BUSINESS AS NORMAL.    So  now we need to support this local hero by helping to alleviate the financial pressure that comes from still having to maintain the utility costs at the shop  the transport costs that come with running the Food Bank and also to help access further food to support vulnerable local people.",True

Free Meals  Full Hearts is designed to bridge that gap and ensure that if your situations changes quickly  or you just need a little help - we're here for you. Anonymously.    I have heard some truly eye opening stories since creating this charitable group - everything from families only eating one meal a day and a couple who hadn't had a hot meal in days to another family who had literally only eaten canned beans and hoops for 10 days solidly because their weekly food budget was £9 to feed 5. It really does put life in perspective.    No-one in our community should go hungry. Ever.    The Reading community has shown time and time again that when faced with challenges or adversities  we come together. The camaraderie  generosity and positivity around us every day is overwhelming.    Feeding yourself and your family is a basic but essential human necessity but unfortunately far too many people in the Reading area are skipping meals and going hungry because they simply can't afford to eat. I can only imagine this must be particularly heartbreaking if you're a parent who is unable to feed your children. As momentum has increased and more and more people have heard about Free Meals  Full Hearts and we occasionally find ourselves struggling to help due to lack of physical food donations. When this happens  I either dip into the reserve pot or sometimes  out of my own pocket i'll buy emergency food shops for families (between £30-£50 per week depending on the size of the family). I have also ordered last minute takeaways for families and bought other essential items such as medical prescriptions and personal hygiene and cleaning products    'Free Meal  Full Hearts' is a anonymous platform where people (single  couples or families) can reach out and ask for food should they need to  without judgement.    If you are able to help  please do. It's massively appreciated - not just by me  but by every family who are committed to helping    Thank You",True

One of the most important changes to our offering is a new emergency food bank  to ensure that those who are vulnerable or isolated are able to access food and supplies during this difficult time.    Donations given through this fundraiser will go towards purchasing necessary items for emergency packages  and supporting distribution to those unable to leave their homes. Each session costs the organisation around £80 in food and deliveries - our target of £3400 would allow us to run the food bank for a full year  through this crisis and the months that will follow.    In this worrying and uncertain time it is crucial that those in our communities who are most vulnerable are looked after. Your donations will go towards ensuring that those in need have access to essential supplies.    Thank you so much for your generosity  and even if you can't afford to donate at this please share this fundraiser with others.",True

Currently  there is a huge need to help support the food banks  as so many people are needing additional help  to put food on the table  which is where the idea came from.    Many people leading up to the bank holiday would be planning where they are going to stay overnight camping or in their vans or on holiday  sadly for the VE-Day weekend that can no longer happen. So why dont we celebrate at home ?    So the idea is simple plan your trip based at home  prepare everything you need to go camping  stay overnight on the drive in your van  a tent in your garden  or even in your house (but it must be set up like a camping trip)  or in your caravan.     So how do we raise funds ?   Donate a minimum of £5 in the pot or the amount you would normally have paid for a night camping at your favourite spot during the bank holiday weekend.  If local to Nailsea  the money will go to food bank in Nailsea  if not to the national food bank network  every £ will make a difference.    Its not just about fundraising  so let's have some fun  go to town decorating your place of accommodation  take pictures  upload them to the Facebook page  use your imagination to have an amazing night or more 'away at home!'",True

As a school  family is important to us  this year has been tough for so many different reasons and the pressures of this current climate are visible to all to see.    Many people have lost their jobs because of the virus  there has been a surge in the number of people becoming homeless and without food.    Being the community school we are  its only right that we are at the forefront of ‘building our community for our community’ we are doing this by setting up a food bank to provide food and essential items for our most vulnerable young people and families within our school and wider community.      More than 2.3 million Londoners live below the poverty line and 33% of adults have skipped meals to save money so that their children can eat.      The Charter School North Dulwich Go fund me page will help us to raise money to purchase food for our most vulnerable young people and families. During the festive period food was donated to the Southwark central community hub.     Our donations page will be ongoing after the new year and all throughout the academic school year and beyond     Food parcels are available on request.

GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw Since We Care was launched as the UK's largest independent food bank and advice and support hub in Lewisham in 2014  we have always ensured that  during school holidays and Christmas  children and the hungry families they come from do not have to worry about putting food on the table. This half term  however  and over this coming Christmas  we truly need your help to feed the new wave of people and pets from across London who are in crisis and will be coming through our doors this winter at Kath's Place  50 Friendly Street  Deptford SE8 4DR.    Can you imagine losing up to 40% of your monthly income? That is the reality for so many people in the present crisis. Rents are so high in our area that people in work do not have enough cash to pay the rent and  probably for the first time in their lives  are having to trade a visit to their local coffee shop for a visit to the We Care Food Bank and Food Pantry for help  advice  support and solidarity. Embarrased and even ashamed  but even more desperate and distraught that their kids are going hungry  mums tell us that they can go days without food  and  on average  it takes people at least a week of going hungry before they finally come through our doors and ask for help. We really do need your donation this Christmas GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw . Becasue we help everyone and anyone and do not focus on one particular group (such as refugees or the homeless) we get absolutely NO national or local government funding or any other type of funding.

Due to the massive shortages of PPE masks and other protective equipment for NHS Front line staff  care workers and volunteers  not just locally but across the country during the current Covid-19 crisis  I have decided to use my time and experience as a creative prop maker in the film industry to help our front line heroes who are putting themselves in harms way every day to keep the public safe.    I want to help the drive to produce 3D printed full face visors based on a recognised format and supply them to staff at out local hospitals  care homes and local volunteers at food banks etc.    My plan is to be producing around 200 visors per week and all donations will be going towards purchasing 2 Eryone 3D printers  filament for the visor frames  clear plastic for the screens  bags for packing and transport as well as wear and tear on equipment.    There is a massive need at the moment and for the foreseeable future for these masks and the more creative industry workers we have making these  the more of our front line heroes will have a chance at being safer in their work.    The spirit and generosity I am seeing as a front line volunteer myself every day simply astounds and humbles me  and I sincerely hope that same spirit and generosity will be shown to this campaign and why I want to do it.

I am setting this up as my brother  who lives in a van  was recently broken into and some of his belongings stolen  most notably his laptop containing the work for his masters dissertation  which was unfortunately not all backed up. Obviously this is irreplaceable  and the damage is done  but if I can make it any easier for him to come to terms with it and hopefully help him repair his home that would be amazing. If I go over the target I will be donating the rest to a food bank. Thank you so much. Tia",True

Although we are trying our level best in treating patients affected by covid-19 in hospital  I feel that there is a lot more we need to do to help these patients in hospital as well as those affected by this pandemic in the community.    Many people are temporarily out of jobs and are struggling to make ends meet. Basic necessities such as food supply and toiletries for many families has become a burden. Families are having to resort to food banks to ensure that their families have something to eat. However  food banks are also in major crisis as they are opening their doors to more people than ever before during this covid-19 pandemic. Provisions that they would normally be supplying per week is now being distributed within a day.     At the same time  many patients in hospital are taking their last breaths of life alone without any relatives beside their side. Families are yearning to see and hear the voices of their loved ones fighting this disease in hospital alone. Yet  due to the highly contaminated nature of this disease  many hospitals are reluctantly having to stop normal hospital patient visiting times. Many patients with a background of dementia and/or Alzheimer's find it very difficult to understand why they are in hospital and what is happening to them. More so  being in an unfamiliar hospital environment without any families visiting them makes it even more difficult for them in aiding their recovery. It breaks my heart that families cannot come to see their loved ones knowing that they are in their last few hours or days of life.     The reason I am setting up this fund raising page is to help both patients and families to be connected in the hospital as well as those affected by covid-19 in the community. The money we raise will be used for two primary causes:    1) To collect enough money to buy food and basic toiletries that can be distributed to local food banks to keep up the pressure of ensuring that nobody goes hungry during this covid-19 pandemic.     2) To collect enough money to buy electronic ipads  phones and phone chargers for patients to stay connected through face-time with their families on the outside whilst they are fighting off this disease alone in hospital.

This business means the world to my brother and he is absolutely devastated to have had to cease trading  particularly so soon after losing our Dad. As well as the business suffering  Chris has also suffered some pretty difficult health issues this year which has really knocked him for six  making dealing with this even more emotional and challenging. For those of you who know my brother personally  you’ll all know what a big heart he has and how much he helps anyone who needs it. He’s helped out local food banks and raised money for lots of charities over the years and now he is the one who needs a bit of help.

The Sikh Soup Kitchen serves the most vulnerable in the name of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji and his message of Langar (free communal meal). They support homeless and vulnerable members of the Community  through their Street Food Banks. The purpose of this event is to raise money for the food banks in order for the team to continue to support the vulnerable and homeless. In the month of July alone  the Sikh Soup Kitchen served over 1320 food packages!!     This is also a venture close to our hearts for another reason. We are undertaking this hike in memory of our dear friend and brother Jaspreet Singh Dhillon  who left this world on 25th July. We feel this venture and its cause will serve his memory well  due to his nature as a genuinely selfless person.     We would really appreciate any donations  little or big - every little bit makes such a huge difference.    Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa  Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.",True

The lockdown and Covid 19 have been particularly difficult on many BAME  low income and isolated families here in Edinburgh. In June 2020 ELREC started a food project to help bridge the gap between BAME people and food poverty and access to free food services such as food banks. This came about after ELREC was contacted by many community members asking for food support due to job losses  furlough  redundancies  and benefits income not being sufficient to live on for many families and also children being at home fulltime.    ELREC provided this work thanks to local funding but this has now ended  yet the demand for food parcels and halal meat for BAME families remains. The work is all volunteer led and these include ELREC staff  board members and our other volunteers who give up their time to help us deliver this project. ELREC provides on average 30 food parcels per week but not only put the parcels together but also deliver them to any family who are unable to collect them.     There are many BAME families within our communities who need and rely on this food support for many reasons but the standard food banks don’t meet their needs. Therefore  ELREC is asking for funds to top up their food support with specific items they need such as halal meat  nappies  baby milk or any other essential items.     Covid has only made matters worse with new data showing that 14% of adults living with children reported experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity in the last 6 months. Four million people including 2.3 million children live in these households. This compares to pre-Covid-19 levels of 11.5% amongst households with children.    The data revealed that 12% of adults living with children reported skipping meals because they could not afford or access food in the last 6 months.    4% of adults living with children reported having gone for a whole day without eating in the last 6 months.    10% of parents/guardians  affecting an estimated 1.9 million children  reported some form of child food insecurity in the past 6 months. Despite people returning to work and children to school  food insecurity remains extremely high for families.    While vital measures like the furlough scheme and Free School Meal vouchers may have prevented the situation worsening  a large number of children are still left in a precarious situation when it comes to securing the necessary healthy diet for them to grow  develop and participate actively in school and society. We want food equality for all  regardless of background.     Please donate what you can and help us keep doing this important work for our community. No child should go hungry and we pledge to use your donations to provide food support all year round  not just term time.

My Dad  James Yule  recently turned 81 and  being on housebound lockdown for 12 weeks  he decided to do Couch to 5k on the back garden path.    (When my friends heard about Major Tom’s 100 laps for NHS  they thought it was my Dad!) Why?  Someone  BP  from a group he’s on  posted on the group page that - even though James didn’t ask for it - BP wants to sponsor him to complete his challenge  and he offered a donation to a charity of James’s choice!    This gave James his altruistic idea - That if people would like to encourage him to do it  by way of sponsorship  and other people can benefit from what he’s doing  then why would he get in the way of such generosity?!    As food and basic health needs are so fundamental/crucial for the people in the world who are most struggling  he would like the raised monies to go to the local food bank and/or care needs in the community.  St. Andrews Foodbank says:    “Those we serve may have lost their job  had a family split up  be victims of domestic violence  or had benefits delayed or suspended. In desperate times we are able to meet their immediate need for food.”  May we extend our human kindness to them.    How?  So  to make it easier for you to give  if you feel inclined  I’ve set up this page.    I will post updates between now and the end of May  by which he hopes to be able to complete a 5km run  actually running  for the half hour that the programme builds runners up to (and do the remainder by whichever means)!    What makes this a challenge  you might ask?   Doesn’t James do the Parkrun?    Indeed  James has done the Parkrun  before  and consistently since my Mum died  a year ago today  20th April.    He also has angina  a heart condition which makes running that bit more challenging for his body. So he will be doing it gradually/sustainably.    His mind/heart  whilst keeping it fit and agile - as well as desiring to support other people in the community to be well and healthy - is determined. How can you help?    With the challenge food banks face in receiving food from their usual sources (church congregations  supermarkets etc)  you giving money to this cause will ensure food banks are stocked  and people who need the support they offer can still access it.

The island is an island of tourism  many of the inhabitants come from the other islands in Cape Verde to work and rely on the wealth of the world for their survival. The island is poor at the best of times  relying solely on tourism. The wages are low but the cost of living is the same as the UK  if not more. Some essential items like Paracetamol can cost an average of £5 per packet  completely unaffordable by the locals. Like the rest of the world  the island is now in quarantine  but this means the islanders are not allowed to leave to travel back to their native islands and live with their families. Without tourism  the locals are without wages and money or financial aids to support themselves - yet are expected to live and survive on next-to-nothing. There have been a few charities set up and have already started to hand out some food to the families  but it's not enough. With majority of supplies coming from overseas and high demand  the local shops have doubled their prices  so food is considerably more expensive and unafforadable for most. My daughter  Chiara often says to me ""Mum  you can't save everybody"" and of course I know she's right. Whilst I know money is tight in the UK and around the world  I just cannot ignore how these locals  who depend on the rest of the world must feel. I feel compelled to try to help them  hence this ""gofundme"" page. The monies will go directly to the locals to buy basic food  of rice  vegetables  water and supplies and distributed to the families in need. I hope you will consider their plight and help  any small donation will help and be a significant difference to those who need it the most. There will be difficult months ahead until tourism replenishes the island again  but they are the most fantastic and beautiful hosts. The islanders of Boa Vista will welcome you and any guests with open arms  today and always - so much you will never want to leave their beautiful island. Lastly  I thank you for taking the time to read this on behalf of the locals whom depend on tourism for survival. Myself  like everyone else really hope we can all return to what was once normal life soon  but in the meantime let’s do our best to look after those who treat us with nothing but love and kindness.

An army of willing volunteers have stepped up and started putting leaflets through every door. This is to let the elderly and people who have had to isolate themselves know  people are offering them help. Help by way of shopping  picking up prescriptions  the newspaper  and much more. This has gone down extremely well and people are genuinely grateful there are people out there  neighbours they know and neighbours further afield  who are there for them.    However we have come up against an issue that you can help us with. People isolated in their homes are unable to get out and get cash to give to the volunteer doing the shopping. Therefore they won’t ask as they don’t wish to offend.

If you can donate  any sum no matter how small  then the fund will give us emergency finances which in turn will enable volunteers to go out and get the essentials for our “at risk” group of people in need and those in full isolation who simply cannot get out even if its solely to collect food as allowed.

The shop supports and celebrates the work of people and artists living with disabilities.     Having lost her job with the closure of the shop since the outbreak of the pandemic  this incredible and inspiring woman  with her own disability  is devoting her time and amazing efforts to help some of the most vulnerable families in the community with Essential Care Food Packs.    Naret is one of the amazing 9 Cyclists riding in the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event to raise money for the Siem Reap Food Bank that her and many other volunteers founded in April to support vulnerable families in need of food support due to Covid19.       Your Generous Donation Today Can Help by Feeding a Family of 4 for 80 pence a Day with the Siem Reap Food Bank.    The Basic Care Food Package costs just £26 pounds  which can feed and help sustain an average family of 4 people for one month!    That's less than the average family of 4 people in the UK would spend on one takeout meal a month!     Donor Fees​ - GoFundMe adds a default Tip of 15% to each donation to help them maintain and improve their free platform. The GoFundme Tip is voluntary and you can change the default tip amount when you donate. The minimum donation amount is £5    There are so many families that need your help more than ever  with your kind and generous support your donations (no matter how much you can afford to give ) means we can help keep their physical and mental health intact throughout this Covid19 Pandemic by helping them survive  whilst offering them a glimmer of hope for the future.     Siem Reap Province - Cambodia    Siem Reap is a beautiful idyllic tourist town just a stone's throw away from the spectacular Angkor Wat Archeological Park in Cambodia.    ""If you have ever been to Siem Reap  or Cambodia in general  you will know how warm  friendly  kind and compassionate the Khmer people are"".    Since the lockdown began  hardly any tourists are visiting the city  with visitor numbers to the Angkor world heritage site down by 99.5%  only 650 people visited the Temple in the month of April  that's 20 people per day compared to around 5 000 back in January.    This situation has created a major problem in Siem Reap. The average wage in the city for people who worked within or in connection with the tourist industry is around $4 USD per day  that's less than $3.50p for around 10 hours work or 35 pence an hour.    The city is more or less totally deserted with literally no visitors  there is no money being spent  no income….nothing…zero. As you can imagine  if you were only earning $4 a day ""in normal circumstances""  then you can probably understand why many families really don’t have any ability to save money to help themselves get through the times when the going gets tough…really tough.     There are many reports of people hearing children crying themselves to sleep at night through hunger.     Many families are trying to live off the land by foraging for fruit and vegetables  frogs  snakes and Rats etc  but the basic essentials that we all take for granted in the UK such as Rice  Eggs  Cooking Oil  Salt and Sugar are products that thousands of families in Siem Reap simply can no longer afford.     Real Hunger exists  in Siem Reap Province  because a large number of families  living at or below the poverty line  do not have enough money to consistently put food on the table.    Job losses  due to Covid 19  have pushed the total number of hungry families to an estimated 20 000. That means as many as 80 000 souls in the Province  are going bed hungry tonight without knowing where there next meal will come from.    Why the Siem Reap Food Bank?    Having lived and experienced an amazing life in South East Asia for over 18 years  I wanted to contribute in a meaningful way  to help some of the most vulnerable people through the ongoing Covid 19 crisis.    After many discussions with my wonderful friend  Christopher Leonard who is currently living there and witnessing first-hand the stone cold reality of the situation  we decided together to spend considerable time researching and validating food giveaway programs currently operating in Siem Reap.    Christopher  spent quality time with Naret and Rick and we could both see that with more money  international awareness and resources  The Siem Reap Food Bank could reach out to so many more families in desperate need of support.    The Siem Reap Food Bank continues to make a real sustainable difference to people in risk of extreme poverty and hunger.     So I decided to volunteer my time to support this incredibly important project and I wanted to share with you why I have chosen this specific Food Bank.    The Siem Reap Food Bank initially launched in April to provide Essential Care Food Packages to people living with disabilities to help them survive the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.     The Siem Reap Food Bank support families headed by or including people with a disability  that have seen their livelihoods disappear  along with the tourists and shops  restaurants  hotels and businesses being shut down.    With the situation continuing to get worse it soon became clear that the Siem Reap Food Bank would not just need to support families with disabilities through this unprecedented time  but any families identified to be in urgent need of an Essential Care Food Package to help them survive.    How Your Kind Donation Helps These Families:    Below is one example of a family the Siem Reap Food Bank is helping every month with a £26 Essential Care Food Package:    Mai Lin  a single mom of 4 children  all under the age of 12  suffered a paralysing stroke about 5 years ago. At the time  she was overwrought with fear that she would no longer be able to take care of her babies.     However  she learned how to make shopping bags from old newspapers and the income generated was sufficient for her to support her family and was even enough to send her children to school. Mai Lin’s income dried up completely with the closure of the Genevieve’s Fair Trade Village shop that sold her products  at the onset of the CoVid19 shutdown.     Along with her first food drop  just before Khmer New Year (April 13th 2020)  came the promise of monthly food drops until she is able to get back to making a living for herself to ensure her family survives.      What's Contained in a Monthly Essential Care Food Package:      We only need 1 000 people from across world to donate as little as as £10 pounds (less than then the price of a few takeout coffees) to succeed in reaching our campaign goal to support 100 families.    Please  help us meet our funding goal by making any donation you can afford.     We know that this is very tough time for many  so if you are unable to donate funds can please help us by sharing this appeal in any way you can via ( social media  friends and family as well as any networks you have connections with) help us create awareness and momentum for this ongoing humanitarian crisis.    On behalf of the families you are helping  thank you for your kindness  you really are making a life changing difference.    Myself and Christopher are volunteering for the Siem Reap Food Bank  with Christopher managing the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event and I'm helping to create awareness for the gofundme campaign.     GoFundMe does not operate in Cambodia. Therefore  I started this campaign in the UK on their behalf with a Funding Goal to support 100 families that's 400 hundred people we can help and support over the next six months.     We project that at the very earliest tourists may return to visit Angkor Wat  in December 2020.    Be kind - Be Loving - Be Safe    Akhun Charan (Thank you very much in Khmer)    Brian Taylor & Christopher Leonard    Important information about how funds for this campaign are being processed & delivered to the Siem Reap Food Bank    I am a volunteer for The Siem Reap Food Bank  I'll be assisting them with social media campaigns to increase UK and international awareness. GoFundMe does not operate in Cambodia. Therefore  I started this campaign in the United Kingdom on their behalf to assist them to help an many families as they can.     I solemnly pledge that 100% of all funds raised through this campaign site are automatically transferred to my UK Bank account and then transferred directly into the Siem Reap Food bank ABA bank account in Cambodia.     HOW DONATIONS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED    Our goal is to make sure the Siem Reap Food bank has continuous cash flow to purchase food & other essential items throughout the coming months  therefore monies will be transferred to their bank account on a regular basis.     The Siem Reap Food Bank Use of Funds: To purchase and distribute essential food and health items for families in need of food support living throughout the Siem Reap province.    Essential costs: To pay for the products being purchased and supplied  plus a few dollars for delivery.    The Siem Reap Food Bank accounting is up-to-date and open to inspection. ​    Donor Fees​ - GoFundMe adds a default Tip of 15% to each donation to help them maintain and improve their free platform. The GoFundme Tip is voluntary and you can change the default tip amount when you donate. The minimum donation amount is £5    ""How to change the default tip amount"" - www.gftv-sr.org/gfmtip.html    We will regularly update our gofundme page so you'll be kept informed on how much you donations are making a significant contribution in sustaining families and saving lifes.    There are so many families that need your help more than ever  with your support and donations (no matter how much you can afford to give ) we can help keep their physical and mental health intact throughout this Covid19 Pandemic by helping them survive  whilst offering them a glimmer of hope for the future.

Many individuals and families have suffered additional hardship during this period and demand for foodbank services has increased significantly over this time and continues to rise. The ending of the furlough scheme at the end of October is likely to result in this demand increasing further as more people are unfortunately likely to be made redundant.    The foodbank at Danebury Drive has been run since the start of lockdown by one individual from her own front garden. Initially this was on a small scale helping a number of local families  but has grown significantly to the point where currently 50 food parcels are produced weekly with an addition 75 individuals access the food on offer for collection for themselves and families.    As a result  the foodbank has become a valuable resource for families on the North and East sides of Acomb. This is one of a network of community foodbanks set up across the city who are all working together to share resources best they can.    The onset of winter means that to continue premises need to found as running this outside with no cover will no longer be viable. Premises have been found at a local church with the offer of a peppercorn rent. In addition to rent funding will be required to cover rent and fuel costs    The foodbank currently receives a significant amount of food donations from Co-op  Fareshare and Morrisons amongst others which is mainly of items such as bread and non-perishable items. Whilst the support has been amazing  this rarely provides sufficient fresh items to support the need  hence the additional purchase of such items mentioned above. Clearly such nutritional items are required for an individual to have a balanced diet  made more important by the fact that many children are supported by the bank.    Up to date the £250pw for fresh items has been covered by a weekly £200pw purchase of produce by a local charity (Kitchen for Everyone York) with the additional made up by the small amount of monetary donations received at the foodbank. However  the current level of support from Kitchen for Everyone cannot be maintained and their support has dropped to £100pw due to a shortage of funding. This level of funding will be continued until the end of 2020.    The costs of powering the fridge freezers and fuel for collection has been borne by the individual running the bank  but this cannot be maintained.    Your help is requested to help continue the service that has been so invaluable for the local community  especially as there are concerns that demand is more likely to increase in the short term rather than decline.",False

" Rooftop Country & Grime Concert","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/rooftop-country-amp-grime-concert,580,580,,2020-09-07,,,0,,"  Hello - I’m singer/songwriter James Riley  and since the start of lockdown this year I’ve been live streaming weekly concerts from my roof in Tottenham  North London  to raise money for UK Food Banks.       We’ve had some amazing moments up on the roof - a country band  a brass band  a choir  as well as coverage from national media including the BBC and several viral clips online.    After 20 weeks of rooftop shows at the end of September I’ll finally be bringing this season of concerts to a close. So to make sure we go out with a bang - I’ve decided to make the last couple shows on September 11th & 18th really special.   I’m going to collaborate on these last shows with Grime MC’s from my local area of Tottenham. As a folk/country artist primarily  this is a really exciting prospect to me. It’s a chance to reach out beyond my musical comfort zone  and to create something new  spontaneous  and which speaks to the moment we’re collectively living through. I don’t know how folk and grime are going to sound when combined - but I’m very excited to find out.       I also feel like it’s a chance to create an encounter between parts of my neighbourhood that might not always have that much to do with one another - and with any luck to foster a sense of togetherness through the power of music.      To pull this off we need to upgrade our live streaming set-up significantly. Every week since the start of April I’ve been broadcasting the shows from my phone - but to capture a concert on this scale  involving a full country band and MC's across 3 rooftops - we need to hire a multi-camera set up  with professional audio. A collaboration like this will also involve rehearsals and musicians fees. I’m doing all of this at absolutely the lowest possible cost I can - but in all honesty we’re still a little over a grand away from covering costs.       So in order to make this a reality - I’m asking for your help to balance the books - anything that you feel able to chip in towards making this goal a reality  will be received with enormous gratitude and appreciation. Anything that we make above the goal will go directly to our wonderful partners #LiveForLove  the campaign to support UK Food Banks  for whom we’ve played 18 shows and counting!       Thanks for checking this out. I feel like we’ve got a unique opportunity to create something really special here before the end of summer. If this sounds like something you'd like to support  and you feel able to chip in  be a part of it and and help us pull off - huge gratitude and appreciation are in order. THANK YOU.",False

The post involved me telling a little about my life since losing my wife Michelle.     She was 37yrs old. She died after the flu virus caused a massive cardiac arrest. She died in front of me in Whiston hospital and the A & E team struggled for six minutes to bring her back. They did manage to do so and she survived a further 7 days before a brain scan shown irreparable brain damage and I was told there was nothing could be done for her. We withdrew care on Easter Sunday 2016.     Michelle (like myself) was a primary school teacher. As such  following her death I have recieved a small pension from her. Every month since she passed awaya I try to use some of the money I receive from her pension to help a cause that catches my eye in her memory. These are usually things like friends running marathons  park benches in memory of people who have died or other things that touch me.     This month my son Billy and me decided we should do something about the number of people in our local area who simply do not have enough food in their homes to feed their families. So we used some of the money from Michelle's pension and the money we would have spent on Christmas dinner (as we have been invited to a friends house) to buy all sorts of 'stuff' to give to our local food bank. We bought tinned veg  nappies  sanitary towels  baby wipes and UHT milk. It felt great doing this. Money well spent.     Someone asked me to post 'our efforts' in the group and the response was unbelievable. It seems to have touched the hearts of many people. 4500+ (and climbing) reactions  hundreds of shares. I was amazed. I have had several people send me money via my paypal account and many more ask how they can help. So I thought as I had perhaps unwittingly created a platform to help people out I would ask for that help via a GoFundMe page. I think that's how people do these things now?    One of the emails I had was from someone who sent me £2 with an apology. 'I am sorry it isn't more.' I wrote back to say £2 will never ever 'not be enough'. If £2 is what you can afford to give then £2 is enough. £2 is amazing. £2 could help turn someone's life around. So yep...I am asking for £2. More if you can afford it...less if I am asking too much. My point is...it does not matter how much. What matters is you did.     So there it is. I am not sure how successful this will be but if everyone who reacted to my initial post gave £2 that would double the amount I am trying to raise. To be fair...how much I put in the box isnt a goal. My goal is to raise as much as I can to buy food and other essential items for people who need it. If it's another £2 then that's 4 packets of sanitary towels...if it is another £200 then that is trolleys full of food. £2000 and I think we may be genuinely changing lives. Something everyone could take pride in.     I would ask this one thing though...I would ask that if you do decide to donate to this fund raising that you do not hide your name. I want to know who you are. I want my son to see you. This is as much about helping me in #makingaman out of my boy as it is helping people you don't know eat. That's an awful thing to write...helping people eat  but its were we are right now. Let's help people eat.     Thank you. ",False

We continue to work alongside Hackney quest  Caribeats and Connecting all communities organisation to provide care packages or a hot meal to families. Our main focus going forward is to provide laptops and other devices to families who otherwise would not be able to access them. These months of enforced homeschooling and now back into our second lockdown period have revealed the many barriers facing low-income families (incl. job losses  food insecurity  housing issues  domestic abuse  family bereavements and many more…). The closure of libraries and community cafes that were previously used for learning  job applications and other resources has further worsened this divide  with many people struggling to access information on where to get help. Many families have been left with no access to a laptop to continue their children’s learning and larger families have struggled to share one computer between parents working from home and multiple children needing access to online learning. since schools began to reopen after the first lockdown  we had still seen numerous amount of families still struggling for devices for their children till current  and even at present through this second wave of lockdown  the list of referrals are rising as families desperately require a device for their children  hence our determination to continue with this project to help families. We have teamed up with tutors around different boroughs to provide online learning for children with the aim for children to be supported with learning they have missed out on. We aim to continue to support families to help make a difference to their lives.     Your generous donation can help make a difference.      £1000 can help support 10 families and their children or 7 families.     The break down per refurbished device is £85 per unit £15 for windows 10 to be installed per device equal to £100 per device and software.    For 10 families this will be £1000 required to raise to offer support.    For a new device purchased from curry's under a business rate of £150 we will only be able to support 7 families with a device.     1 X Amazon Tablet for a family in need (£50.00) Fuel costs to cover the expenses of our generous Community Helpers so they are not out of pocket.

Their neighbour  who is a Leicester City Council tenant  had been using portable generators and it was one of these that had caught on fire which spread to Iqbal's home.     At home at the time were Iqbal's wife and four daughters aged 5-15yrs. Iqbal was at work when the fire broke out and rushed home as soon as he had heard what had happened.       The fire spread into Iqbal's home and the family was forced to evacuate into emergency accommodation. Unfortunately  the family did not settle well into the accommodation due to the overcrowding and stress the family was under. They left the emergency accommodation the following day due to stress and anxiety.      The family stayed with relatives for a couple of weeks in a one bed flat. They knew this was unsustainable with their large family however at least they felt safe. LCC informed their relative that the family couldn't stay any longer due to overcrowding and the family was forced to move out the following day.      The family sofa surfed for a few weeks until they were able to find a vacant property that they could just about afford to rent. The property they found needed a lot of work doing to it and Iqbal put his DIY skills to good use fixing up the property in return for reduced rent. However  it was still 4 months until the family managed to get hot water  heaters and to this day there is still no insulation in the walls.      The effect this has had on Iqbal's family is immense and the young children have been deeply affected by the trauma and chaotic living arrangements  overcrowding and lack of basic services. Iqbals eldest daughter is going through her GCSEs and this whole ordeal has really knocked her confidence and prevented her from focusing on her studies. Iqbals' eldest daughter has been diagnosed with psoriasis and her hair is falling out  doctors' have said this is a direct result of the stress of the fire and the subsequent house moves. The other children are also affected in many different ways.      As Iqbal's home was a private property which unfortunately had no insurance at the time the family is stuck in a real situation where they are unable to buy another home. Leicester City Council has offered to buy the land at less than a third of the market value as long as the family can raise the selling fees. Iqbal is still paying the mortgage and has no additional income or savings to cover the costs of repairs which have been estimated to be £35 000. The house that the fire originated in has now been fully repaired and refurbished by Leicester City Council  yet Iqbal's home is still in ruins and uninhabitable.      Iqbal and his family have been visiting a local food bank at E2 in Beaumont Leys to help them through their situation and have been knocked from pillar to post in their attempts to get this resolved with Leicester City Council which has recently come to a dead end.       If Iqbal was able to raise £35 000 it would mean that his family could get the repairs completed and move back into their home and their children can return to a sense of normality.  ",False

" Family’s and homeless in need ","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/eghp7-familys-in-need,910,9000,,2020-12-06,,,0,,"  My name is Queeny Singh and I need your help to feed families in North West London - families who are in need of support because they are hungry  homeless and desperate.    My story started 4 years ago when I lost my well-paid job  got pregnant and ended up homeless. I was placed in a family hostel in England’s Lane  Hampstead. From the outside the street and the area are super wealthy…on the inside it’s a different matter. I was so humiliated by my new circumstances that I shut myself off from the outside world for a year. How had I lost my home  my job and my old life - and ended up at the hostel? A brutal  run-down  frightening place where I had barely anything to my name and felt so embarrassed to be bring up my baby in these circumstances and environment.    But when I looked up and saw so many single mums  struggling in the hostel I found a motivation to want to help theses families. The hostel should have been a haven for these women who had already suffered so much - often at the hand of an abusive partner  or an abusive regime they were escaping as a refugee. I realised that what these families often needed above all was a lovingly-made hot meal - and someone to show them a bit of care and support - something the system didn’t seem able to do.     I used my redundancy money to cook for families at the hostel and was supporting up to 20 families at a time from my own pocket  but of course my own funds soon ran out.    That was when I started reaching out to local charities and community groups for support and I have been overwhelmed by the enthusiastic support so many have shown me and my efforts. I managed to raise £16 000 for the families at the hostel and have supported 108 families over the last few years.     I saw first-hand how those donations  the meals and everyday essential supplies we got to the families were a life-line for them. The hostel has now been sold by the council and all the families are being moved out - some to far away places where they and their children have no connections or support.    On top of all the challenges I want to help these families face  this year  like everyone else  they’ve had coronavirus and lock down to cope with. Many families are facing the extra hardship of loss of income and job losses  as well as trying to home school in a hostel and having mental health problems caused by lock-down.     So now I really want to continue to support families like them who live in hostels - single mums fleeing domestic violence as well as others who are in need. I want to build on connections and relationships I have made over the last 4 years - with local businesses  local communities and charities who I know will continue to help me carry out this work.     In order to do that I want to register as a charity and purchase a small van. That would mean I could cook and deliver meals to families - as well as delivering other things they might need that I could source for them. I think there are so many people in need: single mums and dads with young kids or with health issues  elderly people  disabled people who often find it difficult to get to food banks or community centres for help  so I would like to bring help directly to those families in my little van.    In order to get this project off the ground I estimate that I need £11 000. I believe with support from the public  local charities and local businesses it can be achieved and I would be so grateful if you could help me to help these families who are so often not seen  overlooked or get lost in the system.

Diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer in the lungs and bones.        Thank you for choosing to read this page.  I don't quiet know where to start  however I know I need to start  for my lovely mum.    Those of you who know Andrea will know she is an extremely kind  caring  funny and positive person  who works as a self employed psychotherapist and counsellor. Those of you who know us  will know me and my mum have always been the best of friends and are extremely close  so this news saddens me deeply.     My beautiful mum was diagnosed with Cancer for the very first time in 2006 when I was just 7 years old. This was Skin Cancer  she had to battle it and work at the same time  such a hard thing for a single mum with two young kids  but after treatment and ops at Christie's Cancer Centre she bravely recovered.     Only to be diagnosed again in 2015 with Breast Cancer Stage 2 a very difficult time for us all  I remember the difficulty  going through my GCSE's whilst caring for my mum physically and emotionally. Financially this time was challenging for us as a family  as my mum has always worked so hard to provide for my brother and I  without any financial support from fathers. When she was diagnosed  the ops and treatment on top of the emotional pain made it so she really struggled to work  but had no other choice. The financial strain was one of the most stressful elements of her illness  and this really shouldn't be the case when you're facing a life threatening illness. We accessed food banks to eat and didn't get to enjoy pleasurable things that normal families do  instead I remember having to spend my wages from my part time job on food for our family. This was an embarrassing time for my mum as a mother works all her life to provide for her family but Cancer takes this right away  she tried so hard  never once giving up or asking anyone for anything.     My mum has always been a big believer in spiritual  holistic and alternative therapies  so she chose not to take the Chemotherapy which the doctors strongly advised claiming she wouldn't live more than a few years if it was not taken. She braved this and stayed true to her beliefs and used holistic  complementary therapies and PMA. Thankfully she was given the all clear from Breast Cancer and she started working as a therapist after completing her degree whilst fighting the cancer  and has never looked back since  she has been nothing less than completely dedicated to her job and gives her all to her clients  ensuring they feel fully supported and cared for.    Those of you who know Andrea for whatever reason she may have come in to your life  I'm sure everyone has the same view of her - a beautiful  selfless  generous and truly strong  inspiring woman. A woman who remains so positive and selfless regardless of what life throws at her.    Jubba  my mums younger sister passed away of Cancer in November  my mum received her unfortunate results on just 2 weeks after. Therefore it is even more of a difficult time for her  and all the family.    My mum first lost her voice last in November 2017. After undergoing investigations she discovered half her vocal cords have become paralysed. This means  if you haven't heard her  her voice is barely a whisper and has been like this for over a year. This has made her job as a counsellor very strenuous. Just before this Christmas  in November 2018 mums year long investigations (biopsy)showed cancerous cell changes in the lungs and that the canceous cells from the Breast Cancer had spread and there is now cancer in the sternum (breast bone) and lower spine  as well as other scattered locations around the body. My mum  my brother and I sat through the dreaded meeting with the cancer specialists on 4th Jan 2019 which we had been thinking of all Christmas  to be told that mums now has Secondary breast cancer which is metastatic and in the lungs and bones. We tried to remain calm however to be told that the cancer is Stage 4 and if treatment is taken then life expectancy is on average 2 years but 5 years at maximum. I struggled to hold it together and broke down in tears. The thought of loosing my only parent and absolute best friend  who has worked so hard all her life to be such a good mum to me  at this young age devastates me.     The doctors spent hours emphasising the severity of this Cancer  and how essential treatment is  and fast. My mum was advised to take a high dosage of IV chemotherapy 2 years intense at Christies Cancer Centre however  she has always been very resistant to such strong conventional medicine and made clear that if she was going to be given 2 years to live  she'd rather live these years to the fullest and not ill  bedbound from such harsh treatment. We have decided as a family and with the doctors for my mum to start treatment which consists of a little less intense Chemotherapy and a specialised medicine herceptin this Friday 11th Jan which she has to take every 2 weeks and go to the hospital every 3 weeks.     Being a single mum she has a lot on her plate  the side effects of this treatment will really rid my mum of her ability to function as normal  and will even make daily tasks a challenge nevermind her full time work as a therapist. Such as breathlessness  dizziness  bruising  stinging  arthalgia  myaliga  insomnia  jaw pain  increased risk of serious infection  lethargy  sore mouth  nausea and vomiting  heartburn and serious energy loss. As you can imagine  trying to hold a full time job down which is essential to live and pay bills would be incredibly hard and virtually impossible.    SO I've decided to set up this page  without my mums awareness to help alleviate some of the constant stress that shouldn't be her main worry when suffering a life threatening terminal cancer.     The generous donations will be spent on things like mums transport to and from hospital (as she doesn't drive). I am hoping that your kind donations will be able to enable my mum to not have to burn herself out and work  as much as she loves her job  it is detrimental to her health  it kills me seeing her so emotionally and physically exhausted  without any other option. **Since donations have been so generous I am really encouraging my Mum to see less clients and spend her energy on her own health  but this is fully dependent on your generous donations  so thank you so much.**    The money will enable my mum to explore alternative therapies and treatment such as holistic treatment which is never funded by the NHS (I know she has a list of many things she'd like to try but simply can't afford). Complementary therapies  counselling so that she can discuss the pain and fear this painful news brings. My mum also used to attend yoga classes but she recently had to finish as she told me she has to cut out luxuries due to money being limited and only based on how much she can work  so I would love her to be able to afford these classes again to help her health. And lastly  the money would go towards trying to find anything she can to help  I know she'd love to eat nutritious healthy foods that will help build her immune system and fight.     Andrea is and always has been the most generous and selfless person  you won't catch her being able to receive gifts or money very easily at all  however she'll easily give you her favourite ring or jumper if she thinks it suits you and you like it! She wont think twice about dropping everything to be there for you if you need someone. And she's never changed.     *Due to such devastating news I have chosen to leave my degree at the University of York and come home to care for my lovely Mum  so do message me if you have any ideas or ways you could help support.*    I will be looking to put on a fundraising event to raise money for my Mum so please do be in touch if you can help/have ideas.     I appreciate you taking time to read this and any donation no matter how small will honestly be so appreciated.    Love  Grace x      ",False
