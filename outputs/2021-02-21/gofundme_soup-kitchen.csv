Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland. Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen feed people seven days a week and will now be able to buy pallets of fresh produce to cook with  whilst the foodbank will be able to use the money to produce emergency three day food parcels.

Islay is a remote island of the West coast of Scotland with a population of 3500 people. The Covid-19 virus has hit island life hard with local businesses small and large having to close. The vulnerable and elderly are following Government guidelines meaning they are isolated in their homes . But  Islay is a strong community and we have over 80 volunteers that are helping to keep people’s physical and mental health strong by telephone befriending  collecting shopping  medicines and being a point of contact. Our newly formed resilience group coordinates the volunteers across the island reaching even the most remotest crofts and houses.        2.    We need a fund to:  Put fuel into the community bus  cover volunteer expenses  supply hand gel and gloves to our volunteers and eventually all households  and to cover admin and printing expenses. As the effects of the lock down persist  then we would like to provide people with a welfare box of essential items including food  kindling and toiletries.   Islay doesn't have access to mainland services so this fund is vital for us to get through the next few months.     3.    We visualise these funds being used in the immediate future for equipment to help the volunteers help the isolated but in the future weeks  we will need the fund to sustain the service and add a possible soup kitchen to enable the isolated to have two hot meals a day.    4.    The community of Islay  as we always do  has shown an excellent community spirit and will continue to pull together to ensure their neighbours who are isolated have everything they need to survive through this pandemic. Islay is resilient and will endeavour to push the barriers to make sure we will be open again for business as usual as soon as we can. This financial support will enable the immediate support of equipment  volunteers costs to be cover  offering hot meals to people at this hard time.    5.    You will be able to measure this through the huge smile and massive ‘socially distanced’ hug which comes through  helping a neighbour  friend or family member who is isolating and cant access their normal routine due to the pandemic. The number of volunteers is increasing every day  people as they have become unable to work have shown great support to help people who cannot leave their house. We will be forever in debt to the massive amount of generosity of time and supplies (physical and financially) from people and businesses. We hope we can open our doors to you all again very soon!

I hope you are all safe and well. Thank you so so much to everyone who has helped us reach our first target goal of ""£3000. We are so grateful and have put this money to such good use  with feedback from our homeless friends saying that the packages are so beneficial  protective and make a big difference! <3 <3 We are now setting a new target to double this money so we can keep doing the important work we are but also diversify to help out refugee services groups in the UK! Lots of love to everyone       Hi all  I hope this finds you  and everyone you love  safe and well supported. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak in the UK  new measures are being taken to limit the amount of mass gatherings and group meetings.    As a result  there is talk of soup kitchens  homeless shelters and regular meeting spots shutting  leaving some of our most vulnerable and at risk groups losing their regular access to designated food  shelter and safety spots; and social activities  leaving them without supplies and more isolated then ever before The creation of out-reach packages with non-perishable food and drink supplies  tissues  hand sanitation/wipes  and masks is essential  to supply to individuals who will now not be able to access these things in the places they could before. Moreover  as a medical student myself  we have been granted a large period of time without full academic commitments  where we have the time to go and make these deliveries and offer the support we can  during this time  where self-isolating isn't an option for some people.    Please donate whatever you can  and share this page with as many people as possible (especially those who work within larger companies and are able to circulate it around there). From there we can start to create packages and begin delivering them. Moreover if anyone has contact with food and/or supply companies who would be willing to ask for item donations  that would be amazing too.

" Hunger Relief Food Hampers ","West Clandon, South East England, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/hunger-relief-food-hampers,1340,1500,,2020-05-06,,,0,,"Hello from Cape Town  South Africa.     My mum and I are creating food hampers for people in the nearby community of Masiphumelele who have no food  and no income at the moment during our Coronavirus Lockdown. The lockdown is preventing any work for them  and its not easy (near impossible) for them to access anything from the system. There are millions of people here who are in the same situation so its very difficult.    We have been creating weekly essential food hampers for 14 Zimbabwean Families who are not receiving anything from anyone. They all have 4-6 people to feed in each household (sometimes more) and they have no income at all coming in. Winter is approaching  and while we sit inside at our warm fireplaces with full tummies  they are going to be in a very different reality. The families so far are all friends with the guy who works full time for our family. He is Zimbabwean and lives on our property  so he is safe  paid and fed well of course. We asked him a few weeks ago if he had friends/knew any other people directly who were going to be really without food  and he identified 11 Zimbabwean contacts. It grew to 13  and now 14 and while we will continue to do this for them  we would like to grow and be able to a) give them a bit more in their hampers to make it a real good week’s supply  and b) to increase it ultimately to 20 families that we can support. Our focus at the moment is on the Zimbabwean families who are having a very hard time accessing some of the soup kitchens/food parcels  and we acknowledge that this a problem for many other nationalities and groups. My mum is from Zimbabwe  so its a cause close to her heart.    We know there are always more people  but if we can just start with a few  then at least that is making a small difference.     This lockdown life is a very different reality for everyone. Lots of us are worried about not being able to exercise properly  worried about eating too much from our overstocked fridges and pantries  burning our banana breads  and getting bored of the Netflix offerings.     Others are literally struggling to survive.     Any donations that we receive will be spent directly on creating essential food hampers  to increase what we are already contributing ourselves. We will distribute directly to these people once a week. (We have organised transport for it to be delivered directly to them  and I receive photos and messages of thanks from all the families)    We have a VERY weak exchange rate here in SA  so I appeal especially to my friends living outside SA- to donate even a little bit  as here it can go a very long way! Maybe its your saving of daily Starbucks/Costa Coffees that you aren’t able to buy anymore  or the savings of not going to the pub :) or maybe is just your generous nature  that will be very appreciated!

Spin City Newbury actually closed before this request was announced as we felt the health and safety of our instructors and students needed to come first. As many can imagine  closing the doors to the business has been very difficult and emotional for us all. Unfortunately this has become even more difficult over the last few weeks when after exhausting all options available to us  it has become clear Spin City will not be entitled to any government help.     Spin City Newbury offers a range fitness classes including Pole  Silks  Aerial Hoop and Yoga  but Spin City is more than just a fitness studio. The studio offers a community where our students feel accepted. Students don't just come for the fitness classes  they come to meet new friends and take time away from the stress that is general life. Many students find that the studio helps their mental health and that the sense of achievement that naturally comes with our classes can help focus on a positive attitude towards health and fitness.     Spin City also has always possessed a strong desire to help the local community. Last year it held it's first summer ball where just short of £3000 was raised and donated to Mind  Berkshire Women’s Aid and Newbury Cancer Care. At the time of closing Spin City Newbury had just started organising this years ball with the intention of beating this huge amount. Along with this  Spin City regularly held Pole and Aerial 'jams' where students could come along after donating money to local soup kitchens/charities.     Katy and the entire Spin City team have always had a fiercely positive attitude  but at the moment the future isn't as positive. As a team we have started thinking of ways that we can adapt in these difficult and unprecedented times to allow us to get back into the studio teaching the classes our students love so much!    There are a few ways in which people can support and keep the studio alive.   There is the Spin City Patreon (Remember to put Spin City Newbury as your studio) This is pre recorded content that you can add together to build your own workouts. Memberships start at £10 per month and the proceeds are helping to support the studio while our doors are closed.   We will also be launching some specific classes which you can join in at home - details are being finalised at the moment  but we hope that this will bridge the gap for those wanting to workout at home but need a bit more motivation from an instructor for the class.   And lastly there is this crowd funder. This is aimed at anyone who would like to help support us  but isn't interested in getting lessons in return.   Anything you can donate is hugely appreciated and absolutely everything will be going into paying for the studio while we all are staying at home  staying safe and protecting the NHS.

Hi all. I'd normally be working on the wards at our local hospital in Newbury (WBCH) but am currently in isolation due to previous medical problems that put me in the extremely clinically vulnerable group. I am therefore feeling a bit useless at the moment. I have done a little fundraising for the hospital as have a lot of people in this area so have now decided I'd like to raise money for our local soup kitchen in Newbury and also The Living Rainforest which due to it's closure to the public during this time  needs money to pay for the food and upkeep of their animals and birds.  People who know me know that my rather unruly hair is kind of like my trademark. I am recognised easily for it. Some people don't know however that I have been completely without hair due to treatment for leukaemia 29 yrs ago and that I have had 2 small trims in the last 20+ years as it takes FOREVER to grow. Hence my entering into this with some trepidation to say the least  that and due to the lock down  my partner Shaun will be doing the honours (Gulp!!).  Any money raised here will be split 50/50 between the 2 beneficiaries. I am raising it like this as The living Rain forest isn't a charity so I can't do it that way.  I hope you will support me by watching it as it's live streamed on facebook (if i can suss out how to do it by then!) as well as by giving generously so that Newbury Soup Kitchen can continue to support the local homeless people and so that the Living Rain Forest will still be there for you to be able to visit Cinnamon the Sloth and the other animals and birds when we are back to whatever ""normal"" is.

From January 27th-31st  I am going to sleep rough for four nights in Glasgow; to raise awareness for homelessness! My aim is to highlight the realism of homelessness  and show others too so we can all build some compassion and empathy towards those who are. I’m going in with no phone or wallet. I’ll be carrying a GoPro and documenting my experience; which @phatdogfilms will help me create into a short documentary-style film.    Lockdown restrictions  quite obviously  make this act a hell of a lot harder but in the reality of it  in a time like we’re experiencing right now  anyone could fall on hard times or bad luck and find themselves homeless. Not just junkies or alchies  like we so stereotypically think.     I understand some people might have arguments as to why I would want to mimic the harsh reality of homelessness  when I can simply donate or volunteer at a shelter.    I could simply do just that.    But I believe by throwing myself into the deep end  into the reality of it and giving everyone else a glimpse into the experience  gives the viewer a chance to relate and some connection  to what I feel is a very real serious problem; homelessness.     And after watching  hopefully  the viewer will feel inspired themselves to donate or volunteer at their local shelter.     Even if they don't donate or volunteer  the hope is that the next time they walk past a homeless person in the street  they might spare some change  offer encouragement or simply just a smile of acknowledgement; rather than moving to the opposite side of the pavement and completely ignoring them.

This is an emergency short-term appeal for donations to help keep the bellies of rough sleepers full during lockdown.    As many of you probably know  there's been a huge effort from local councils to rehouse rough sleepers in hostels around London over the last few weeks. This initiative  though wonderful in its intent to protect rough sleepers from Covid-19  has displaced many many people who called those streets their homes  who relied on a pound from friendly passers-by and who used to community resources in their area to get by. Due to the tightening of government guidelines around health & safety measures  a huge number of central soup kitchens and food distribution services have paused operations. Moreover  the majority of supermarkets have stopped accepting cash in this time.    In times of crisis  a person's core ethics are often exposed  and in the face of this pandemic  a massive number of people have offered their time to cook  prepare and deliver food. We have made contact with a number of hostels sheltering rough sleepers and as we understand it  those people will have no access to food until after the Easter bank holiday. Councils are underfunded and people's bellies are rumbling.    This is a call for financial aid to help our small team buy ingredients to cook some hearty meals for the next few weeks!    ***UPDATE***    This project has massively scaled up since last time I posted the appeal!!!! What started as an initiative to provide meals for rehoused rough sleepers over the Easter weekend has evolved into a daily food prep and delivery service in coordination with various councils across north/east London. The willingness of people to volunteer their time to shop  cook and deliver food has meant we've been able to commit to another 3 weeks operating. The only thing we need to push now is donations. The hostel we are working to support is housing rough sleepers as well as asylum seekers and its really important to us that we can provide meals for both these groups.

They have been exploited  persecuted and displaced for many hundreds of years  and have experienced enormous hardship.    It has become increasingly difficult for the San Bushmen to continue to practice their traditional way of life as hunter-gatherers and now only fifteen active master trackers remain. The situation today is an urgent and critical one; we now have precious time left to help preserve this most ancient way of life and the wisdom they hold.     In March 2020 I will journey deep into the Kalahari Desert to this remote tribe with WildWise in association with The Old Way and CyberTracker . Our small group are all graduates from the WildWise “Call of the Wild ” programme and we will travel to the part of the desert which is the last place in Africa where they still retain rights to their ancestral lands  where they are still able to hunt with a bow and arrow and where the community still remain with some of their traditional ways of life intact.    Living among the Ju/‘Hoansi  we will immerse ourselves in their way of life  experiencing the way they live together in community  raise their children  and going out in small groups at dawn tracking with the bow hunting master trackers.       Why we need this original wisdom    Being the longest continuous intact human culture affords the San Bushpeople a unique intelligence missing in the modern world. They retain a deep inter-connection with the land and it gives them an exceptional and astounding ability to read the earth for stories and track and trail animals for days. This is a continuous tradition that goes back more than 100 000 years  the longest of any human tradition. Their skills and way of life are a vital source of information about human evolution and how to live in deep connection to the living world.    This older  deeper wisdom is lacking from our world right now but through it we might find the distant tracks of some of the answers to the profound questions and challenges the world is facing.    But just when we need it most  the opportunity to experience it is diminishing due to the long-standing persecution and displacement that the San have faced. This has made it impossible for the San to sustain this way of living.    It is my view that preserving this ancient culture that once supported all human life is as critical as saving the last 15 of any species on earth.     The time to act is now.    How the invitation came about    This invitation came from the Ju/‘Hoansi Bushpeople themselves. I am fully aware of the trap which many Western organisations fall into of thinking they know what’s best for other communities. Our primary guide is the renowned anthropologist  scientist and founder of CyberTracker Louis Liebenberg. Louis has been working with the Bushpeople in the Kalahari since 1985  and being a true master tracker himself is highly respected and trusted.    He was asked by the elders of the tribe in 1990 to help them to pass on their cultural practices to the younger generation who have abandoned the traditional ways of living because it is no longer a viable way to survive within the constraints forced upon them. Louis Liebenberg has been tirelessly working with the San Bushmen to ensure that their invaluable tracking expertise is passed on to the younger generation by reviving the ancient practice of tracking as a way to sustain life within the community.    By using free and easy-to-use software designed by CyberTracker  trackers are able to record complex data about wildlife populations and plant biodiversity. By becoming ‘qualified’ as trackers they are able to get jobs in ecotourism  as rangers in anti-poaching units  in wildlife monitoring and scientific research.    This programme of employment creation is vital to ensure that their invaluable tracking expertise is passed on to the younger generation of San by incentivising and motivating them to keep their knowledge and skills alive.      How the money will be used    1 - Money you offer will go directly to supporting the San communities. It will be a lifeline of employment for them whilst also encouraging them to continue their ancient and important cultural practices. This trip will support all the 15 remaining master trackers in the Namibian conservancy for 4 months of the year. We pay them in one week what it takes them 2 or 3 months to earn picking the devil’s claw plant; which is their only other source of income. The tracking work provides a valued source of income which helps preserve their culture and unique scientific knowledge; The Tracker qualification programme in turn helps to support the livelihoods of the village as a whole.    2 - We will pay the other villagers such as the elders & youth who provide valuable knowledge and host us and help us with various tasks around camp.    3 - We also provide financial support through the purchase of handicrafts which provides a crucial source of income for the women as there is next to no potential employment for them in this region. This again supports a wide number of villages as well as helping them to preserve their heritage craft skills. The women will also be paid to teach us to build grass huts for us to sleep in which  like the handicrafts  provides a crucial source of income for the women as well as preserving the knowledge and skill set to build our species first kinds of homes.    4 - We pay an entrance fee to the conservancy  translators and apprentice translators.    5 - Subject to having enough money leftover and if external funds are not forthcoming from elsewhere then we will also provide funding for food for people coming to the TB soup kitchen in Tsumkwe  the clinic is thus able to stay open for longer and provide a better service; we supplement the funding of the clinic provided by others.     I will pay for my own travel to and from Namibia.    My hopes and dreams    Whilst the money raised will deliver vital funding to support the San Bushpeople to continue their traditional ways of life. It is also my hope that there will be other benefits.    My own journey for the last few years has been one of a profound personal transformation and exploration into my own rewilding. It has unlocked for me an intense longing to be reminded of the wisdom that my ancestors held and their connection to their communities the earth. What does it mean to re-wild ourselves and the communities we live in? Is it possible to bridge the modern world and all that it offers with an older  wilder way of being? How can I raise my children with this greater wisdom  in a community that thrives and supports one another? It is my hope that through this visit I will also find wisdom to bring back to my life  my children and the communities I live and work in.     Thank you for reading! Please help in whatever way you can.    With deep gratitude and love     Elena xxx      WildWise    Outdoor environmental education based in the magical Dartmoor National Park in Devon. They offer a diverse programme of courses and events designed for adults  children and families  including the year-long “Call of the Wild ” programme that I attended back in 2017  which is where my journey really began.    The Old Way    If this is something you would like to personally experience and support  then it is possible to join a similar trip journeying into the Kalahari with “The Old Way” which is a year-long program exploring hunter-gatherer life ways which takes place in Devon and the Kalahari.    More about the San Bushpeople    It is thought likely that the Bushmen are the descendants of the ancestral source  from which all modern humans diverged as they started spreading around the world about 60 000 years ago. Their cultural practices date back 100 000 years - all human beings once lived in this original way. It still lives deep in all of us.    Like ll indigenous cultures the San have been subject to long-standing persecution and pressures from all sides. It is extraordinary that the people and their culture has been able to persist. Hunter-gathering by its very nature relies on an ability to roam great distances to source the food they need. Today their ancestral lands are divided up into farms and given away to diamond miners; the small areas left ‘designated’ for the bushmen are not compatible with their way of life. They have been evicted  starved of food and water and hunted like animals. Most San have now been resettled to camps  where disease and alcoholism is rife. It is a far cry from their traditional ways that work in harmony with the land living in community. Something so many of us seem to be striving for today as a way out of the ecological crisis we find ourselves in.    Somehow  against the odds a small number of San Bushmen persist in living according to their ancient traditions. It is thought that the number is now around 10-15 individuals and this number is declining. It is very likely that if nothing changes their way of life will be lost forever in the next few years  a human extinction that will go unnoticed. I don’t want to sit passively to let that happen.    This is why new ways of supporting the San are vital  so that they continue to value their traditional ways  passing them on to their young people so that they might keep alive a culture from which all human life originated.",False

The Ju’/hoansi  the San people living in the Nyae Nyae Conservancy  now face a critical struggle against tuberculosis  a treatable and preventable disease.     This crowdfunder aims to raise money to support local efforts to beat this disease. The money raised will pay for projects which provide vital food  information and testing which is necessary to eliminate TB and support good recovery. The projects had a private funder  but she recently died  and government and NGOs have not picked up the funding shortfall. In addition  the collapse of tourism in the Nyae Nyae due to COVID19 has caused a major fall in local income  meaning this crowdfunder is more important than ever.       The San culture is under threat from many directions  but TB is particularly dangerous. It is the leading cause of death from any infectious disease worldwide and there are four strains of TB in the region. We’re working with organisations and doctors on the ground the Nyae Nyae to make sure this money gets to the right people at the right time.       The priority is to provide food for recovering TB patients as eating regular good food is essential for the treatment to work. Government funding pays for medicines distributed by the clinic in Tsumkwe  which serves the whole of the Nyae Nyae. However  this funding does not provide accommodation or food. There is a separate soup kitchen project which provides nutritious meals twice a day in Tsumkwe to TB patients  but it is facing massive funding cuts. The soup kitchen urgently requires £500 a month to continue to provide this vital service.     Funding is also desperately required for an outreach team that carries out testing and education in the remote villages. As we've learned from COVID19  testing is an important part of controlling infectious disease. The outreach team can identify the disease in the early stages  which limits the spread of infection within the villages. This outreach team requires £300 a month to operate.    Since TB flares up when people are malnourished or otherwise immuno-compromised  the longer term aim is to tackle food security. One vision to do this is to support the San to create gardens and food forests within each of the 39 villages in the Nyae Nyae Conservancy. Seeds  fencing materials and tree saplings are needed to establish a garden in each of them. If we exceed our fundraising target  the additional money will be put towards these gardens and forests.     If you are able to help fund this work in the longer term  please get in touch by contacting Caspar through the link below.       More on the San    The San people of the Kalahari are the last trace of our deep ancestry  our oldest cousins who never left Africa. Their territories span Botswana  Namibia and South Africa. In the last few centuries the nomadic lives these people led have been dramatically transformed through waves of colonialism and marginalisation that has put pressures on their land  and many are now settled in villages or only semi-nomadic.        Amongst the San are some of the best trackers and hunters in the world. Men and women can still walk into the bush with their digging sticks and come out with forage hides laden with food. However  their shrinking territory and the fact that they are settled in villages  means living off foraging and hunting alone is not enough. Money  necessary to supplement limited hunting and foraging  is hard to come by. The main sources of income are searching in the desert for the Devil’s Claw plant and tourism. With COVID19  it will be a long time before tourism returns to the Kalahari.     About us    We are a group of people passionate about supporting the Ju'/hoansi as many of us have spent time with them through the Old Way and / or Wildwise over the last few years. There is so much we can learn from a culture as old as humanity itself and we would love to support the people who shared so much with us. Your kindness means the world to us  thank you.

As an independent volunteer here in Greece the most important thing I've been able to do is provide aid in crisis situations exactly at the time it was needed. That is why it is very important for independents to be here. To fill in gaps. You see NGOs  because of the way they are set up  although they have the funding and the resources  their hands are tied by a million different rules and regulations  which stops them from being able to react quickly to crisis.         But independent volunteers work differently. They arrive  they assess the needs and they provide direct aid as and when it is needed. This can mean doing a midnight run to the super market and buying 2000 croissants because the borders are closed and 80 buss loads of hungry and cold people are stuck at a gas station. Or driving a van full of equipment  for 6 hours   to set up a portable soup kitchen next to said gas station. It means arriving at 4am with tents and sleeping bags  making sure children and vulnerable people don't sleep in the open air in the middle of winter. It means being able to fly a very sick child to a mainland hospital in the middle of the night. And so much more.         But for this to happen we need funding. Money that can be accessed immediately. We need to be able to respond quickly. And we need your help. After nearly 3 months here I have had the absolute privilege of meeting and working with some of the most incredible human beings for whom personal safety and comfort is secondary to the welfare of others. They don't stop. They work 17 hour shifts in the cold or the heat  at the beaches  at the borders  in the towns. They pitch tents in the middle of a field with a gas cooker and make tea or soup  anything to provide warmth and comfort. They take over abandoned buildings and renovate it and turn it into safe spaces where people can eat and sleep and get much needed relief from their relentless suffering.

This will be my solo challenge to raise funds for this rewarding project.     The most severe and visible form of homelessness is rough sleeping. Official estimates show more than 4 000 people are sleeping rough in England a night. This is set to increase due to the financial pressures from the current pandemic. Many have been placed into temporary accommodation since the last lockdown  but there has also been a small rise of unaccounted street homeless throughout the UK.     Current statistics on homelessness show –     7% have served in the armed forces.     33% of females have fled domestic violence and became homeless.     45% have been diagnosed with a mental health condition.     43% need support for substance misuse.     12% have been in the care system.

They have been exploited  persecuted and displaced for many hundreds of years  and have experienced enormous hardship.    It has become increasingly difficult for the San Bushmen to continue to practice their traditional way of life as hunter-gatherers and now only fifteen active master trackers remain. The situation today is an urgent and critical one; we now have precious time left to help preserve this most ancient way of life and the wisdom they hold.     In March 2020 I will journey deep into the Kalahari Desert to this remote tribe with WildWise in association with The Old Way and CyberTracker. Our small group are all graduates from the WildWise “Call of the Wild ” programme and we will travel to the part of the desert which is the last place in Africa where they still retain rights to their ancestral lands  where they are still able to hunt with a bow and arrow and where the community still remain with some of their traditional ways of life intact.    Living among the Ju/‘Hoansi  we will immerse ourselves in their way of life  experiencing the way they live together in community  raise their children  and going out in small groups at dawn tracking with the bow hunting master trackers.       Why we need this original wisdom    Being the longest continuous intact human culture affords the San Bushpeople a unique intelligence missing in the modern world. They retain a deep inter-connection with the land and it gives them an exceptional and astounding ability to read the earth for stories and track and trail animals for days. This is a continuous tradition that goes back more than 100 000 years  the longest of any human tradition. Their skills and way of life are a vital source of information about human evolution and how to live in deep connection to the living world.    This older  deeper wisdom is lacking from our world right now but through it we might find the distant tracks of some of the answers to the profound questions and challenges the world is facing.    But just when we need it most  the opportunity to experience it is diminishing due to the long-standing persecution and displacement that the San have faced. This has made it impossible for the San to sustain this way of living.    It is my view that preserving this ancient culture that once supported all human life is as critical as saving the last 15 of any species on earth.     The time to act is now.    How the invitation came about    This invitation came from the Ju/‘Hoansi Bushpeople themselves. I am fully aware of the trap which many Western organisations fall into of thinking they know what’s best for other communities. Our primary guide is the renowned anthropologist  scientist and founder of CyberTracker Louis Liebenberg. Louis has been working with the Bushpeople in the Kalahari since 1985  and being a true master tracker himself is highly respected and trusted.    He was asked by the elders of the tribe in 1990 to help them to pass on their cultural practices to the younger generation who have abandoned the traditional ways of living because it is no longer a viable way to survive within the constraints forced upon them. Louis has been tirelessly working with the San Bushmen to ensure that their invaluable tracking expertise is passed on to the younger generation by reviving the ancient practice of tracking as a way to sustain life within the community.    By using free and easy-to-use software designed by CyberTracker  trackers are able to record complex data about wildlife populations and plant biodiversity. By becoming ‘qualified’ as trackers they are able to get jobs in ecotourism  as rangers in anti-poaching units  in wildlife monitoring and scientific research.    This programme of employment creation is vital to ensure that their invaluable tracking expertise is passed on to the younger generation of San by incentivising and motivating them to keep their knowledge and skills alive.        How the money will be used    1 - Money you offer will go directly to supporting the San communities. It will be a lifeline of employment for them whilst also encouraging them to continue their ancient and important cultural practices. This trip will support all the 15 remaining master trackers (three of whom are women!) in the Namibian conservancy for 4 months of the year. We pay them in one week what it takes them 2 or 3 months to earn picking the devil’s claw plant; which is their only other source of income. The tracking work provides a valued source of income which helps preserve their culture and unique scientific knowledge; The Tracker qualification programme in turn helps to support the livelihoods of the village as a whole.    2 - We will pay the other villagers such as the elders & youth who provide valuable knowledge and host us and help us with various tasks around camp.    3 - We also provide financial support through the purchase of handicrafts which provides a crucial source of income for the women as there is next to no potential employment for them in this region. This again supports a wide number of villages as well as helping them to preserve their heritage craft skills. The women will also be paid to teach us to build grass huts for us to sleep in which  like the handicrafts  provides a crucial source of income for the women as well as preserving the knowledge and skill set to build our species first kinds of homes.    4 - We pay an entrance fee to the conservancy  translators and apprentice translators.    5 - Subject to having enough money leftover and if external funds are not forthcoming from elsewhere then we will also provide funding for food for people coming to the TB soup kitchen in Tsumkwe  the clinic is thus able to stay open for longer and provide a better service; we supplement the funding of the clinic provided by others.     I will pay for my own travel to and from Namibia.    A thank you    I would love to offer you something tangible in return for your support. Therefore  I will be offering the following thank you for your donations:    - £50 or more: An invitation to an exclusive  small-group gathering around the campfire with me where I will share songs and stories from the desert. Date and venue TBC (most likely Gloucestershire)    - £10 or more: An invitation to a live Q&A (webinar/Facebook live) session with me on return from the expedition    My hopes and dreams    Whilst the money raised will deliver vital funding to support the San Bushpeople to continue their traditional ways of life. It is also my hope that there will be other benefits.    My own journey for the last few years has been one of a profound personal transformation and exploration into my own rewilding. It has unlocked for me an intense longing to be reminded of the wisdom that my ancestors held and their connection to their communities and the earth. What does it mean to re-wild ourselves and the communities we live in? Is it possible to bridge the modern world and all that it offers with an older  wilder way of being? How can I share this passion and this greater wisdom with others that crave a deeper connection with life? It is my hope that through this visit I will be able to bring back some of this wisdom and share it with you.    Thank you for reading! Please help in whatever way you can.

They offer a diverse programme of courses and events designed for adults  children and families  including the year-long “Call of the Wild ” programme that I attended back in 2017  which is where my journey really began.    The Old Way     If this is something you would like to personally experience and support  then it is possible to join a similar trip journeying into the Kalahari with “The Old Way” which is a year-long program exploring hunter-gatherer life ways which takes place in Devon and the Kalahari.    More about the San Bushpeople    It is thought likely that the Bushmen are the descendants of the ancestral source  from which all modern humans diverged as they started spreading around the world about 60 000 years ago. Their cultural practices date back 100 000 years - all human beings once lived in this original way. It still lives deep in all of us.    Like all indigenous cultures the San have been subject to long-standing persecution and pressures from all sides. It is extraordinary that the people and their culture has been able to persist. Hunter-gathering by its very nature relies on an ability to roam great distances to source the food they need. Today their ancestral lands are divided up into farms and given away to diamond miners; the small areas left ‘designated’ for the bushmen are not compatible with their way of life. They have been evicted  starved of food and water and hunted like animals. Most San have now been resettled to camps  where disease and alcoholism is rife. It is a far cry from their traditional ways that work in harmony with the land living in community. Something so many of us seem to be striving for today as a way out of the ecological crisis we find ourselves in.    Somehow  against the odds a small number of San Bushmen persist in living according to their ancient traditions. It is thought that the number is now around 10-15 individuals and this number is declining. It is very likely that if nothing changes their way of life will be lost forever in the next few years  a human extinction that will go unnoticed. I don’t want to sit passively to let that happen.    This is why new ways of supporting the San are vital  so that they continue to value their traditional ways  passing them on to their young people so that they might keep alive a culture from which all human life originated.",False

We are providing food parcels for those individuals who are most in need  to help keep children fed and parents in good health through these hard times. Food and water will be sourced from local fishermen  farms  and markets on the island. This will ensure that your money stays in circulation on the island so it can carry on helping families across Galapagos. Originally  we planned to open a soup kitchen but the donations were not big enough to allow for this to happen so we changed your approach to ensure that food Parcels could be sent immediately to those families and individuals with the greatest need. We are now working with support groups and communities on the island to identify who has the greatest need of this support. What is in the food parcels? Rice Sugar Potatoes Onions Flour Salt Lentils Noodles Cans of tuna Can of sardines Oil Margarine Chocolate casing Why do we need your help? My name is Kat Palmer and I live in England. I was in Galapagos throughout February and March as the Coronavirus pandemic hit. We were evacuated from the islands on one of the last planes to leave the islands on 16th March and behind us we left a community in turmoil. Whilst I was in Galapagos I made friends with some of the locals  and when I asked them if they were OK their response brought tears to my eyes. ""we are terrified  we feel so helpless""  they said ""There is no work. How do we feed our children?"". It was a shock to find out that the cost of food and water on the islands was double the price it would be on the mainland. In England we can just take water from the tap but in Galapagos the water is not drinkable so they have to buy bottled water. They have no choice  and as savings are used up each mouth full of water becomes very precious. I had to do something to help them and so with the help of my friend Patricio in Galapagos (I call him Pato) we came up with an idea to use crowdfunding on GoFundMe to help carry the islanders through these hard times. As Coronavirus has swept the globe Ecuador's port city of Guayaquil (the gateway to the Galapagos Islands) has been one of the hardest hit places in South America. All tourism has ceased to these magical islands where Charles Darwin came up with his theory of evolution. No tourists are able to visit the islands and with no end to these restrictions in sight  The Galapagos Islands are now suffering catastrophic economic damage as lockdown has halted all tourism. For 90% of resident’s tourism was their only source of income and now they have been left with nothing. (see pictures) Before Coronavirus After Coronavirus Your money will provide vital food to the residents of Galapagos so families can stay healthy until their economy recovers enough for them to rebuild their livelihood once more. Locals are struggling to make ends meet; with no income they have no money to buy food and families are going hungry. ¿Qué haremos con el dinero?

She has also lost a good part of her short term memory. Joan is confined to a wheelchair as she can not walk on her own. She has a caregiver who comes daily to care for her.     Sadly Joan has just been forced into homelessness and is temporarily living in a motel in Kelso  Washington. This happened just after Christmas because she was short rent money but didn’t want to ask for help as it was Christmastime. Sadly she was evicted and didn’t realise the implications and the cruelness the landlord would show them. Now she will have great difficulties finding a landlord that will accept her because that eviction is on her record.     My nephew Joshua  who has learning difficulties  also lives with my sister. Joshua takes care of his mom at night when her caregiver is not able to be there. He also has a job at the local McDonalds that he's very proud of as it's so hard for him to get a job with his difficulties. Unfortunately  because Joshua is an adult  he was made to be on the lease for the apartment as well. This means unfortunately that the eviction is on his record too.     Joshua’s young son  my great nephew Oliver  lives with them as well. He’s a bright kid that is the star football player for his school. Oliver helps look after his grandma too and he just adores her.     The three of them are sharing a handicap room and sadly the boys are sleeping on the floor.     Becoming homeless  let alone my sisters stroke  has affected them all something terrible and they are stuck! They are good people who’ve never drank  smoked or been anywhere near drugs.   My sister and nephews are the kind of people who would give you the shirt off their backs.     My sister was a stay at home grandma. She’s raised my great nephew Oliver when he was abandoned by his mother at 3 months old.   Joan used to make cookies and bake all the time and boy could she crochet! Her blankets and scarves were so beautiful!   She also used to volunteer at a local church who ran a soup kitchen. That came to an end when she fell off a pallet in 2014 whilst volunteering and broke her hip! Only a few months after this she had her stroke. Joan has had a horrible run of luck and I just want to turn it around for her and really show her how much everyone cares!     My sister receives very little help from the state and doesn’t get housing just because she’s a disabled stroke victim as most would assume. My great nephew is obviously a minor but the government doesn’t provide quick assistance for this reason either unfortunately.     They have applied to the local housing authority for subsidised housing but the waiting list is two years! Things are so different in the USA compared to the UK. The government WILL NOT help them!     We have exhausted all efforts  called all the shelters and spoken to the local churches. It seems so many people are in this position in the USA that no one has the ability to help!     Please help raise money for Joan and my sweet nephews to have a safe place to stay for the time being. The money will be going towards keeping them in the handicap room for now so my sister can be comfortable and close to her caregiver. Any additional money will be saved for a deposit for an appropriate home for them and any essentials they require.     If anyone knows of a landlord in Kelso or Longview that is willing to help them please let me know. We really need a miracle to happen! With your support and spreading the word hopefully we can find something for them soon!     Anything you can give now will be much appreciated. Even £5! Please share with everyone you know! Thank you all so much in advance!",False

What it means to buy this vehicle: • Fuel consumption is almost half. • The maintenance cost is low. • We can get to the local schools for educational days and projects. • We can get to the soup kitchen on a Saturday to feed the foster children. • It means we can go on a snake call out to rescue snakes from people’s houses and help to educate the community. • We can go on animal call outs for injured and orphaned animals. • We can get animals to and from the local vets if needed. • We can release the animals when they are strong enough or wild enough on Ukuwela conservancy. • We can carry out our field research to help protect the animals on Ukuwela and the surrounding properties • We can take equipment to build and maintain pre-release enclosures and make sure that it is safe and suitable for the animals. These points are all important and mean much in the conservation world. With just a small donation you can help us continue all our hard work.

The building is situated immediately west of this historic town centre  within the historic town of Bedford; well known for being the home to the likes of preacher and writer of the acclaimed book ‘Pilgrims Progress’  John Bunyan  Edward the Elder’s first known castle fortress and Barony of Bedford.     The building is located on the A6 (Clapham Rd) which is easy to get to regardless of which route into Bedford you are taking. The building is placed between St Martins Church and Livingstone School as well as being a short and enjoyable walks to the beautiful Bedford Park.    Use of the Building    The intention for the building is primarily to be used as a place of worship for ‘all nations’ within the community of Bedford. F.C.C will also play host to a number of community initiatives such as a children’s and Youth activity centre  Meet & Chat Coffee Mornings  Soup Kitchen  OAP’s luncheon activity day  educational activities as well as a Performing Arts initiative. Once complete  the F.C.C building will stand as a beacon in Clapham road Bedford  bringing a fresh look to this area of Bedford.    How far have we come?    St Martins Church  after being unable to keep up with the maintenance of this building  eventually sold it to the council  which planned to turn it into a pre-school in coalition with Livingstone Primary School  which is its neighbouring building to its right. After promised money from government to improve schools were withdrawn  the council had no choice but to put the church hall back on the property market.    Being on the market for two years  we made some inquiries and after much debate about the condition of the property and its value  we managed to decrease the asking price from £250 000 to £70 000. We had managed to raise £82 000 and we were able to buy the property in 2013 cash for £70 000. At the end of 2015 we finally received planning permission for the refurbishment  partial rebuilding and extension of the old St Martin’s Church Hall  to create a significantly new  multipurpose community centre.      The official plans can be seen at the Borough Councils Planning Portal here:     http://edrms.bedford.gov.uk/PlanningBrowse.aspx?id=seZayNzlK66rbT8o9SOTWQ%3d%3d    Since obtaining Planning Permission  we have focussed on...    1. Raising as much funds as possible (£53 000 to date)    2. Putting a design team together  this consists of an Architect  Quantity Surveyor  Structural Engineer  Electrical & Mechanical Engineer and a Principle Designer (CDM) (as well as having integral input from all energy and power supply companies. This team alone will cost £16k circa.     3. Obtaining 4 builders quotes all ranging from between £500k to £1.5million    4. Writing to Funding Organisations  Churches and Individual Donors.     The design team are working hard to have the “Working Constructions Drawing” (Building Regs Plan) completed by Christmas 2016 to tender in order to Start work within the first quarter of 2017.    Among the core services we offer our community  we also aim to provide a range of high quality and cost effective services to the local community  with the potential to develop new services in response to the changing needs of the community. The many types of skill sets available through FCC affiliation as well as the many needs those skills sets aims to reach on a weekly basis  leaves us with no choice but to build upon what we already have  bringing what we do using four different location  under one roof.    Another part of our project that we are excited about involves working in partnership with Bedford Borough  local doctor surgeries and community services to pilot a volunteering ‘Community Health Champion’ service. Active ‘Health Champion’ models in action combined with the spiritual and emotional support churches offer across the UK have proven to be very successful; our aim is once the project has matured and gained the local communities trust  we will run a 24 hours support service for the emotional and mental needs of beneficiaries at the time their crisis occurs. Crisis can happen at any time  in the same way an individual with a broken leg or a heart attack shouldn't have to wait to see a doctor during office hours  those with emotional and mental crisis should have the same opportunities.     Mental and emotional health should have the same amount of care  thought and urgency  as physical health. As our building sits in one of the lowest deprived areas in the country  we aim to notably promote this unique service in this particular LSOAs (Lower Layer Super Output Area) which is among the 0-20% most deprived areas in Bedford and Kempston town.

TB promotes social inclusion and empowers individuals by making members feel valued  enabling them to share their skills with others learning new skills themselves.    Partnerships and effective community involvement is vital to ensure our project services and activities are a success. Involving local residents  particularly disadvantaged and vulnerable communities  in helping to design and deliver our projects and services will help build confidence  ownership and a sense of community. We are in the process of consulting with local council and professional organisations  such as TB UK regarding planning  implementation and sustaining our community service as well as contacting other similar projects to share and learn from their experience.

Dispite several opportunities with other companies guiding here non came to anything and have been ""making do"" ever since.     Realising guiding here was my only way I could earn I tried to start myself from the bottom. I had a large loan from a friend for some tackle but no where near enough as winter demanded a boat and a 4x4 to move when needed.     November 2019 I had given up  kit had broke  inflatable boat stolen and sun damage to bivys there was no hope to continue.     December I returned to the uk  in hope to start a fresh life in Hereford and hopefully build a relationship with my kids and recently born grandson. First I needed a home and after discovering most my friends turned heroin or crack cocaine users my only option was council. After waiting several weeks with no money and sleeping rough I was told I had no local connections and they were unable to house me my home town where I grew up  my kids live I had no support at all.     Sleeping in a multi story car park for several more weeks I really did hit rock bottom  not only mentally but physically. Sharing my evenings begging on the streets and drinking with other homless I really started to wake up to life and realise it really is what you make of it. I fought my depression daily  tried to help others and spent most weekends talking to street pastures and discussing the possibilities of helping others. I knew more needed to be done but didnt know how. I spent the next month on the streets  engaging with all agencies  eating at the soup kitchens  contacting charity's and socialising with drug and alcohol abusers on a daily basis.     It became clear I needed to help myself before I could help others...  Also there was no future in Hereford for me  the dream of my kids visiting every sunday for dinner was never going to happen and needed to find my happy place.     During the time some local spainish people had kept in touch and I never realised how much they cared   It's like having a real family     The banks of the river ebro.  Catching or not  rain or unbearable heat the only place I really felt happy was there. With flights cheap and the offer of help and a lift to the airport i booked my return for march 16th. I spent the next 2 weeks saying my goodbyes to everyone  some I hadn't seen in years and some I know I may never see again.     Look down coming  no one thought I would make it but I caught the last flight out the UK  all 6 of us on the plane and i returned to riba-roja. Strange at first with nothing open  unable to go anywhere but I was used to being alone and on the bank so got my head down and into my fishing and had myself some lovely carp including a new PB common  I've named ""lockdown"" at 48lb.    Guiding is a young mans game  something i wont be able to do forever (but will continue until I achieve my goal) and when i first got stuck here i came up with an idea of a ""syndicate"" somewhere you dont have to be guided(optional)  somewhere you can take the whole family  somewhere you can return to year after year with each year things improving and getting better. Private  safe and secure. Storing for your own fishing tackle available. First class accommodation  electricity and running water.     Now Its time to make it happen.    I've been very lucky here and have 1 piece of land which I rent (struggling with payments atm) with the go ahead for everything I want aswell as electric on site.     I also have 2 other pieces of land owned by locals I'm able to make swims on when ready after years of talks and helping out locals and earning trust.    I have also found a 2 bed property on the banks of the ebro with access for 4 swims for sale.... a dream maybe but we will see where this goes before rulings it out.     Theres several options available for me but my preference would be to buy rather than build on rented land. The rented land would be available to buy also at the right price.     I thought it was impossible through gofund me to achieve this kind of money until someone pointed out the amount of fb friends I have  followers on my traveling angler page.     If 4950 friends donated £5 each the plans to build on the rented land will go ahead.     If 4950 friends donated £15 each I would purchase the land and house and commence building there.     I know many wont be able and some may give less but anything you can do would be appreciated and put to good use in building this dream.     Please feel free to share on your fb with your friends and fellow fishermen and Fisher ladies.     Syndicate prices will be £500 per year per person with 25 members which gives you 2 weeks fishing per year on the syndicate itself but other weeks available on the other swims. (£7500 of which is used to improve syndicate each year and help with up keep and maintenance) If you should wish to become a member and donate £500 please pm me so correspondence can commence and all details taken.

The threat of Covid-19 is still here and will not disappear immediately. The UK currently has the second highest death rate from this virus in the world  so we need to make sure that we are still acting responsibly to protect ourselves and others. Not forgetting the fact that we are still uncertain as to whether a second peak will befall us  which has been the case in previous fatal viruses. As everyday life continues  we just will need to adapt to a new way of operating and interacting with those around us.    Bridging the gaps:    As lockdown eases  it is becoming more and more apparent that there are sectors that do not fall under the government’s priority list. These keyworkers are required to go back to work to support the economy and keep their families thriving. We would like to help them achieve this without any additional anxieties.    Approximate pricing for PPE is as follows:        Standard surgical mask £50 for 50    KN95 Mask £120 for 50    Disposable gloves (med grade) £45 for 100     Shoe covers £25 for 100 pairs    Disinfectant wipes (med grade) £25 for 1000    Antibacterial gel (alcohol based) £90 for 5 litres    Protective goggles £15.00    Face shield £10    Desk screen £50 - £150 (size depending)        What will we be doing?    With funds raised  we will be providing the ‘forgotten key workers’ with PPE so that they feel secure in their place of work. These include supermarket staff  transport workers  support workers  social care staff  delivery and logistic staff including food/sustenance providers who have had no choice but to continue working to support us and their families. They are often overlooked but have a major impact on how well our society continues to operate.    Who are we?    We are “can't STOP fashion”  a fashion with a purpose movement with a remit to address the issues at the forefront of society. This is accomplished through the collaboration of undiscovered and underrated talent from the fashion  media and entertainment industries. We hope to bring pressing social issues to audiences who often do not to indulge in mainstream media platforms  alongside showcasing these up and coming creatives with a purpose.        Quarantine Fashion Show:    Promotional Trailer Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDcel5r01jQ    To kickstart this PPE campaign  we have started with the “Quarantine Edition” fashion show which will be premiered globally on Sunday 31st May 2020. The project was put together whilst adhering to the UK government's guidelines regarding Covid-19 and social distancing; this was inclusive of risk assessments to ensure the health and safety of the team and contributors was upheld at every turn. The premiere will be available on YouTube Instagram TV - Instagram/YouTube: @CantStopFashion_Official            If the target is surpassed:    If the target funding is surpassed  our aim is to expand our attention to other organisations  charities or settings at risk from unnecessary exposure that would also benefit from assistance to protect themselves (e.g. homeless shelters  soup kitchens  public sector cleaners  public transport staff and other “customer facing” services).

This comes at a steep cost and adding on travel to the Medserena Scanner and to see the UK specialist after the scan we need to raise £2000. The NHS does not own an Upright MRI Scanner and therefore is unable to offer the test required  hence having to pay privately for the scan she has been referred for. Pip wants to enjoy being a mum  but as you can imagine; with this hanging over her head it’s a very emotional time. If you can make a donation or help with a fundraiser  we would appreciate it so much. You can make donations via PayPal. After everything that has been thrown at her over the last 6 years she has fought through to defy all odds. She’s living every second to the max  even starting her little business from home 3 years ago (Pip’s Embroidery UK) when many people would have just given up on employment.

Living in a small Illinois town they were an oddity  and racism did exist. Not a day goes by where my family & I do not worry about each other  but we worry more about the ones who can be murdered for just being black in a white world.     50% of the donations that are raised over the course of the fundraiser will be donated to Stand up Against Racism & Inequality.     You can learn more about the charity by visiting their website: https://www.sariweb.org.uk/who-we-are/about-sari/      This is not a Black Lives Matter only organization  but helps with all racism  bigotry  and sexism.

As some of you may be aware  I am a member of the Helderberg Rotary Club in South Africa  where I have been involved in the local township’s ‘Schools Project’. As a result of the Corona virus we are now focused on providing food and shelter to the thousands of families  particularly young Children in our local townships; Nomzano  Lwandle   Sir Lowrys Village and Macassar.    Below are some of the projects that we have recently initiated and for which we are desperately seeking financial support;    Somerset West Night Shelter – accommodates the homeless in the Somerset West area who at this time are severely affected by the situation. We are providing the Shelter with hot meals  toiletries and warm blankets.    The Ikhaya Soup Kitchen earlier this week. It supplies hot meals to 815 People three times a week.            The MHELP Soup Kitchen in Macassar hands out food parcels to some 250 people three times a week.          Masikule provides food and toiletries to some 1 950 families totalling about 8 400 people in areas around Sir Lowry’s village and Macassar.    Any donation to help these projects would be greatly appreciated. No management costs will be applied by Rotary  as all members are volunteers. This means that every penny (or rand!)  is spent solely on purchasing food and other essentials and the distribution to the families who live in these local townships. Thank you very much  warm regards and please stay healthy.    RONAN & GERRY  30th April 2020      Below are some of the photos taken this week at the Ikhaya after school.               ",False

I am working towards becoming one of the first girls to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout. My Eagle project is a food drive for the Soup Kitchen London.  ​  About the Soup Kitchen:   The Soup Kitchen London  located on Tottenham Court Road  is a resource for the homeless  elderly  lonely and vulnerable in London. They provide free meals  clothing  toiletries and a sense of belonging to over 150 friends each day. Additionally  they provide an on-site therapist to address our guests' mental health needs. With the help of hundreds of volunteers each year  their aim is to provide a nutritious meal in a safe and warm environment that welcomes anyone who needs it.    Soup Kitchen serves two meals a day. The first meal consists of a takeaway bag (a social distancing effort) containing a sandwich  soup  yoghurt  porridge  a piece of fruit and a snack bar. The second meal consists of a nutritional and balanced hot lunch.   ​  Why I am fundraising:   Due to coronavirus  the Soup Kitchen London is one of the last organisations feeding the homeless in Central London. Four other organisations have had to stop their operations. The Soup Kitchen has lost a large amount of funding  donations and volunteers. Despite this  their number of guests have skyrocketed and more than 1/4 of their guests are new faces.    With the funds raised  I will purchase food supplies for the Soup Kitchen. Supplies like tinned vegetables  tinned beans  tinned tomatoes  pasta  butter porridge oats  dried herbs  stock powder  sugar  vegetable oil  salt/pepper  jam  peanut butter  tinned fruit  dried fruit and instant coffee/tea. The purchased food will be thoroughly sanitized and dropped off at the Soup Kitchen in a socially distanced way.    What you can do:   If you are able to donate £5 that would be amazing!

The cost of the trip is £4 570 which needs to be raised by mid-July. I have already raised £460 from selling sweets in the school canteen in the spring term last year but was unable to continue this particular fundraising due to Covid. I am entering 2021 determined to reach my target funds with some great new and inspired fundraising ideas - building on my passions and interests. In Costa Rica I will be part of a team working on projects such as building toilets  health centers and classrooms which will help local communities  we will also be undertaking projects to protect the ecosystem and help the local wildlife. I am excited for this amazing once-in-a-lifetime experience and hope that you will help me to achieve my target.    PLEASE GET INVOLVED IN YOUR CHOICE OF SPONSORSHIP:     - Weekly batch cooking for Hope for Food.... Helping the needy in Bournemouth. Each week I will be spending multiple hours batch cooking for local soup kitchens. Hot  healthy meals for our local homeless to help them through these cold months  during this pandemic  as less people are out on the streets  resulting in fewer donations. Christmas Day 2019 I helped deliver tailored  festive care packages (created by Marisa Whitty) to local homeless people  and saw their dire need first hand. Batch cooking is how I would like to help this year and I would be very appreciative if you would sponsor me. I've always enjoyed cooking and hope this will boost my skills in the kitchen as well as helping others!     - Fitness Challenge.... My dad and I will take on the iconic London to Brighton Cycle Ride  leave the buzz of the city behind and face the challenge of a 55-mile journey on two wheels from the heart of London to the buzzing Brighton seafront! We have never done anything like this before and it is a huge challenge  requiring much fitness prep in the run-up. Throughout the ride  we will make our way through the idyllic English countryside putting our pedals to the test on Ditchling Beacon before gliding down to Brighton to cross the finish line  with relief! My family will be supporting me with water stops along the way and meet us for a well-earned dinner in Brighton!     - Becoming Fluent in Spanish... I am going to become as fluent as possible in Spanish before I go to Costa Rica. Costa Rica is a Spanish speaking country so this will be a very valuable and useful skill not only for the trip but also for the rest of my life! I am going to do this by completing the Spanish Duolingo Course  doing 1-1.5hrs a day of practice (from now until I leave in mid-July!) on top of GCSE Spanish lessons  that I am taking already.

" Help In Time Of Need ","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/christmas-food-bank-appeal,1090,25000,,2020-11-04,,,0,,"Restoring Our Community Christmas Foodbank Appeal    We  at Restoring Our Community (ROC)  were always aware of Food Banks and the great work they do in the community but the first Coronavirus lockdown really brought home to us how much they were needed.    We started off supporting Food Banks with large quantities of food items which were about to go to waste  donated to us by a company. Since then we have formed alliances with organisations and churches and have continued the work of supporting Food Banks.    The need is so great that the queues at Food Banks seem to be ever growing  so we decided to make it our priority to encourage the setup of more Food Banks in local areas.     To this end  we have now embarked on opening a Food Bank in Leyton E10. This will serve as a Food Bank  Soup Kitchen and a Distribution Hub as we continue to work with other organisations and Food Banks to cater for those in need.     As a community  in one of the world's richest countries  food poverty should never happen. COVID-19 has left individuals unemployed  feeling isolated  vulnerable and  as a result  hungry. Many people are embarrassed to say they have nothing to eat and with a 2nd lockdown now in place  we have already started to notice a spike in the number of people accessing Food Bank services once again.     Currently  we receive free perishable items 4 times a week but we would like to raise funds for non perishable items: pasta  rice  tin foods etc. which we can give to people in need for free. We are sure that you might have supported your local Food Bank in the past by donating items directly to them or putting extra items in the food trolleys at your local supermarket - this Gofundme initiative takes the hassle out of you purchasing the items and getting them to a Food Bank as we do the purchasing and if we are able to bulk purchase  then we will attract greater discounts from wholesalers which in turn means we can purchase and distribute more food items.     With Christmas coming up  no person or family should go hungry and we are asking for your support by making a donation to help us ensure that happens.     No amount is too small or too large  but £10 can contribute greatly to feeding an individual for a week.     Please support so that everyone can have a Merry Christmas!
