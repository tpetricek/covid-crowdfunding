,"Baptist Church,Victoria Street  Windsor,Berkshire  SL4 1EH","Windsor Homeless Project","  The Windsor Homeless Project  Enabling homeless and vulnerable people to rebuild their lives.  Our ambition is that every person in our community should have the chance to live a settled, self-supporting and fulfilling life.   We are here to provide a mixture of immediate and long term support to anyone who reaches out for help.  Most of our clients meet us at our drop-in day centre, which is open to anyone. Guests will be greeted with a warm welcome from our wonderful volunteers, a delicious hot meal, and the chance to ask for help.  We will then work with our clients, empowering them to work towards their own goals - whatever they may be - and taking the steps they need to, to rebuild their lives. This might include finding housing, finding employment or voluntary work, working towards better financial health, improving their health, or improving relationships. Whatever it is, we are here to support.  We could not be here without the fantastic support of our local community.

Shelter will help anyone with a housing problem, whether they are a home-owner struggling to pay their mortgage, a tenant in conflict with their landlord or a homeless person looking for a roof over their head. Our housing experts give advice and support by phone or email, or face-to-face at our network of housing aid centres and in county courts and outreach centres.   We also have specialist projects that provide long term support to people who are trying to escape bad housing and homelessness.   Shelter tackles the root causes of bad housing by lobbying government and local authorities for new laws and policies, and more investment, to improve the lives of homeless and badly housed people.  Our influential campaigns bring aspects of bad housing to the attention of the media and the public, who  help us fight for solutions.   Shelter believes that everybody needs a home in a place they can thrive.

Where will the money go?  All the funds you raise will contribute towards helping vulnerable young people who are either homeless or faced with homelessness find a safe place to live, receive support when they need it and have someone to turn to when they feel they have nowhere else to go. Most of all, you’ll be giving them hope and a real opportunity for a positive future.       ",False,2021-06-11,"2021-06-30 20/2021-06-29 50/2021-06-28 200/2021-06-28 30/2021-06-28 20/2021-06-28 10/2021-06-28 15/2021-06-28 10/2021-06-27 10/2021-06-27 20/2021-06-21 20/2021-06-17 5/2021-06-11 10",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=ManishPatelFW&pageUrl=1,2021-07-02,,,460
