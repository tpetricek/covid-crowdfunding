" Thank you High Peak Food Bank and Zink Project ","Buxton, East Midlands, United Kingdom",https://www.gofundme.com/f/thank-you-high-peak-food-bank-and-zink-project,500,175,2021-07-22,2021-06-22,"THE ZINK PROJECT CIO","Registered nonprofitDonations eligible for Gift Aid.",5,"2021-07-22 25/2021-06-30 100/2021-06-28 20/2021-06-24 10/2021-06-22 20","I first came in to contact with Zink in September last year. Having had a mental breakdown and suicide attempt I was struggling mentally and financially. I went to the food bank and while there I had a mini breakdown. This is when I met [Zink Advice Worker] Julie. Julie was extremely easy to talk to and quickly gained my trust to be able to talk to her. She helped me sort through piles of paperwork  speaking to people about bills and debts  getting me to speak to the right people to help me and being there when I just needed to talk. Since September I have been diagnosed with autism and the biggest problem I had was a debt to my landlord of over Â£4000 for which they had an eviction order. Julie was instrumental in helping me get a court hearing where the eviction was suspended. Julie's knowledge was brilliant and made we aware of funds/benefits available to me and because of this in under nine months I have been able to pay off (through myself and funds) the entire arrears and have the eviction set aside. For the first few months I was also reliant on the food bank side while my money git sorted.  I cannot thank Julie (and Zink and high peak food bank) enough for the last nine months. Without her and them I certainly wouldn't be in as good a position as I am now - mentally  financially and emotionally.   I want to give back and as I am not working I don't have the means to give what I want.   This is my thank you. Please help me so that they can continue to help people back on their feet the way they have helped me.   In addition to this I have had some lovely people on here and B and Q donate materials for making a mosaic and Buxton Woodwork  Buxton building supplies and Markovitz have all donated enough materials for me to make around six bird tables and several bird boxes. These will be being sold and auctioned off by Zink/food bank for some more money for them.   Thank you in advance as I say thanks to them",False

As a local carer champion in the borough of Lewisham  London United Kingdom  In partnership with Grillaz BBQ Bistro Cafe LoungeU.K LTD and AFE Global Development Foundation who during the pandemic made and distributed meals to communities in partnership with local Chefs to ensure children and families were fed during lockdown.

Following the success of the goodwill during the height of the pandemic last year  I am hoping to team up with community local champions in various boroughs to fight poverty through this initiative.   We are raising money to secure a central fulfilment centre so that we can centralise our efforts in reaching and providing out services daily.    We want to secure a space to not only cook and provide our meals but also provide a safe space where children can come and eat a warm meal and receive support and advice about life  from education to well being support.   What we need?  With lockdown easing and support for families also easing we want to ensure that families do not face the fear of not being able to feed their children.   To ensure that we can reach as many children and families as possible we need a permanent fulfilment centre where all our operations  services and activities can be centralised. ",False

","Norwich, East of England, United Kingdom",https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-andy-get-a-wheelchair,0,10000,,2021-05-27,,,0,,"4 years ago I was struck down with a very rare illness. Its a form or autoimmune arthritis that has destroyed my body and left me disabled literally overnight. It continues to destroy my joints every day but thanks to medication it has been slowed down a bit. Then  last year  to make matters worse  I caught a form of coronovirus that put me in hospital for 2 months. I spent 3 weeks in a coma on a lung bypass machine. I very nearly died and at more than one occasion my wife was told to prepare for the worst and was told that I had about a 10% chance of survival. I lived but I have been left with severe lung damage. I have lost about 40% of my lung function and now require oxygen constantly.   So now I need a wheelchair to go anywhere that requires walking a distance and oxygen too.   I have been left with other side effects of the coronovirus and the arthritis causes a lot more issues than just my joints but it would take an age to list them all and describe them too so I will just say that I am f*#*Ed.   I have a wife  3 boys and a granddaughter and I'm only 45 so it's like my life has been taken away from me far too soon as I miss out on so much. I can't have a kick around with my son  I struggle with chess. I can't teach my youngest how to ride his bike. My life really sucks. Life on the pittance of benefits we get is terrible. Food banks help and there are many other groups out there that help out too but we never have any money to be able to have any decent standard of life. So please put your hand in your pocket and help me and my family out. Help me out so I can get a decent  working wheelchair. Help us out so that maybe we could have a dream family holiday. Help us out so we can get our house decorated. Jobs that I was going to do but now I can't. Help us out so we can get our garden sorted out. The list goes on and on of things I wanted to do but can't anymore. Please just help us out. ",True

It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has launched to support our community and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.  The Lambeth Food Bank Fund   Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.   In Lambeth we have a history of looking after one another - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.   So we are creating something called the Lambeth Food Bank Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.   Our borough has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has been set up for us to help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.   Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Lambeth. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.     * * *   FAQs  What can I do?  Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the most vulnerable.   Where will the funds go?  The funds will go to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by Holy Trinity Clapham and delivered to food banks across the borough - including Brixton & Norwood  Clapham Park  Vauxhall  and Waterloo - that can help the most vulnerable.   If I do donate will it go to those who need it?   Yes  your donation will go to those who need it. Unlike other platforms  GoFundMe do not charge a fundraising fee although they take a small transaction fee. See here for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to.   I want to help my local community  will this money be spent in Lambeth?   Yes.   Where can I find accurate information about covid-19?   For general information on CV-19  please visit the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response  Lambeth Council have some useful information: https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/elections-and-council/about-lambeth/coronavirus-covid-19-information  If you are worried about your own health  call the NHS on 111.

Itâs crazy how the pandemic we currently living in has caused all kinds of financial difficulties situations and families have had no choice but to turn to the food banks for help and assistance. I know that raising money will help the food bank buy essential food. It saddens me to see how the numbers have doubled as more people are being impacted by COVID-19 with job losses and furlough leaving families struggling to find money to buy enough food. We have all seen the headlines regarding school meals but it's easy to forget for a lot of these children that is the only balanced meal they will get. In the first six months of the pandemic  some food banks in the United Kingdom gave out a staggering 1.2 million emergency food parcels. Thatâs one food parcel every 13 seconds  and 2 600 of these went to children every day on average. I decided to walk 2021 km and hopefully get this achieved within 10 months. So if you see me walking please give me a cheer and some motivational comments. Every penny helps put food on the table and allowing families to try not stress financially or have to choose between food and heating. So please consider donating to a worthy cause.    So I'm looking for your support. Together we can make a difference.  ",False

The fall off in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that we have had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased our costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one week costs Â£14  or Â£18 with toiletries. All donations will go directly to purchasing items for food parcels.

GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw Since We Care was launched as the UK's largest independent food bank and advice and support hub in Lewisham in 2014  we have always ensured that  during school holidays and Christmas  children and the hungry families they come from do not have to worry about putting food on the table. This half term  however  and over this coming Christmas  we truly need your help to feed the new wave of people and pets from across London who are in crisis and will be coming through our doors this winter at Kath's Place  50 Friendly Street  Deptford SE8 4DR.    Can you imagine losing up to 40% of your monthly income? That is the reality for so many people in the present crisis. Rents are so high in our area that people in work do not have enough cash to pay the rent and  probably for the first time in their lives  are having to trade a visit to their local coffee shop for a visit to the We Care Food Bank and Food Pantry for help  advice  support and solidarity. Embarrased and even ashamed  but even more desperate and distraught that their kids are going hungry  mums tell us that they can go days without food  and  on average  it takes people at least a week of going hungry before they finally come through our doors and ask for help. We really do need your donation this Christmas GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw . Becasue we help everyone and anyone and do not focus on one particular group (such as refugees or the homeless) we get absolutely NO national or local government funding or any other type of funding.

Barrow Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. There has never been a more crucial time to help those who are less fortunate than us - which is why I have organised this event.     The Covid-19 effect   Well before Covid-19 hit the UK  food banks in the Trussell Trust network had been seeing year-on-year increases in levels of need  with 1.9 million emergency food parcels given out in 2019/20. As Covid-19 hit the UK  the Trussell Trust saw an immediate and sustained surge in need across its food banks. In April there was an 89% increase in the number of emergency food parcels given out compared with the same month in 2019. This included a 107% increase in the number of parcels given to children  compared to the same period last year. New findings show that almost 100 000 households received support from a food bank in the Trussell Trust network for the very first time between April and June 2020. It's no secret that the pandemic has had a significant impact on people's jobs and finances - increasing the use of foodbanks nationwide.     What are we doing?   Since March 2020  many people (including myself) have adopted a new hobby in running. Whether it is to pass time  get out of the house  keep fit whilst the gyms are closed or a tool to manage your mental health. Everyone has their individual reasons for running and it would be fantastic to use this as an opportunity to help and support our local foodbank through completing a half marathon challenge (13.1 miles or 21.09 kilometres).     When?  Those who are taking part will complete the run on either Friday 23rd April  Saturday 24th April or Sunday 25th April - uploading their run to the page when complete.     Donations  There is a group target amount of Â£1 000 and every penny donated is hugely appreciated. However  I am conscious of the financial difficulties that many people face due to the current situation  therefore  it is absolutely fine if you are unable to donate - you can always share this page instead!

Due to the pandemic  countless numbers of small and local businesses have been forced to close - with barbershops/hair salons being examples of the businesses that are suffering the most. Now  the normal response for the owner of a business like this would be to take advantage of rate relief  seek bridge funding for the business and also look for financial support being offered to people that are self-employed.    But not Ziggy...        Ziggy has converted the Barbershop into a Food Bank that is specifically focused on helping the elderly and other vulnerable members of the local community to have access to the food and sustenance they need in a time when it may be challenging to make trips to supermarkets or go shopping themselves.    We all know that local businesses like barbershops are massive pillars within communities as they are connected to so many people and aware of a range of local issues. So  who better and where better for a Food Bank to support vulnerable people to come from?        As it stands  Ziggy is not only travelling (on his own dime) to his shop  to the homes of people who cannot make it to his Food Bank and even spending his own money to buy food if he is short on donations from local people that are aware his Food Bank Exists. ALL WHILST HE IS LOSING MONEY AS HE CANNOT TRADE AND RUN HIS BUSINESS AS NORMAL.    So  now we need to support this local hero by helping to alleviate the financial pressure that comes from still having to maintain the utility costs at the shop  the transport costs that come with running the Food Bank and also to help access further food to support vulnerable local people.",False

We are fortunate to have secured a premises rent free  but the need for food is increasing so funds are needed now more than ever. The Â£10000 we are hoping to raise will keep our shelves well stocked for the next six months and allow us to invest in a range of training for our volunteers  introduce more grants and support schemes for our service users and maybe even secure a van to enable our service to travel. We are fairly unique amongst food banks in that we do not limit the number of food parcels someone can access in a year  we accept self referrals and also offer fresh food that includes fruit and vegetables  cheese  milk and a range of frozen foods in addition to the usual ambient packets. We also try and offer our service users a degree of choice to ensure a sense of dignity and we provide advice  guidance and onward referrals where needed.

Now  we need your support more than ever.    Due to massive demand and the end of the lease on our current Warehouse we are moving to a brand new home that will help us increase our capacity and speed up our operations  helping us to continue to put food donated by the community straight into the hands of those who need it.     This is an exciting chapter in Canterbury Food Bankâs history  and a brilliant opportunity for us to grow and change in response to new challenges. But it is also an expensive chapter; our previous premises were occupied on a peppercorn lease of Â£10 a month  so by paying the market rate for a suitable property our rental costs have been multiplied 133 times.     We are asking our community to help us raise a year of rent - Â£16 000 - up front so that all other funds can be used to buy and deliver food. Please donate and share this appeal widely to secure the future of the Food Bank as a key charity in the district.     PRESS RELEASE -    Canterbury Food Bank today launched a campaign to help pay for its new building - after its rent multiplied 133 times.     The charity is moving to another warehouse  specially converted to suit its needs  because the lease on its current premises has come to an end.    CFB had been paying a peppercorn rent of Â£10 a month for the old building  but will now have to pay market rate of Â£16 000 a year.     Its Raise the Rent campaign aims to cover the rental costs so that all other funds can be used to buy and deliver food. The new  bigger warehouse  near Whitstable  secures the future of CFB as a key charity in the district.     Demand in the past 12 months has at times more than trebled year-on-year and in December it provided enough food to make more than 10 000 meals.     The economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 crisis  and the uncertainty of Brexit  are the main reasons behind the spike.    The charity has signed a five-year lease on the 3 780 square foot  two storey warehouse  which will be used to store donations of food and as an office.     CFB chair Martin Ward said: âWeâre pleased and relieved to have secured our long-term future at a time when our services have never seen such high demand.     âIt has become clear over the past year that  even more than ever  a backstop is needed to help those who can not afford food.     âWe are that backstop and it is our intention to remain so for as long as we are required.     âThese are difficult times for many people and we ask the public to help us support those most in need.â    CFB provides emergency three-day food parcels to individuals and families in financial need across Canterbury  Whitstable  Herne Bay and surrounding villages.    It has donation baskets in all leading supermarkets including Sainsburyâs  Tesco  Asda and Morrisons  where people can leave dried or tinned food items. ",False

We are raising money for the church food bank.    CAC Surrey Docks has been approached by many people from the community for food. This action has created an awareness to the Welfare hub of the church in recognising the challenges facing the under privileged/vulnerable people in our community.    We aim to provide weekly free breakfast for people within our locality which are identified below:   âªï¸ Rough sleepers  âªï¸Frail and elderly people   âªï¸The Homeless  âªï¸ Families with children that have no recourse to public funds.    âªï¸Widow/widowers within the community.  âªï¸Single parents and People living alone with no help.    Basic essentials of life (feeding  clothing and proper shelter) are becoming more difficult to access.  However  the church community welfare project has been working behind the scenes to help make life more tolerable for these people.    âªï¸The project is currently struggling due to lack of suffucient funds  hence our appeal to your compassionate heart to reach out to our dear neighbours in this challenging situation.    Part of the criteria to birth this project is the construction of a storage to hold all of our donated items (cloths  food and other household items) . We are currently aiming to raise funds of about Â£5 000.00 to construct this storage.    It will be purposefully used towards our goal to cater for the needs of these vulnerable people.    Your monetary donations will be highly appreciated and received with gladness in our heart. Our prayer is that you will be blessed beyond your expectations.

Our family were in awe by his altruistic desire to give  feed and aid ALL  despite race/ethnicity/religion among him even whilst suffering himself.     Since opening  our family alone have vetted 25 families with monthly food rations from December 2019- present. Unfortunately  25 families do not cover the innumerable amount of people starving  for whom we want to share some light  hope and nurture to amidst dark times  that is their indefinite reality.    Our foodbank prioritises poor families with children  single mothers/widowers and those who themselves or their children suffer with debilitating mental/physical health issues trying to make ends meet to provide for their children- this is done with rigorous checks by our team to ensure nobody exploits such a service. The families are issued with a monthly ration card valid for 12 months which provides them with stock for each month as per the individual needs of the family. These include: 10kg chapati flour (atta)  5kg sugar  5kg various lentils/daal  5kg rice  5L cooking oil  tea leaves  salt  spices and other necessary food items. Â£25 will feed a family of 5 for the month however any donation  no matter how big or small will impact them greatly.     100% of the donationsgo to those in need  with our incredible staff being voluntary workers (so no wages or salaries are deducted from donations) and our facilities funded with the finances that the late Safdar Hussain Shah left behind for us to carry this out in his legacy- we are relying on your kind donations which will solely provide stock for the families.     During the current COVID-19 crisis  we are aiming to try and provide emergency food supplies to all those suffering in the locale  with the most vulnerable holding priority  we are giving out thousands of food rations but are broken to see that we are unable to extend our help to everyone that needs it- as a small start-up charity  we are grateful for all the support and donations we receive in order to help us reach as many individuals suffering from the crisis as possible.     Unfortunately  we can't do this alone  with the power of unity together we can help fill the stomachs of the poor  not only with food but also the fulfilment of life and hope they may gradually receive from your donations. Our brothers and sisters around the globe need us  we are united by our efforts.   Any donation  no matter how big or small will be greatly appreciated especially in the blessed month of Ramadan  whereby charity is considered its greatest.     We are not the givers  we are just Allah SWT  the Almighty's  servants and can only give what he allows and wishes to be given.

This support started when there was no halal food support in the local area of Sharrow and Netheredge and people were struggling to buy basic food for themselves. Due to a gap in the area and a desperate need TSY collaborated with few others to collectively reach out to the most vulnerable including single parents  elderly  self isolating and hardship such as loss of income. All our work is voluntary and since March kind donations from local community has assisted us in making sure no one struggled alone. We are running low on cash donations to purchase food to continue this vital support and are reaching out to anyone who can support us by using this link and donating whatever little they can towards the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank project. Due to the level of need and referrals coming in since the start of this halal foodbank  we have called it Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank to avoid any barriers to any non-muslim vulnerable that maybe in need of this support. We would be very grateful for your support towards this cause and request you to please share widely amongst your contacts. For further information on TSY and the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank please feel free to contact:- Nighat Basharat (Founding Director) on 07988033534/[email redacted]",False

We at our local Worthing Seventh Day Adventist Church are doing our part to support those experiencing a difficult time in our community  through helping them with utility bills  shopping  financial support due to loss of income  etc.           Our Good Samaritan funds which we use for those in need are running low  which is why we are crowd funding to raise funds to help those affected in any way by COVID-19 in our local community.           Any little helps. Weâll be so grateful for any contribution you can make  not matter how small.     May God bless you for it and multiply your donation in blessings to you.",False

100/2020-04-12 10/2020-04-12 20","THANKS FOR VISITING MY FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN TO SAVE THE SUN NEWSPAPER AFTER THEY REPORTED A Â£201M LOSS AND THE COMPANY'S VALUE WAS ADJUSTED TO ZERO!    Throughout this Coronavirus crisis  Britain's most-loved newspaper has been under threat. Declining sales and advertising revenue could consign this shining example of journalistic standards to a terrible fate  and it's time that we stood up and took a stand.    The Sun was already suffering a financial crisis before Covid-19 even took hold ...      However  things have now become desperate for this historically blemish-free institution of British publishing with their very own Dan Wootton encouraging everyone to buy a copy and keep them in business - it does cost less than a cup of coffee after all.      Instead of just merely buying a copy to keep them in business  I want to take things further.    I will take every penny that is donated to this fundraising campaign and every day I will use it to buy copies of The Sun from my local store  and then deliver them absolutely free of charge to homes in my local area in South Essex. If other people follow my lead and set up their own fundraising campaigns  we could send their circulation through the roof in a matter of days!    IMPORTANT NOTE: During the lockdown  it's taking ages to get my kids to bed every night  and usually by the time they have settled down my local Sainsbury's is closed. If this happens on any particular day  I will donate the money to local food banks instead.    ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: I don't like rain  so if it is raining on any particular day I will donate any money collected to local food banks instead.    YET ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: I don't like sun or wind either  so if it is sunny or windy on any particular day I will donate any money collected to local food banks instead. I'm not fond of clouds either.    ONE FURTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: We should all be staying at home as much as possible at the moment to protect the NHS and save lives  and so if I think that there may be any people out and about in the United Kingdom at the same time as me on any particular day I will remain at home and donate any money collected to local food banks instead.    ONE MORE VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: If you actually think that I am giving that sh*t rag a single penny of this instead of donating the money to local food banks  you're very much mistaken.

The blasts in Beirut  were pretty devastating  but the important news in all this was that more than 6 000 people were injured  plus 150 killed  dozens still missing to this hour as rescue teams search for them  & hundreds of homes & peopleâs livelihoods were shattered  rendering nearly 3000 homeless.     As a result  Beirut has been declared a disaster striken city.     With the port -- Lebanon's economical lifeline -- totally destroyed   food shortages will spike & many families will go without.Already  Lebanon was suffering from massive food & fuel shortages  and now it will not be able to import anything. Bleak  darker days for hundreds of thousands of people lie ahead!     This is urgent.     Lebanon needs you now.    Please donate so we can ensure people have a place to stay safe  food to eat & the means to survive & overcome this catastrophe.    Pray for lebanon ...    Your help is more needed than ever     Your donations will help contribute to:    -hospital bills  -small repairs  -Buy basic food items to put together food parcels for many who will have nothing to eat today and in many more days to come.   -Life saving medications for those in need & unable to afford those.We need to help those on the ground with whatever means we can.    Help us help people   we beg you!         ___________________________________      Half the population are living in abject poverty.     People are dying  not from Covid  but from starvation  lack of medication and healthcare.    The economy  currency and banking system have failed. Inflation has been the final blow. Many in work have not been paid for months and others have lost their job and cannot feed their families or pay the rent.     Callers from across Lebanon have been begging for help on the programme âSahtak Bill Dinyeh â (your health is worth the world) on Sawt al Ghad radio .    Helped by many charitable people  the programmeâs host Dory Nasr has distributed food  medicine and basic necessities.        Now the warehouse is empty.      Lebanese around the world and those sympathetic to the countryâs plight can help by donating what they can. Every penny helps  paying for baby milk  food  medicine and housing.    Hala and Dana  two British-Lebanese expats  decided to kickstart this fundraiser to help secure both continuity and replenishment of the food bank. This is a much needed lifeline  without which many families will be doomed with both hunger and displacement.       Le Liban est au bord de lâeffondrement total.    La moitiÃ© de la population vit dans une pauvretÃ© extrÃªme.    Les gens meurent  non pas de Covid  mais de faim  de manque de mÃ©dicaments et de soins de santÃ©.    L'Ã©conomie  la monnaie et le systÃ¨me bancaire ont Ã©chouÃ©. L'inflation a Ã©tÃ© le coup de grÃ¢ce. Beaucoup dâemployÃ©s n'ont pas reÃ§u leurs salaires depuis des mois et d'autres ont perdu leur emploi et ne peuvent plus nourrir leurs familles  payer le loyer ou acheter des medicaments vitaux.    Les appelants de part et dâautre du Liban ont implorÃ© l'aide sur l'Ã©mission Â«Sahtak Bill DinyehÂ» (votre santÃ© vaut le monde) sur la radio Sawt al Ghad .    Avec lâaide de nombreuses personnes charitables  lâanimateur du programme  Dori Nasr  a distribuÃ© de la nourriture  des mÃ©dicaments et des produits de premiÃ¨re nÃ©cessitÃ©.

Update: 3rd March  2021    Another interview with The Independent  describing the struggle to survive on Universal Credit and my fears about the cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/budget/budget-universal-credit-20-pounds-b1811750.htmlTaking this opportunity to thank everyone for their ongoing support - you are wonderful and I couldn't do this without you.   .  .  .      Update: 19th January  2021 I've been interviewed by The Independent about the catastrophic consequences of the upcoming Universal Credit cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/b1789040.html      .  .  .        My original message: 30th August  2019    This is incredibly difficult for me to write  but I need to ask my friends  acquaintances and perhaps even some people whom I donât know  to help me get through the next few months.    I am a domestic abusive survivor struggling to meet essential living costs and the situation is going to escalate rapidly because my employer is deducting more than 25% of my pay from September onwards  to recover two overpayments they made in error for a really long time  without me or payroll noticing.    Iâm already on a low income and have been trying to find a more stable job. Until now Iâve been working two jobs  but the temporary one is coming to an end and I will only have my permanent part-time job â where they have persistently tried to dismiss me on health grounds so aside from the overpayment recovery  I just canât hold on there for much longer.    Whenever I do give my notice or get dismissed  theyâll take the entirety of my final monthâs pay.    I live alone but the person I used to cohabit with left substantial utility bill debts at our home that I didnât become aware of until later  since they lied about having cleared balances. Thereâs not enough space to move another person in  and I canât move out right now for financial and contractual reasons.    Because of an active police investigation for rape and domestic abuse that I canât go into  Iâve already borrowed money for unexpected costs like home security  numerous phone calls to charities and agencies offering professional advice  and private therapy which unfortunately I had to quit.    My chronically poor health has dramatically worsened â Iâve been to a&e twice in the past fortnight because of a kidney infection that didnât respond to treatment and I had to pawn things to pay for my ongoing prescriptions  but thereâs not much of value left for me to sell.    I need to wear glasses but have been doing without for several months since they broke; Iâm doing without a lot of things. One of my cats needs dental surgery soon but this isnât going to be possible.    I earn slightly too much to claim benefits or get free prescriptions and despite years of hospital referrals  I am still fighting for a diagnosis to explain my physical health problems so Iâm not currently eligible for any support that could be claimed.    Unfortunately Iâm estranged from my parents and I donât have regular contact with any other family.    I donât have savings and I wouldnât realistically be able to repay any further money borrowed.    Up to this point Iâve managed to keep on top of the rent and buy cat food but I have now begun going without my own food  even before overpayment recovery has started. Iâm hoping to access a food bank next week but the period I can use them for will be limited.    Itâs hard to put a figure on how much help I should ask for  since the only real solution is me finding a job where theyâre not actively trying to dismiss me for my chronic health problems  but I am hopeful that if I can just get straight with the money I already owe and raise a couple of monthsâ living expenses to buy myself time whilst finding a better job  then I can make things work.

Since we were founded 10 months ago  we have continued to support local schools and their families with vital food packages. This is something that is really important to us as we have come to realise how many people are struggling in the county and have been shocked by it. We have built a fantastic relationship with local schools and knowing we are doing something for these young people and their families is very rewarding. As well as schools we have provided food packages to the Northamptonshire community mental health team  'leaving care': an organisation for individuals who are leaving the care system  HM probation services  local community groups as well as many families or vulnerable individuals who have reached out for support.     The McCarthy-Dixon foundation started initially as an emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a food bank and food delivery service. We have quickly broadened our services after realising the scope of both poverty and hardship in the local area. The community has always been at the heart of what we do and this means we will change and adapt to what the community needs.",False

Free Meals  Full Hearts is designed to bridge that gap and ensure that if your situations changes quickly  or you just need a little help - we're here for you. Anonymously.    I have heard some truly eye opening stories since creating this charitable group - everything from families only eating one meal a day and a couple who hadn't had a hot meal in days to another family who had literally only eaten canned beans and hoops for 10 days solidly because their weekly food budget was Â£9 to feed 5. It really does put life in perspective.    No-one in our community should go hungry. Ever.    The Reading community has shown time and time again that when faced with challenges or adversities  we come together. The camaraderie  generosity and positivity around us every day is overwhelming.    Feeding yourself and your family is a basic but essential human necessity but unfortunately far too many people in the Reading area are skipping meals and going hungry because they simply can't afford to eat. I can only imagine this must be particularly heartbreaking if you're a parent who is unable to feed your children. As momentum has increased and more and more people have heard about Free Meals  Full Hearts and we occasionally find ourselves struggling to help due to lack of physical food donations. When this happens  I either dip into the reserve pot or sometimes  out of my own pocket i'll buy emergency food shops for families (between Â£30-Â£50 per week depending on the size of the family).

Every week we take the money you have kindly donated to a cash and carry and buy  in bulk  what the four food banks we are working with have told us they desperately need. (See pics below). This is complemented by a weekly visit to the Felix Project where we load up with fresh fruit  veg  meat  eggs and cheese. All of this is delivered to community kitchens who cook up meals for those most in need in W10.    We are currently working with The Dalgarno Trust   Bay 20   The Space and The Tabernacle . All four of these charities provide meals  bags of shopping and many other support services to those experiencing food poverty in W10. Kensington and Chelsea boasts some of the highest net worth inhabitants but also has many pockets of severe deprivation â North Kensington is one of the deepest. A sobering fact to note is that 31.6% of children in this borough live in poverty.    Food banks we are working alongside unanimously concur that the demand for aid has tripled this year since the pandemic began. Help is needed more than ever. Every time we make a drop  the relief and joy the charities express is palpable and sums up how desperate the situation is.    All the money donated will be used to supply fruit  veg and essentials to those in need in North Kensington. Your financial donations will go entirely towards funding this food relief project. All staff  including Rima  Amanda  Maryam and the admin  safeguarding and marketing support team are volunteers.     Please share this page with anyone who might be interested in helping and please donate if you would like to help. A regular donation would make a huge difference  as food poverty is not going to go away.    Thank you for your invaluable support.    Rima  Maryam  Amanda and team.

Over the course of 11 weeks  they raised Â£16 000. With the help of a team of local volunteers producing over 6000 meals  all of which were delivered to those most in need in the North Ken community.     The last campaign attracted a lot of attention with publicity in newspapers both local and national  RBK&C Mayor Gerard Hargreaves came to visit and recently in October this year Rima was on Radio 5 Live discussing food poverty and school meals.

We are continuing to support these families in term time and the holidays.     Â£50 raised will be able to feed 25 young people    Â£100 raised will be able to feed 50 young people    Â£1000 raised will be able to feed 500 young people     There is power in our community. Join us.        Food provision through schools and youth clubs play an essential role in providing food for children and families who are in need of it - this is especially true during the holidays  when Free School Meals (FSM) are not usually available. Recently  the government (after several U-turns) decided to extend funding for FSM over the school holidays  but several families received substandard food packages that still forced them to rely on extra aid from food banks and mutual aid community groups.    Many young people are also not entitled to free school meals during term time because their parents earn above the amount allowed for eligibility for free school meals. In England  earnings from employment must be less than Â£16 190 for families in receipt of Child Tax or Working Tax Credits  and only Â£7 400 per year for families in receipt of Universal Credit.     This is staggeringly low and  when combined with measures such as the two child limit on Universal Credit payments  means that many families struggling to put food on the table are nevertheless deemed ineligible for free school meals. Other families are unable to claim FSM for their children because they have no recourse to public funds (NPRF) which is a condition the government imposes on some families due to their immigration status.      What does this mean?    Those recently impacted by the financial costs of COVID-19 (which are only increasing)  are more likely to go hungry. This will have bothphysiological and psychological impacts on young people and their families.     Why?    The data collected by CPAG on child poverty in the UK are enraging: 4.2 million children were living in poverty in the UK in 2018-19  out of which 700 000 were in London. This has been worsened by the fact that parents and carers are twice as likely to lose their jobs due to the pandemic.     In Lewisham  according to Trust for London   37% of children are in a situation of food insecurity  and 14% of the population needs social benefits to survive. It's deeply distressing that this level of inequality exists in the UK  particularly given that we are one of the richest countries in the world.     Donât know what living with food insecurity feels like? See here .    The figures above reflect the shocking inequality in Britain  which was already severely impacting children and young people before the worst financial effects caused by the pandemic began to be felt. Due to the governmentâs lackluster response to the pandemic  it is projected that the number of children in poverty will increase to 5.2 million by 2022.     We also cannot ignore that this impact has not been distributed equally: people coming from Communities of Colour and immigrant background are over twice as likely to live in hardship than their white British counterparts and  due to the wider structural racial injustices  these communities are also disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. We are certainly not 'all in this together'.      What are we doing about it?     Legendary Community Club  which was named by Chevrington Odoh from the Pro Plus FC   is a grassroots project set up by some members of Lewisham Mutual Aid in partnership with local organisations. Our aim is to deliver emergency food provision to ensure that young people do not go without out  for as long as there is a need.       We will make this happen in three ways:    1. Temporary food provisions have been set-up for families who require this support  in partnership with local schools and community groups.    2. A kitchen has been set up to prepare nutritionally balanced meals for young people through their youth clubs which run after school and in the school holidays.    We know that food charity is not a long term solution. This is not the world we want to live in and we refuse to normalise food banks as a solution to food poverty. This is NOT an inevitable situation.    3. With this in mind  we will continue to work alongside The Children's Society  who have been calling on the government to ensure that every local council adequately funds emergency support for families   so that nobody is left behind in a time of crisis. For more information about their campaign 'Strengthening the Safety Net' see here   and sign the petition here.    We will also continue to support the calls from Save the Children and Child Poverty Action Group who have been lobbying for reforms to the benefits system  as well as an increase in the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit by Â£20  and an end to the two child limit and the Â£20 000 a year benefit cap which hits families in high-rent areas such as Lewisham particularly hard. Lastly  we will continue to support IFAN with the #CashFirst campaign  which has already inspired us to start our very own community-led participatory research project (stay tuned for more on this!).     The way our tax and welfare system is designed is a political choice. There are solutions . We will call on the government and its representatives to be bold  brave and radical in how they approach this problem.       What will we use the funds for?      We will use the money raised from the community to buy food and equipment for the project.    We have a host of volunteers  and multiple clubs and schools signed up and ready to go. The project began on July 21st 2020.       Â£50 raised will be able to feed 45 children     Â£100 raised will be able to feed 90 children     Â£1000 raised will be able to feed 909 children       There is power in our community.

Covid has affected us all but it has hit parts of our community harder than others.     We carried on the amazing work that St Barnabas Primary School began with a 'Community Food Share'  providing food and essential items to local families in this time of need.     We currently support families within the BS2 and surrounding areas  100% of your donations helps us maintain our resources to provide a varied weekly package.     Job security is becoming less stable as the furlough scheme tapers out  gig economy workers can find less work and self employed people are also facing uncertainty  there is still a further need to do more and support people at this time.     We stand together and bridge the gap with this amazing and unified part of Bristol.        Thank you.    To find out more information or get in touch please have a look at our website: https://www.bristolcommunityfoodshare.com/      Donations of NON PERISHABLE food items and bathroom/kitchen essentials can be dropped off at St Werburghs community centre from 10-12 Wednesdays and 11.30-1pm Thursdays.

The masks are distributed âfree of chargeâ to residents  community agencies  key services  care homes  food banks  the medical profession and those most in need across the city Volunteers sew the face masks and help us source material  though donations by residents  which are recycled into masks. Recycling material allows us to help the environment and deliver mask free of charge. Since launching on 8th April 2020 we have made and distributed over 1 000 masks but the demand is increasing especially as more people are going out as we come out of lockout. Volunteers have covered any additional costs to run the project to the stage but now need to raise funds to continue and deliver the increasing demand for masks. ALL the money will be used to: - purchase essential items which are not available through donations. - make and distribute the masks  free of charge to those that request them across the city (Glasgow). - help set up sewing hubs in other cities to provide the same service to residents in that area. Have a look at our Facebook page (Angelic Threads 2020) to see what we have done and how much this project is needed.",False

Ma Shaâ Allah  the Masjid is now trying to cope with the demand and has to overcome many challenges to support the Muslim and also non-Muslim community. Here are just a few of examples of the issues:     We have one main hall which accommodates only 200 people for an average Jumuâah congregation of over 400.      People often have to wait outside in the forecourt for the second Jamaat     Current facilities for ladies accommodates around 30  whereas the demand is known to be in excess of 150. This is severely restricting our ability to meet current demand for women     Our lectures  Fitness Classes  Mother and Toddlers group  daily iftaris in Ramadhan and seniors meet up sessions all take place on the same carpeted area on which we pray. This is not ideal and as we are effectively operating out of one hall  it means that we can only have one activity happening at any given time     The Food Bank only has enough space for a shelf rack to store food. It caters for anyone in need in the Purley community  Muslim and non-Muslim alike        By the Grace of Allah swt we have embarked on the Building Purley Masjid project that will cater for the needs of the community. The project will result in a new Masjid on the current Purley Masjid site and will be a modern  purpose built building for the community spanning 6 floors that will include:     Two male prayer halls with a combined capacity of 500     A ladies prayer hall with capacity of over 200 and crÃ¨che facilities      A multi purpose hall     A dedicated lecture/events hall (we held over 100 last year)  which can accommodate 100 people     Improved facilities for our already existing Youth Activities  Mother and Toddlers Group and Seniors Group     Separate classrooms for our Madrasah classes      More space for our weekly Food Bank  ââ    We already have all these activities running at Purley Masjid but are struggling to meet demands and keep up the excellent level of service we provide.",False

We are so excited about the prospect of bringing this old Grade II listed building back to life! It was originally built in the early 1900âs as a Temperance Hall  since then it has had a plethora of uses  most recent of which left the building in a semi-derelict condition which included severe fire damage.    However  following its acquisition by The Tab Church  fresh ideas began to surface as to how it might be rescued  restored  and adapted to suit the needs for modern usage as Church  Community and Conferencing facility.    The âTab1Milliâ is what will enable this most significant part of the Big Build project vision to become a reality  and the building actually able to be used.    But we canât pull this off without your generous support because this is the largest financial project The Tab has ever undertaken.    We are therefore asking you to join with us through radical generosity  as together we step out in faith towards hitting the Â£1Million target by continually bringing our financial gifts together now and over the coming weeks and months.    Once the entire building is renovated  it will enable The Tab to continue and expand its traditional church functions and community initiatives  which are not limited to but currently include:  Â· Sunday services  Â· Kids church for children  Â· CrÃ¨che during the Sunday services  Â· Weekly prayer meetings  Â· Christian education and classes  Â· Administrative offices  Â· Bookshop/resources  Â· Food Bank â hosting Lewisham Centralâs foodbank and distribution point. This is currently offered two-three times a week  staffed by 8-12 volunteers.  Â· Youth mentoring â support for vulnerable young people in the local community.  Â· Community action team (Restoration Empowerment and Community Help) â which focuses its support and resources on three vulnerable groups in Lewisham:  The elderly (offering days out and grocery food supplies);  The homeless (offering food clothing to those living on the streets)  and  Women and children escaping from domestic abuse (offering support).    *The Big Build Project includes the overall vision of Tabernacle Global Ministries and therefore maybe used for general purposes....",False

On 28.3.20  I picked up my oft idle bagpipes and started wandering rather cluelessly round Broxburn and Uphall playing them. I had realised that as a semi-retired person I was pretty much 'alright Jack' under lockdown and wondered if I could do anything to help others. My first idea  on 20 May  had been to go to NHS Strathbrock and play for the amusement of staff and patients. That day I also put my busking hat down with a sign saying ""all proceeds to...."" After securing permission from the police  I decided to put the hat back on my head and start my ""pipe-walks"" around Kirkhill and West End  intending to return to the Strathbrock  of course  and at least three facilities for older residents near me.

Iâve calculated that for less than a Â£1  I can supply 7 sanitary pads  2 panty liners  7 tampons (applicator + non-applicator) and a chocolate bar for people in need of them.     Menstrual products arenât a luxury; they are essential to well-being  hygiene and happiness  which many of us take for granted. Go With The Flow believes that periods are everyone's problem (humankind wouldnât exist without them!) and so I also call upon the boys to donate too.     Go on  itâs bloody important!",False
