Firstly, let me say thank you for the outpouring of support we've received. It's always a heart-warming feeling to know that we have so many incredible supporters. 

Last week, in light of the Coronavirus, we made the difficult decision to offer a takeaway-only food service to guests rather than their usual sit-down meal. As most of you know, we take a huge amount of pride in the fact that we offer not just a warm meal to our guests, but also a safe and warm space off the streets for them for the hours they're with us. As we considered the health risks we decided that it would be prudent to only offer a takeaway food service for the foreseeable future.

Absolutely any donation will have a huge impact on our services. Thank you for helping us support the homeless, vulnerable, elderly and less fortunate in London!

This is just a small part of my project and I'm partially hoping that it will work as a form of non-traditional&nbsp;public art. Whilst brainstorming ideas for this project, I focused on Peterborough because I have lived here most of my life meaning I have a personal attachment to this specific Urban Environment. A big issue in most urban environments is homelessness because of the overpopulation of the area, meaning it is difficult to earn money and afford a roof over your head, let alone food to eat. This is a huge problem in Peterborough so I'm using this project to start a campaign and raise awareness. </p><p>I have started this fundraising page mainly to raise awareness about Peterborough Soup Kitchen. Upon researching them recently, I have found out that they provide food and drinks for 35 - 76 people A DAY. The charity deserves the donations and if you live in or have visited Peterborough, you will know just how many unfortunate, homeless people there are on the streets.

Meanwhile, the country’s hospital workers are more stretched than ever before.</p><p>WCK is also now activating restaurants to help meet this demand by providing jobs for their staff and meals for those in need.&nbsp;#ChefsForAmerica is making a key connection between people who need meals and restaurant workers and drivers who need to earn a living.</p><p>In these times, many have lost their livelihoods. For some, it has been like climbing a mountain each day. 'Everesting', as its known, involves cycling the height of Mt. Everest (29.029ft / 8848m) by repeating the ascent of one hill on a single ride until the height is reached. I hope that people can support this fantastic cause and help me to raise as much as possible for this tremendous charity that is providing support for those that need it most today.&nbsp;</p><p><span>It will be both physically and mentally challenging, so I&nbsp;</span><span>would be sure to appreciate the occasional ‘ride on’, or chance to ride in a&nbsp;</span><span>group if you are willing to join me for part of it. Just search for me in&nbsp;</span><span>Zwift on 27 Jun anytime from 0700 EST (1200 BST) to 1900 EST (0000 BST) and&nbsp;</span><span>you’ll find me on the Alpe Du Zwift in the world of Watopia.

I wanted to bring awareness to these celebrations as they often get missed from the calendar.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>""Founded in 1998 and held around World Refugee Day on<br>the 20 June, Refugee Week is an open platform, with<br>hundreds of organisations and individuals holding<br>Refugee Week events across the UK every year.<br>This year (15-21 June) will be the first virtual Refugee<br>Week [...]&nbsp;responding to the theme ‘Imagine’."" <b>Refugee Week&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>I took my 'Imagine' theme inspiration from a boy called Ahmad and his brother Jawad who managed to escape the oppression of Afghanistan and stayed in a camp in Calais. Speaking with Jawad he explained to me that he wanted his brother to be with their sister in England so he could have a good life. They boarded a lorry and headed across the channel, making the 21 mile trip to what they hoped would be a better life, nearly dying in the process. The brothers are now thriving in England and Jawad<span>&nbsp;has helped create a VR experience to show people what it is like to travel as a refugee using&nbsp;his younger brother's illustrations. The project is called Parwaz VR and you can find more info here -&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ParwazVR/"">https://www.facebook.com/ParwazVR/</a>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b><u>What am I doing exactly</u></b></p><p><u>On the 18th June I'll be walking the 21 miles from Calais to Dover in one stint which from Penistone where I live, will take me to Dronfield -&nbsp;</u><u>I'll be walking whatever the weather. Refugees don't have the luxury to choose which weather they travel in so neither should I. I do have the privilege to be able to fundraise instead of having to experience displacement - so I am and you have the privilege to donate (so please do if you can)&nbsp;</u></p><p><span>So why RCK? I have been to volunteer with these guys before and the work they do is incredible. They are volunteer-led meaning that the chefs, drivers, pot washers, choppers, peelers are all there because they are dedicated to providing healthy nourishing food for refugees so that displaced people can feel human in such demoralising circumstances.</span></p><p><u><b>A bit more about RCK from RCK</b></u></p><p>""Since 2015 something extraordinary has happened when thousands of fellow human beings have come close to home needing help, we have got up and helped and whilst doing that we have unintentionally created a new way of helping that’s accessible to all. A revolutionary way of helping that provides humanity and nourishment to hungry and vulnerable people creating a connected and kinder world &amp; our mission is to give highly nutritional food support to displaced people whatever their situation.
