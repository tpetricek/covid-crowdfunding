to increasing demand. We are facing an unprecedented challenge and so any donation will be warmly welcomed as we continue to support people most in need.    I am Rev Carol Bostridge  Senior Project Manager of Lewisham Foodbank  I live in Sydenham and have been employed part-time by the Foodbank for 5 years.

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.    All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.    If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free. Thankyou for your support.    The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need  providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.    All the best    Jack Monroe. "

industry  from editors  booksellers and authors  to publicists  agents and designers  are donating money to go towards helping the acute crisis in poverty and hunger amongst the least well off in the country.    We live in a nation where more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. The Trussell Trust has given out over 1.6 million packs of food supplies in the past year alone. Food Banks are not just a place to pick up essential sustenance  with cuts to community centres and frontline services they have also become mini-welfare and advice centres.    We're aiming to raise £5000 before Christmas 2019  which will go to the Trussell Trust. Your donation will directly help those most in need of support. It is vital that those working in publishing come together as a community and take action.    It is important to help those in greatest need but solutions must also be found to the reasons people find themselves in need of food banks.    The Trussell Trust’s CEO Emma Revie has indicated that the benefits system has been driving a rise in foodbank use– the charity released their State of Hunger 2019 report in November.    “This is the busiest six months we’ve ever seen – more people than ever before are being forced to foodbanks’ doors ” said Revie. “Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty  but currently thousands of women  men and children are not receiving sufficient protection from destitution. This is not right. But we know this situation can be fixed – our benefits system could be the key to unlocking people from poverty. We need to put money back into the pockets of people who most need our support. It’s in our power as a country to end the need for foodbanks. This can change.”        Thank you for your support.

It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Robin Hood Fund has launched to support our city and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.    The Robin Hood Fund     Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.    In Nottingham we have a famous history of looking after one another. You could call it the spirit of Robin Hood - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.     So we are creating something called the Robin Hood Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.     Our city has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Robin Hood Fund has been set up for us to shine a light on these vital projects and help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.     Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that if possible you donate and contribute to the common good of Nottingham. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.    The spirit of Robin Hood has created something unique in our city  now is the time to reignite that spirit so please donate today if you can and if you can’t please help us spread the word.      * * *    FAQs    What can I do?    Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the vulnerable.     Where have funds been used?    Since the Robin Hood Fund started we have always had one goal  to raise as much money as possible to help those most in need.     To date; the following causes have been supported;     Since the Robin Hood Fund launched we have had one clear goal  to raise much needed funds to support the most vulnerable people in Nottingham during the Covid-19 crisis. Following an amazing response from the people and organisations of our city we have already exceeded all expectations in raising more than £75 000 which has been distributed - or is in the process of being distributed - to a number of charities and organisations undertaking such important work during these difficult times.      To date; the following causes have been supported:      Foodbanks (£20 000)    The Robin Hood Fund has distributed £20 000 in support of food banks across Nottingham. Working closely with Hope Nottingham and Nottingham Forest in the Community to deliver the wider support  food and supplies have been centrally purchased and then distributed to a number of different food banks  including: NG11 Clifton Foodbank  Meadows Foodbank  Grace Church  HOPE Nottingham  Bestwood & Bulwell Foodbank  Himmah / Muslim Hands  Arnold Foodbank and St. Ann’s Advice Centre.      Homeless Organisations (£10 000)    Emmanuel House was awarded £6 000 for additional specialist key worker support to boost its team at a time when Nottingham’s homeless community is at grave risk. This support is helping to ensure the homeless community are being placed into hotel accommodation as an emergency measure as hostels are very vulnerable to outbreaks.       There has also been £4 000 of support released to Framework to enable them to purchase essential items to the Homeless community in Nottingham. This included  but was not limited to  the provision of items such as mobile phones so that they can remain in contact with key workers and minimise the chance of these individuals being unable to stick to the government guidelines on social distancing.       Refugee Groups (£2 500)    Refugee Roots were provided with support to allow them to move from a model that required face to face contact  to being able to still provide support in a safe and socially distanced way.      In addition  Refugee Forum has been provided with funding for a destitution fund to ensure those with no access to support in other places can still get support.       Vulnerable Women (£4 500)    Nottingham Women's Centre have been awarded funding to help them to provide mental health support and online counselling  including training for counsellors to be able to provide online support.      In addition to this  further support was provided to POW Nottingham  an organisation supporting the rights of sex workers and those at risk of being exploited. This funding enabled them to purchase essential items including food and toiletries.      Disability Groups (£2 500)      With social distancing measures causing increased issues for the disability community in Nottingham  this support has enabled the Disability Support Nottingham organisation to increase its capability to provide phone support - in addition to welfare checks - to those in need.      Vulnerable Young People (£2 500)     Funding has also been provided to help support the amazing work of Nottingham YMCA  who are working with the most vulnerable young people in our city during this crisis. The support has helped to provide food and toiletries to those housed in supported YMCA and transitional accommodation.      Where will the funds go?    The most vulnerable people during this crisis and will be administered by the city council and delivered by people and organisations across the city that can help the most vulnerable.    Every Monday Nottingham City Council will administer the release of funds from GoFundMe to Nottingham City Council bank account. This means Nottingham City Council should  on average  have the money in the bank no later than Friday of every week.    Once in Nottingham City Council account the funds are ring fenced and held until the decision re: allocation has been made.    A working group  chaired by Lee Walker  will be set up to recommend how that branch of funds is released. This group is tasked with making the biggest impact possible whilst also being certain that the organisations in receipt a) need and b) promise to spend quickly ie. nobody saves the money. On Tuesday of each week the working group will have a paper approved by a member of ‘gold’ and paperwork will be sent to a small governance committee who are tasked with ethics and assuring the highest standards of governance and distribution.    Remotely the governance group will scrutinise and approve. Once approved Nottingham City Council agrees to distribute as agreed.    Money will then go out asap so groups and organisations are in receipt within 5 days. A one page press note to support and communication online to be transparent.      If I do donate will it go to those who need it?     Yes  100% of any donation will go to those who need it.    I want to help my local community; will this money be spent in Nottingham?     Yes.

We are a group of 30 households who have been inspired by the efforts of others to raise awareness for racial inequality and thought we would do our bit to fight against racism in our society. 'Our bit' consists of running the distance of a marathon (whilst observing social distancing) along our road in Bristol for charity.     Our aim is to run/jog/walk 293 lengths of our road (equal to 26.2 miles) for Stopwatch and another charity (see our other webpage that supports Bristol North West Foodbank). Our age range spans from 2 years old to 74 years old with a mix of fitness levels!     Please help support us by donating to Stopwatch one of our chosen charities.     StopWatch is a coalition  which works to:    Promote effective  accountable and fair policing  Inform the public about the use of stop and search  Develop and share research on stop and search and alternatives  Organise awareness raising events and forums  Provide legal support challenging stop and search      Since forming in 2010  StopWatch has led a wide-ranging campaign against the disproportionate use of stop and search  the increasing use of exceptional stop and search powers and the weakening of accountability mechanisms. This includes legal and policy analysis  media coverage and commentary  political advocacy  litigation  submissions to national and international organisations and community organising. The unique mix of academics  activists  young people and lawyers has proved effective at challenging the current use of the tactic and drawing attention to the realities for those on the receiving end of police powers.

51","    Can you help us make over 200 000 meals in just 100 days?        The delicious food will be cooked and prepared by Community Response Kitchen  an entirely unpaid volunteer team  in Wembley and reach thousands of NHS  key workers and vulnerable groups across Brent  Ealing  Hertforshire and east London. We are now also helping evicted international students working alongside Educating Beyond Borders with food  essentials and accommodation. These students have no families here to fall back on and are being evicted so we supply them with hot meals  snacks for their journeys  essentials for when they move to new accommodation and we also transport them to the airport at all hours.      Just six weeks ago  Daksha Varsani and her husband Paresh Jethwa decided to cook 50 meals a week for NHS key workers. The emotional reaction and gratitude of the staff convinced Daksha and Paresh to go MUCH further.      The response of the local community has been incredible and their entirely volunteer team has grown to over 50 people  distributing over 2 000 daily meals. They have now prepared and distributed over 87 000 gifts.      But they can’t continue without your help.        FUNDRAISING    The food supply has proved so popular that Daksha and her team now need to fundraise to secure a reliable supply of quality food at bargain wholesale prices to go alongside donated produce. They would also like to diversify some of the food offering. They also need to meet running costs of their operation (see below).        The goal of their new fundraising campaign is to raise £100 000 – this is just 50p towards the cost of what would usually be a £3 meal prepared by an entirely unpaid volunteer team of 50 people.        Daksha explains “Our Community Response Kitchen is driven by love for our community and compassion for those that need help. While we’ve been overwhelmed by the kindness of so many we know that to do more we need to raise money to cover running costs and also ensure we provide a range of balanced  delicious and nutritious food seven days a week”.         · £10 would help sponsor fresh rice and fruit/veg for 20 meals.    · £20 will enable an unpaid driver to cover the cost of delivery petrol for a day.    · £50 would sponsor three 10kg bags of wholesale rice – enough rice for 450 meals!!        Financial donations will go towards the purchase of food that cannot be sourced by donations with contributions also to:    - Renting premises and kitchen space  - Utility bills   - Procurement of ingredients to prepare meals (we will continue to try and secure food donations where possible)  - Packaging – needed daily   - PPE for volunteers – masks  sanitisers  gloves  shoe covers   - Food Safety and hygiene items for volunteers – hair nets  first aid bands  aprons   - Cleaning materials – Antibacterial and Anti-Viral sprays and wipes  soap  - Periodic professional deep cleaning of premises   - Volunteer Driver Expense – donation towards fuel and parking if required   - Office consumables – E.g. Labels  paper  toner                For pictures of the amazing Community Response Kitchen  please visit @communityresponsekitchen on Facebook or on Instagram .        All food prepared at KSL Heather Park Community Hall  Alperton is certified  with local authority registration  food hygiene certificates and insurance.

We really look forward to the delicious meals every day”.        Giles Deards  Trustee of Queens Park-based refugee support charity  Salusburv World  said “When we first heard of a wife and husband making free food we thought it might be for a week or two. Now dozens of charities across Brent receive hundreds of meals every week  including Salusbury World  four local schools  Fresh Horizons Foodbank  Queens Park Community Hub  Rumi’s Kitchen  the Avenues  mutual aid groups and the new Willesden Mutual Aid Foodbank. It’s about even more than the food; Daksha has inspired us. Salusbury World volunteers have now set up two new food initiatives in Queens Park. We’re delighted to be helping the fundraising for this campaign”.        James Carson of Hillingdon Crisis said “Daksha and her team have saved our charity from closure providing us with wide variety of items  a lot of invaluable advice and contacts to help us out. They are an amazing group of very special people”.        Andy Lambell of Just Homes in Newham said “Just Homes runs seven hostels for homeless people in Newham and we would have really struggled to stay open if it hadn’t been for the food from Community Response Kitchen five days a week. We’d like to thank Daksha and her team for doing an incredible job”.        Shereen Sherry of Acton Mutual Aid said “we are in awe of the Community Response Kitchen and how they magically supply us with 400 weekly meals at a time to help feed the elderly  vulnerable and those in financial hardship across Acton. The meals are delicious and carefully labelled and packaged. It’s clear what we receive is the outcome of a labour of love. Just amazing!”          "

That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks  supported by The Trussell Trust  working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.    ABOUT OUR FOODBANK  An introduction to the Morecambe Bay Foodbank project.  Morecambe Bay Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. It began life at the GYM Church on Green Street in Morecambe and has now moved to The West End Community Centre on Westminster Road in Morecambe. We receive and distribute over six tonnes of food each month and our operation has been growing since its inception in 2012.     We have a small staff team led by our Foodbank Manager  Annette Smith  and over eighty regular volunteers who give up their time to help us each week.    ABOUT  HOW FOODBANKS WORK  Providing emergency food to people in crisis.  Every day people in the UK go hungry for reasons ranging from redundancy to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems.    FOOD IS DONATED  Schools  churches  businesses and individuals donate non-perishable  in-date food to a foodbank. Large collections often take place as part of Harvest Festival celebrations and food is also collected at supermarkets.    FOOD IS SORTED AND STORED  Volunteers sort food to check that it’s in date and pack it into boxes ready to be given to people in need. Over 40 000 people give up their time to volunteer at foodbanks.    PROFESSIONALS IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN NEED  Foodbanks partner with a wide range of care professionals such as doctors  health visitors  social workers and police to identify people in crisis and issue them with a foodbank voucher.    CLIENTS RECEIVE FOOD  Foodbank clients bring their voucher to a foodbank centre where it can be redeemed for three days’ emergency food. Volunteers meet clients over a warm drink or free hot meal and are able to signpost people to agencies able to solve the longer-term problem."

desperate poverty. I was eventually referred to a food bank  where I survived for six months on kindness and donated tins and packets. I started to write about my experiences online  and haven't stopped since. I now write cookery books teaching people to cook on the smallest of budgets and smallest of kitchens. I work with food banks  charities  homelessness shelters  and campaign against austerity and for decent jobs and wages.     Tin Can Cook is my fourth cookbook  and I insisted on writing it  partly as an entry-level cookbook for people who have never learned to cook  but mostly to restore some dignity to a food bank box. To give people choices  and agency  and good food  and resources. Tin Can Cook is a book of 75 easy  fun  delicious recipes  made from tin cans! Recipes include Carrot Cake Overnight Oats from a tin of carrots  Tinned Spud Fishcakes  a Chicken And Ham Pie  lots of curries  Cherry Chocolate Fudge  and how to cook pasta from a kettle or microwave. Tin Can Cook has received a lot of encouragement since it was first announced  with Jay Rayner from the Guardian describing it as 'both a brilliant thing and necessary'  and support from Tom Parker Bowles  Ryan Riley from LifeKitchen  Nigella Lawson  and an article in the Telegraph.    I have donated my previous books to food banks and told them they can photocopy the pages to hand out to their clients  and they have done so in their thousands. I have made thousands of recipe cards to hand out to food bank users in conjunction with Oxfam and the Trussell Trust. But I want to do more.    I want this book to reach as many people as it needs to. I'm not in this to make money - the royalties for an author are laughably piteous  7-10% of the RRP - so this isn't about flogging books. It's about giving people hope  dignity  and decent meals in the most dire of situations. And you can help.    At the moment  the retail price for Tin Can Cook is £6.99. I also need to factor in postage  packaging  and administrative costs. (I have done a Kickstarter before and ended up personally very out of pocket for not accurately factoring in postage costs  so I am being over cautious with my calculations  as it is better to overdeliver than disappoint. If I do find a way to get around the postage costs to deliver to approximately 400 different locations  I will donate the difference directly to the Trussell Trust and let you know).    I am also in conversation with corporate sponsors to see if they would match the books donated by you  which would be fantastic!    So  with postage  admin costs  packaging  and all that nonsense  at the moment I estimate that for every £9 raised  one book and three tins will be donated to a foodbank. (If this changes for any reason  and it shouldn't  I will let you know).    Books will be evenly distributed throughout the Trussell Trust network of food banks across the whole of the UK - you can find the areas that they cover here: https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/find-a-foodbank/ (but it's pretty much all of them!)    And what do I get out of this? Well to be honest  not much at all. But that's not what I'm doing it for. I wish I was rich enough to just donate a million books for every food bank user in Britain  every family in poverty  every school  every library  but I just earn the Living Wage (yes  really) and some months even that's a bit hairy  so I can't do this by myself. But you can help.     I know £9 is a lot of money to some people  so pledges start at £5  meaning you can co-fund a book with another donor. For every £9 raised  one book and three tins will be donated to a food bank  and they will go to a family or a person who would be at risk of starving without emergency food help.

The Trussell Trust currently operate 420 food banks across the UK. Here's a breakdown of where the money raised here will go.    If we raise £3 780  every Trussell Trust food bank in the UK can receive one copy of Tin Can Cook to photocopy and hand out the photocopies to their clients - I've waived the copyright for food banks  they can copy it to their hearts content. I did this with previous books and foodbank managers said it made a real difference. And 1260 tins of food will be donated across the UK to feed people in need.    If we raise £7 560  every Trussell Trust food bank in the UK will receive two copies of the book  and 2 520 tins of food will be donated.    If we raise £37 800  every TT food bank in the UK will receive ten copies of Tin Can Cook  to distribute to 4 200 food bank users  and 12 600 tins of food will be donated across the UK to feed people who would be at risk of going hungry otherwise.    To give a book and a parcel of tins to every food bank user in Britain  we would need to raise around £7m. So every donation counts. Every single donation counts. If you can't afford to donate  please share on your social media instead - it's free!     If you have any further questions  or for press enquiries  please get in touch on [email redacted] and I or my admin angel  Caroline  will get back to you.

But the coronavirus epidemic will be a massive challenge for them  on a whole new scale. More and more people are going to need their help over the next few months.    People on zero hours contracts won't get paid.    Food will need to be delivered to the elderly and sick who are self-isolating.    If schools close  many children will lose their main meal and need to be fed.    And all this is happening at a time when the rest of us are going to the supermarket less and - let's be honest - thinking about our own food cupboards first.    So  here's a very simple way to help. You give money. Every time we get to £100 I ask the foodbank what they need most and go and get it. If things get really bad  I will organise a delivery. We all keep doing this over and over again until things get better.      Why aren't Fair Frome doing this? Well  they've got a heck of a lot on their plate right now and this is one way I can take the load off them. It's also easier for me to set up a fundraiser as an individual.    Who am I anyway? Good question  I have volunteered for the food bank before  and here I am with Lenka  their co-ordinator  in the food bank. Fair Frome know that I am making this appeal and are very happy to have the fundraising happen.      I will post the receipt on here every time I go shopping.    But if you're still worried  please do take some food to the Fair Frome collection points in Sainsburys  Asda  Frome Wholefoods and Barnardos instead.       Frome is a great community. Let's channel this and do our best to see all our town through the next few months.    "

As it is has been cancelled  The Blue Blades have challenged HUBC to a race on the weekend of June 13th and June 14th. (The date of Durham Regatta) We will be racing the distance by foot and/or bike of 260 miles/419km  the distance from Hull to Durham and back.    All proceeds will be going to The Trussell Trust  a charity which provides emergency food and support to people locked in poverty  as well as leading a campaign for change to end the need for food banks in the U.K. With the current COVID-19 pandemic  food banks are a vital resource and are experiencing a significant rise of people using their services  so every penny raised will go a long way.     The Blue Blades are an alumni group from Hull University Boat Club.     More information about The Trussell Trust: The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion.

We value all our supporters who make a big difference. We provide three days’ emergency food and support to local families and people in crisis.     Covid19 is impacting Rhondda Foodbank in the following ways:    1. Increased demand across the Rhondda with prospects of getting worse.    2. Reduction in food donations because of the change in shopping habits.    3. Self-isolation of some of our regular volunteers.    Our goal with your support is to ensure that no-one in the Rhondda goes hungry during this crisis.     For more information about the Rhondda Foodbank visit our website here.

We are a group of 30 households who have been inspired by the efforts of others to raise money for those people affected by Covid19 and thought we would do our bit to help. 'Our bit' consists of running the distance of a marathon (whilst observing social distancing) along our road in Bristol for charity.     Our aim is to run/jog/walk 293 lengths of our road (equal to 26.2 miles) for Bristol North West Foodbank and another charity (see our other webpage that supports Stopwatch). Our age range spans from 2 years old to 74 years old with a mix of fitness levels!     Please help support us by donating to Bristol North West Foodbank one of our chosen charities.     Your donations to Bristol North West Foodbank will not only help the charity give out food  but also provide signposting help to other services as well as offer access to the Fuel Bank   Our Foodbank Advice Service and our Cookery and budgeting course  “Eat Well  Spend Less”.     For further details of this worthy charity please click on the link below.    https://www.bristolnorthwestfoodbank.org.uk    We would like to offer our sympathy to those that have been affected by Covid during this difficult time.

nhs staff for food  accommodation and whatever else needed  and putting back into the community for food banks for families unable to work So lockdown is now upon us all so I thought of a way of raising money for nhs frontline staff and foodbanks for families unable to work  And a way to keep people smiling  So..... nominate a friend to shave there hair ( it’ll grow back by the time we’re out of this sh#t ) They name there price  Check the link to see if they’ve donated And shave it !!!!! Please copy and share and let’s see how much we can raise for this much needed cause and have a barrel of laughs along the way. Before and after pics will make it so much funnier "

Funds raised are to be shared equally between two much needed food projects in our communities  these being Lumley Methodist Church who are cooking and delivering over 115 hot meals twice a week and Bournmoor  Fence Houses & Woodstone Foodbank who are delivering many many food parcels throughout our villages. Both projects are much needed in these challenging times for vulnerable people and families in need  over 30 volunteers are involved in total across both projects.  Both Tommy & Kevin live locally and are passionate about their communities  their 10k run will take place on Saturday 9th May  to make things a little more challenging Tommy will be wearing a weighted top and Kevin will be in uniform complete with stab proof vest.  Any support at all that can be given will be very much appreciated by all in this amazing fundraiser  every little helps. Kind regards  Alan"

I've got a receding hairline as it is  so what looks like a ridiculous haircut on Ronaldo will look even more ridiculous on me.    SO  open your wallets to as much as you can  even if it's just a quid or two. If you don't like the idea of the haircut  donate just to make sure it was worth it- for Kristine's sake!    I'll be looking to get this done by Easter Sunday (12th April)    Funds raised will be paid directly to   https://www.catshillbaptist.org.uk/cbc-foodbank-2/      Thanks guys!"

We have been operating since 2012 in London and became a charity in March 2020. Information about SWAN can be found on our website www.swanlondon.org. We run a foodbank and provide community support to many Refugee and migrant families in London. We have also been providing aid to refugees in Camp Moria since 2018 in partnership with Kitrinos Healthcare and Team Humanity who are both charities registered to work in Greece. We have collected  sent (via container) and provided vital humanitarian aid to Refugees in Moria camp including food parcels  baby milk  nappies  clothes  shoes and blankets and documented the distributions on social media (WhatsApp). Team Humanity are our implementing partner on the ground and they have distributed regular food parcels to new arrivals on our behalf. In recent months there has been a dramatic increase in the number of new arrivals and conditions are horrendous. Many families are living in inhumane conditions with little or new food. Since November 2019 SWAN - with the help of TEAM HUMANITY has been providing bread (which is prepared by Refugees) in the camp to starving refugees in and outside Moria Camp. The cost of preparing each bread is 40 cents. €400 provides 1000 breads. There are currently 21 000+ refugees in Moria and many new arrivals have no funds and the queues are so long for the food provided by the Greek authorities and local charities that many get nothing. All funds received for this campaign will be sent to our implementing partner Team Humanity to pay for preparation and distribution of the bread. The ground team send pictures of each distribution to SWAN which we share with donors for transparency. The bread we distribute is often all they will eat. SWAN aim to provide bread three times a week - £1200. If we could do more we would. But we are a small charity dependent on your support. Please give generously and help us  help and feed them."

We know money is extra-tight for some families at the moment  so please give what you can or if you can’t give  please share the GoFundMe with others. On this note  we would like to donate half the proceeds of this appeal to the Boston Foodbank (c/o reg charity 1138045 Parish of Boston)This is to help our health service with wider public health at this time  as people who can eat well are stronger and have better immune systems to fight off infection. Also feedback from some healthcare workers is that they really appreciate the public support  but feel well-paid. So they would like people to help those less well-off in our community.     Thank you and please help us not only reach our target ASAP  but also go beyond so we can provide more care packs  and also donate to other foodbanks in the Pilgrim catchment area if we smash our target!

I am running the Liverpool half marathon in March in support of South Liverpool Foodbank. Why have I chosen this particular cause? Here are some numbers...    - More than 11 000 people used SL Foodbank last year  - One in three children in Liverpool are growing up in poverty. In some areas of the city region  that rises above 50%.  - In the 2019 Indices of Deprivation  Liverpool ranked 2nd in England for highest proportion of neighbourhoods classed among the 10% most deprived nationally.    Food banks really shouldn't have to exist  but we have a government in this country which systematically perpetuates poverty and inequality  so sadly they're an absolute necessity for millions of people to live.     It might be 21km worth of pain on the day  but it will be for a very important and worthwhile cause. Anything you can give is greatly appreciated.     https://southliverpool.foodbank.org.uk/"

The need for supplies is greater than ever!     Coronavirus is spreading  so is the hunger.     Everyone is buying online now so whatever they used to collect from collection points now they can’t. Everyone is buying (bought) in bulk so now a lot of things are not in stock in the shops.     In honour of welcoming Ramadhan I thought to call Manchester Central Food Bank and ask if they needed anything. I went shopping and delivered the items to the foodbank today (Thursday 23rd April).       But  even with a budget of £200  I did not manage to buy even a quarter of the things that the Food Bank needed. I realised quickly I cannot do it alone. The volunteers are already spending their own money but that’s only 10% of the donations. The other 90% comes from public donations which at the moment is very low.     If you want to give out in charity because of the blessed month of Ramadhan then this is your chance too.     Make sure you donate and help us provide essential food for our local community in Manchester Foodbank.    £10 can buy 5 - 10 items  £20 can buy 10 to 20 items  £50 can buy 30 to 55 items  £100 can buy 55 to 85 items    Thank you for supporting me in helping our community.     Thank you on behalf of Manchester Central FoodBank and everyone that will benefit from the Food Bank.     Find a Food Bank    Stay safe always.     Najma    UPDATE:  I did another food shop on Thursday (30th April). We bought items worth £450 and delivered to the Foodbank. We had a small car and so we could not spend all the money on this day.     We will be doing the Third Big Shop on Thursday (7th May) with the leftover but this time I have partnered with Bankeut and they will do the shop and delivery on my behalf for free.     I’ll also be doing live daily recipe demos on Instagram (sikiacooking) and/or Facebook (sikiacooking) from Sunday (3rd of May) to Saturday (9th May). Simple recipe ideas to try at home."

I'm raising money in aid of Malmesbury and District Foodbank and every donation will help. This Sunday (19th April) I will be doing a full Ironman Triathlon in my garden. This will involve me swimming in a paddling pool for about 1.5 hours  cycling 112 miles on a static Wattbike and then running 26.2 miles - which will be around 420 laps of my garden.    For the swim I will be tethered so will be static... think of it as 1.5 hours of front crawl but never being able to reach the end of the pool    I am starting at 7am and hope to finish my 7pm!    Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to me. So far I have raised around £400 via Facebook and PayPal but know a few people have had some issues with these platforms so have brought it together here    More information about Malmesbury and District Foodbank: Malmesbury and District Foodbank provides emergency food parcels to those in food poverty. We rely entirely on donations  grants and gifts and are a registered charity and part of the Trussell Trust network of nationwide foodbanks "

The disease has led to measures beyond our wildest imaginations  including orders for self-isolation  concerns over the ability of public services to cope  major impacts on local business  and emergency legislation.    While no one has been spared from the fallout  there are certain groups who especially need our support. One of them is The Trussell Trust  which runs 428 food banks across the UK to provide emergency food to those in crisis.    The Trussell Trust and other food banks are under strain  with panic-buying and stockpiling only making things worse. Food donations have dropped sharply  especially some essential items  so the Trust now needs to buy them to make sure people coming to its food banks have what they most need. No-one should have to rely on a foodbank but the number of people depending on them is likely to increase because of the hardship caused by job losses and business closures as a result of the coronavirus​.    That’s why I am appealing for donations to The Trussell Trust  to help them ensure that the most disadvantaged in our society have enough to eat..      I know these are deeply worrying times  but I also know that we have the ability to pull together to get through this crisis. Together we can make sure that no-one is left behind.     Thank you for whatever you can give.    Sincerely      Caroline Lucas MP"

The Food Bank provides a vital service to the local population and the wider Bradford area. The restrictions we are all experiencing make it harder for people to donate actual food  but we want to give people the opportunity to give cash instead.    Although the fund-raising page says donations will go straight to Michael Faulkner  who is secretary of Churches Together in Ilkley  in fact of course money will go directly to the Foodbank ."

We are raising money to help provide a free meal to those people and families In Dunfermline who are struggling at this difficult time.     Dunfermline Foodbank is doing a wonderful job as is ""Food for your Future."" However  there is still a great need. Some parents struggling with stress  anxiety and mental health even find it difficult to prepare a meal.    We are aiming to provide 100 FREE meals per day to those who are in need. We are collaborating with local High Schools and primary schools to get the offer to those who could do with a little helping hand right now.    Sometimes the hardest thing for us all to do is to receive a little helping hand from time to time. We are all in this together and we are coming together to try and help in some small way. The sharing of what we have with others is what binds communities together and makes them stronger.    With that in mind we are offering free meals to those in need on a TRIAL 6 DAY period from Tuesday 12th May to Sunday 17th of May.    This had been funded by generous donations and by the Vine church because we all #loveDunfermline.    We are also looking into applying for government funding to do this on a medium to long-term basis.    If you would like to help us keep this service available please consider donating toward our fund.     If you would like to volunteer please do so here    If you want to take advantage of the free meals  or have a friend or family who would want to use this service please click here   Click to register for free meal"

This brought an end 85 years of football under the club's name.    In April 2019  however  we celebrated the establishment of North Ferriby F.C. as the successor club to North Ferriby United. Les and Gill Hare  after 4 years away   have returned to create a new club which will start this season in the Northern Counties East League Division One. It'll be great to have community football back in the village!     As it turns out  2019 is the centenary of football in the village  so we have lots to celebrate.    We at View from the Allotment End   North Ferriby F.C.'s independent fanzine  are seeking to raise funds for the club and our chosen charity for issue 12 of our magazine Hull Foodbank  which is part of the Trussell Trust.    The first game of the new club will be a pre-season friendly against local friends and rivals  Barton Town F.C on 6th July 2019. A number of us fans are planning to walk the 6.5 miles from North Ferriby  across the Humber Bridge  to Barton Town to watch the match (K.O. 3pm). We expect it will take about 2-2.5 hours.     As part of this we are seeking your kind sponsorship. All money raised will be split equally between North Ferriby F.C. and the Hull Foodbank.    Also  we welcome anyone along who wishes to join us - Ferriby fans  football fans  or fans of a good walk over the finest bridge in the world. Final details are being confirmed but we expect to leave North Ferriby in the late morning. If you wish to join us please e-mail Matthew Kempson so we can keep you informed - [email redacted]. We will also post updates on our Twitter and on here. We are considering arrangements to get back :)    And of course  we would welcome supporters down to North Ferriby F.C. this coming season. Up the Villagers!    Finally  please do check out the great work that Hull Foodbank undertake and help them directly if you can. In the year 2017-18  for example  they provided an amazing 5100 three-day emergency supplies of food to people in crisis within the Hull area.    Thank you for your very kind support.    Matthew"

London may not be having a marathon this year  but Didsbury will! Not only that but  collectively  the residents plan on beating the current ""official"" world record of just over 2 hours while also adhering to strict social distancing measures!    We'd love your support. Please sponsor/donate what ever you can  all monies raised will go directly to Burnage Foodbank.    Here's how we will ensure Social Distancing:    This event is for residents only. Unfortunately non residents will not be able to spectate as there is no where to put them while ensuring social distancing.    Key points - Warm up (outside YOUR OWN) house from 9:45am    1st leg starts 10am – Participants will be notified of their group and approx. start time by Whats app!    The race will follow VERY STRICT SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES  to do this we really need all cars etc to be off the road by 9am on Sunday 26th so the road can be used as the course. We appreciate this can be tricky especially where homes have more than one car. To help  we have contacted The Parrswood Pub to see if we could perhaps park in their car park. If this is something that may be of interest/use to you  please let me know so I can confirm details.    Participants be they  Walking/Jogging or Running will start outside their own house (level with their left fence post) they will step onto the road/the course and will then will travel in an anti-clockwise direction  going down one side then up the other. Their lap (s) will finish when they return to their house. This will mean people are kept safe and social distancing will be adhered to at all times! Partipants will use the outside of the road allowing a 2m gap between them and runners running on the other side of the road.     Participants  participate at their own risk.     The footpath will act as a barrier between runners and those spectating/supporting from their drive. Supporters  please ensure you are a minimum of 2meters away from where participants will be passing ie. A minimum of 2 meters from the curb.    3 or 4 people (or in some cases 3 couples or 3 families will participate at the same time) participants will be in groups (allowing for social distancing) and will be given a start time. 1 lap is 451 meters so this will more than allow for social distancing between each participant/houshold. Those running with children under 10  should hold their hand when participating to prevent trips/falls and ensure they don’t jeopardise social distancing measures.    Participants will be categorised (by themselves) into Walkers/Potterers ie. Joggers with kids under 10years  Joggers and Runners and will participate (at their allocated slot) with others in the same category. Overtaking shouldn’t be an issue anyway but to be clear  participants will NOT be allowed to overtake!    Any questions please ask."

The fall off in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that we have had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased our costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries. All donations will go directly to purchasing items for food parcels.

We have a responsibility to our staff  our punters and the general public.     We are now concentrating our efforts in supplying food parcels to the vulnerable in our community. This is done through our charity The Clutha Trust. Our premises at 100 Morrison St Glasgow has been converted to a distribution centre. We make up over 500 food parcels per week which are then delivered to the community via our charity partners - The Swamp Pollok - Gorbals Housing association - South East foodbank - Spirit Aid - Lights on G1 - Refuweege - City Mission     Please help - all money raised will buy food. We are all volunteers - no money donated goes to any running costs - every penny buys food     These are tough and challenging times but we the Clutha family have come through difficult times before and if we stand together we can come through this."

In light of COVID-19  we are finding many families are:   • In isolation  unable to access basic necessities  • Are vulnerable  with pre-existing conditions  • Left unemployed and unable to put food on the table    EMB is dedicating itself to ensuring no one in our community is left behind.     We have started collecting food donations and delivering food parcels to the most vulnerable through our network of amazing volunteers. We have been taken back by the number of people requiring help.     We've partnered up with Tesco  Marks & Spencers & The Corner Cake Shop who are providing any excess stock they can give away. We have a wonderful community that has been generously purchasing a little extra with their weekly shop and kindly donating it to the cause  but unfortunately  we are still lacking some vital resources.    We want to raise £1 000 to be able to purchase food directly ourselves and provider our team of volunteers with the correct PPC gear while they are out making donations.     No one is sure how long this lockdown will last  and it will get worse before it's better. We will be running this service to at least the next three months. If the crisis lasts longer  we will continue until we see fit.     EMB is a not-for-profit organisation - every penny goes directly back into providing resources. If you can't financially donate  please considering dropping off any fresh or long-life food to our HQ on Molesworth Road.     If you'd like to volunteer and help out within the community  please join our Facebook group - Mid Ulster Corona Virus Community Support Network    Now more than ever  we must look out for each other and protect those in the community that require help. Please consider donating your time  money or talent to this cause.     "

5","Christmas is one of the toughest times of the year for lots of people. Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland. Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen feed people seven days a week and will now be able to buy pallets of fresh produce to cook with  whilst the foodbank will be able to use the money to produce emergency three day food parcels.

who have been struggling since the Coronavirus outbreak. Last week alone  they helped 285 families and they expect this to increase in the coming weeks. Some of our players and friends of the club  will run a combined total of 200km in one day (this Saturday 2nd of May)  and each individual will contribute with either a 5km or 10km  also ensuring the governments social distancing guidelines are adhered to. (Runners will go out on their own) We would encourage family members  pals  work colleagues to join in and/or donate. We’re aiming to do something positive for the community by helping those who are less fortunate in difficult times. If you can spare a few quid then it would go a long way! Thank you."

We at CIG are very lucky people  we work for a company that cares for us and pays us and allows us to work from home.     With the care packages sent out i was thinking that there must be a lot of needy people needing support with food and care during this trying time and rather than sit there and wait for someone to help i decided to start this charity drive to earn a little of money to give to the stockport foodbank charity  they currently have 7 locations in stockport and help all people who are in need of extra  not just during this trying time but always.

I am raising money for the Foodbank NI and CAP (Christians Against Poverty) service in TLC compassion centre in newtownards. The Foodbank provide vital food packs for people who find themselves in various difficult circumstances. It is estimated that 1 in 5 people in Northern Ireland live below the poverty line. As a result an increasing number of people in Northern Ireland  and across the UK  rely on the emergency food supplies provided by food banks. The CAP centre help people find a practical  lasting solution to debt and poverty. Living in debt and poverty is a daily grinding battle. But together we can transform lives.  Anything you can donate would seriously help people in these circumstances feel loved and find hope again   many thanks   Lyns"

Our local community urgently needshelp and support to tackle one of the very basic but very real challenges they are facing; that of feeding their families.     Some young people and their families live in poverty all year round  but we are finding  because of the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis  so many more are contacting us because they’re struggling with increased pressures on their household budgets. People who are battling with job losses  reduction in their incomes  wait times/not being eligible to receive benefits  an increase in utility bills etc during lockdown and ultimately children that go hungry. There are also vulnerable people in our community that need help; ie elderly  disabled  those shielding for health reasons or in self isolation who haven’t got anyone else to help them. We know these impacts will be felt long term.    Every penny you donate counts. It will help us achieve our foodbank project’s aims of reducing food poverty and inequality. It will help us tackle some of the very real challenges young people  the disadvantaged and vulnerable in our community are facing right now. Alternatively  you may have or work at a business that can offer us some support or help - if you have any ideas around this  please contact us at [email redacted]    We want to make a difference and help families put healthy food on the table  and we are grateful for any help you can give us to make this happen and make something positive come from this difficult time in the longer term. Thank you so much for your support ❤️    A Bit More About Us and ‘Let’s Eat’ Foodbank:  CFYDC (CHANCE) T/A Chapeltown Youth Development Centre are a Leeds based registered charity (No. 1121341). Our focus is on supporting young people to achieve their fullest potential in life. We do this by offering and subsidising a range of positive diversionary activities such as football  rugby  boxing  education and training opportunities and gang prevention work - regardless of background  race  religion  ethnicity  gender  disability etc. We have a high proportion of BAME community members that attend our centre and we work city wide  but have a focus on helping those in Chapeltown and the other most deprived areas surrounding us in North and North-East Leeds. We have been a part of the community we serve for around 20 years so far and have supported thousands of kids. We only plan for growth so that we can support many  many more young people to achieve their aims and become their best!      CYDC have the premises  the volunteers  the will and determination to deliver this project  not just during lockdown but long term so we can truly make a difference. To achieve this though we need your help to raise the funds to buy essential equipment such as suitable fridge/freezers (approx £2500) so we can receive more food and improve the food parcels  to improve our available storage spaces (costs for this are currently being worked up  but to give you an idea we need an extra storage container  shelving/tables/materials/labour etc)  cover delivery costs for those that can’t come to us because they’re vulnerable/disabled/elderly/isolating etc  to buy bags  gloves  sanitisers etc and to stock up on food and household goods that families in financial crisis need support with getting at this time. We are working in partnership with FareShare Yorkshire.   We want to make a community food store that can make a difference. This is a project that we have begun operating immediately to react to this crisis and meet the growing need for help for families to feed themselves  but also one we want to develop  grow and make sustainable in the long term. Locally and nationally the demand for support in communities to reduce food  child  and working poverty is  sadly  an increasing trend with no signs of slowing. We also want to break down some of the social stigmas in the community that are associated with the use of food banks and make it easier for families to get the help they need.    Usually our charity is able to generate some income through some of our already heavily subsidised youth activities (we offer our activity sessions e.g. football  rubgy  boxing etc for £2 a time) - but this has currently come to a crashing halt to keep people safe! Also a lot of the grants and corporate fundraising methods have been put on hold or are under severe strain due to increased demand. We have to find a different way of fundraising during COVID-19 - and let’s just say Captain Tom was an inspiration to us! So here we are  hoping you can offer your support.    Thanks for reading our appeal. If you can’t donate yourself  maybe you can share our story so someone else might help. Either way  we hope you all stay safe  well and blessed! ❤️ "

We are understandably gutted.

But ideally we would still like to raise the money we would have made in ticket sales from these two gigs to help the two food banks they would have supported.    We have set our target amount roughly at 80% of all available tickets sold to both events which would have been £2 560.

We demand the University of Birmingham:  * Gives an above RPI inflation pay increase to all support staff;  * Becomes a Living Wage Accredited employer;  * Eliminates the gender pay gap by 2020;  * Fixes the Support Staff pay spine & allocates a budget for it;  * Negotiates with all unions on the joint unions' report on working conditions at the university (available on our website).    Hundreds of caterers  cleaners  security guards and other support staff who are members of UNISON at the University of Birmingham are in dispute with the University of Birmingham and have taken strike action on the University's Open Day on Friday 28th June as they feel let down by the University’s senior management. Unless the University of Birmingham's senior managers are prepared to address our demands  we will have no other choice but to continue to take strike action.     This strike is notable within the sector  as this is the only union branch in the Higher Education to succeed in taking strike action over the 18-19 negotiations. This comes after almost a year of failed negotiations over fair pay  living wage accreditation  closing the gender pay gap  and meaningful negotiations on a joint report of demands written together with the other trade unions on campus  says UNISON today. More than three quarters of the university staff balloted (79 per cent) voted in favour of strike action over last year’s dispute.    Senior managers at the University have persistently refused to negotiate with the unions and instead imposed a below inflation pay rise (2%) on the majority of staff. The University has also been sluggish to address the gulf between men and women’s salaries at the institution  with women earning on average less than 20% than their male counterparts  have refused to accredit  and have only been ready to restructure the pay spine if the unions were prepared to agree on worse conditions such as sick pay  overtime pay  and holiday entitlements.    The first day of action was held on Friday 28th June  on a very sunny day which was also the University's Open Day: food  music  and joyful discussions over everyone’s vision of the University are being held  and prospective students and their parents are finding out about the struggles staff are facing on campus.     In the absence of accreditation  pay at the university could fall below the Real Living Wage  meaning staff would struggle to make ends meet. ‘We already know that members have turned to foodbanks to feed their families’  says UNISON. ‘Many low-paid staff only work 15 hours per week and often hold several jobs to make ends meet. Senior managers seem happy to promote the excellent research undertaken by academics on social inequalities but are failing to see that they are often driving this inequality through the way they treat their own employees’.    Last year  the University set up a new ‘wholly-owned subsidiary company’ called the Edgbaston Park Hotel  and outsourced 40 staff. The Hotel does not recognise unions for new members (meaning that they cannot take strike action  for instance)  and new staff are being paid only £8.21/hour. Their contracts are much worse compared to those of the University of Birmingham’s employees. This year  Hotel staff received a 1p/hour pay rise  while the University’s VC earns £444 000/year from the University  is waiting to receive a one-off £80 000 bonus  and also receives £90 000/year as Chair of the academic and academic related staff’s USS pensions scheme.

Our family were in awe by his altruistic desire to give  feed and aid ALL  despite race/ethnicity/religion among him even whilst suffering himself.     Since opening  our family alone have vetted 25 families with monthly food rations from December 2019- present. Unfortunately  25 families do not cover the innumerable amount of people starving  for whom we want to share some light  hope and nurture to amidst dark times  that is their indefinite reality.    Our foodbank prioritises poor families with children  single mothers/widowers and those who themselves or their children suffer with debilitating mental/physical health issues trying to make ends meet to provide for their children- this is done with rigorous checks by our team to ensure nobody exploits such a service. The families are issued with a monthly ration card valid for 12 months which provides them with stock for each month as per the individual needs of the family. These include: 10kg chapati flour (atta)  5kg sugar  5kg various lentils/daal  5kg rice  5L cooking oil  tea leaves  salt  spices and other necessary food items. £25 will feed a family of 5 for the month however any donation  no matter how big or small will impact them greatly.     100% of the donationsgo to those in need  with our incredible staff being voluntary workers (so no wages or salaries are deducted from donations) and our facilities funded with the finances that the late Safdar Hussain Shah left behind for us to carry this out in his legacy- we are relying on your kind donations which will solely provide stock for the families.     During the current COVID-19 crisis  we are aiming to try and provide emergency food supplies to all those suffering in the locale  with the most vulnerable holding priority  we are giving out thousands of food rations but are broken to see that we are unable to extend our help to everyone that needs it- as a small start-up charity  we are grateful for all the support and donations we receive in order to help us reach as many individuals suffering from the crisis as possible.     Unfortunately  we can't do this alone  with the power of unity together we can help fill the stomachs of the poor  not only with food but also the fulfilment of life and hope they may gradually receive from your donations. Our brothers and sisters around the globe need us  we are united by our efforts.   Any donation  no matter how big or small will be greatly appreciated especially in the blessed month of Ramadan  whereby charity is considered its greatest.     We are not the givers  we are just Allah SWT  the Almighty's  servants and can only give what he allows and wishes to be given. The families we aim to feed is by the grace of Allah SWT and it is he who provides to all.     May Allah SWT accept this from you and me  may we fulfil our duty by helping those in need  for which it is their right upon you and I.    “A man’s true wealth is the good he does in this world.” Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W)    Instagram: sadaqajariya.foodbank for further updates"

We are hoping for 180 people to donate £3.25 each which will pay for enough rice to complete  not one  but two rice challenges!     Every 90kg (90 bags) pays for the farmer in Malawi to send one of his children to secondary school for one year! Education is key in helping families to beat poverty  and a secondary education is so important in helping to achieve that. Sadly  however  this is not an opportunity that is open to all children in Malawi  particularly children in rural  farming communities. We want to help change that by providing farmers with a living income through the sale of their delicious fairly traded rice  as well as giving them the opportunity to send their child to school!    But what are we going to do with all that rice? Every bag purchased will go directly to the Grace Foodbank in Sheffield  which feeds some of the city's most vulnerable and impoverished families.     We know that life is tough for everyone at the moment  but for those in poverty  whether at home or abroad it is even tougher. Why not help two lots of people today and purchase a bag of rice for just £3.25?    Thank you so much for your support!    #fairtradeeveryday"

Each lap is approximately 770 metres  so this will see me cover 100 socially distanced kilometres in 24 hours. All money raised will go to The Trussell Trust #foodbanks    The plan is to run 100 laps on day one between 12 pm and midnight  which will be pretty much back to back marathons. I'll get some sleep  then finish the final 30 laps by midday on the following day. My final lap will be at 11:55 am on the 9th; all being well.... lap number 130.     Due to the current situation food banks are in desperate need of donations  support and help. If you can spare a couple of quid  it would mean the world to both me and this incredible charity. #milesformeals    I'll be posting live updates on Instagram via my mental health support page - Run4YourMind.

A huge drop in food donations coupled with an increase in demand has meant a 50% drop in Warwick District Foodbank's capacity to fill the 160 boxes a week of essential foodstuffs they need to produce.     These cost around £4 500 a week or £18 000 a month.    Please consider making a donation to the Foodbank for as long as the pandemic lasts and share this page in your network. Every penny you contribute will help feed a local family. Together  we can get through this!    Thank you.

We’re using the excess unwanted councillor allowances and generous donations to fund the work.    Now we need your help to make sure we can keep this valuable work going for as long as necessary.    From May 22 ten Labour County Councillors will walk/run/crawl 3.6kms a day over 10 consecutive days to raise money for our Food Out Friday initiative.    We know that people across Norfolk use foodbanks over the year and that’s why we will be completing 365 km to recognise this. The 3.6km a day challenge will ‪start on Friday May 22‬ and run  no pun intended  for 10 consecutive days. By the end we will have clocked up a combined total of 365kms    Food Out Friday delivers food to food banks across Norfolk  and at this time of greatest need  it’s imperative that we keep this essential supply going.

Currently  there is a huge need to help support the food banks  as so many people are needing additional help  to put food on the table  which is where the idea came from.    Many people leading up to the bank holiday would be planning where they are going to stay overnight camping or in their vans or on holiday  sadly for the VE-Day weekend that can no longer happen. So why dont we celebrate at home ?    So the idea is simple plan your trip based at home  prepare everything you need to go camping  stay overnight on the drive in your van  a tent in your garden  or even in your house (but it must be set up like a camping trip)  or in your caravan.     So how do we raise funds ?   Donate a minimum of £5 in the pot or the amount you would normally have paid for a night camping at your favourite spot during the bank holiday weekend.  If local to Nailsea  the money will go to food bank in Nailsea  if not to the national food bank network  every £ will make a difference.    Its not just about fundraising  so let's have some fun  go to town decorating your place of accommodation  take pictures  upload them to the Facebook page  use your imagination to have an amazing night or more 'away at home!'"

Her funeral is on 15th June. Unfortunately we can't safely have any other mourners  but a few people have asked whether they could make a donation in her memory. A lifelong Labour voter - despite having issues with pretty much every leader! - mum was a huge supporter of food banks. She could never understand how it was possible for such a supposedly wealthy nation to have so many people living in poverty. And the idea that people struggled to feed their children broke her heart. Times are hard  and no one knew that more than my mum. But if you're able to make a contribution  no matter how small  that would be wonderful.

(That's the equivalent of a return overland trip from Guildford to Rome!)    Over 20 members of the Guildford City Swimming Club's Junior County A(&B) teams have come together to combine their shared passion for sport and fitness into a mission to travel 1889km between them over a five week period.    Why 1889km? GCSC was founded in 1889 so we thought it was a fitting target ... and a good challenge at an average of nearly 100km per person (or c. 2.5km a day).     We are all aged between 8-11 years old and will be supported by our families in our endeavour. Starting on May 25th  we will strive to cover the 1889km by any human-powered method we can - be it walking  running  cycling or even swimming if we can get access!     And we'd love to raise funds for the North Guildford Foodbank along the way. Supporting families in our local area who need a little extra help  particularly at this difficult time. It will certainly motivate us to know that we can help others at the same time as challenging ourselves  and to know that you are cheering us along as well.

Every penny raised will go to pay the bills for the next 2-3 months  (the staff manning the not for profit side of things will do so voluntarily) anything above and beyond that amount will go right to buying food for the foodbanks we have worked with in the past  hell  we intend to keep doing our foodbank runs right up until they tell us we need to stay at home ourselves!

My name is Stan Intihar and I am a high school English teacher (and part-time illustrator) here in Edinburgh.    As the situation here (and around the world) worsens  the level of suffering for the patients AND the medical staff trying to help them will become increasingly obvious.    For years I have been involved in the Parent Council Cafes at the schools of both of our children and I have become *moderately* adept at baking scones (insert cheezy smile emoji).    Having 3 asthma sufferers in our family  we have received excellent care from the NHS over the years. Now I plan to show some thanks by setting up a wee ""Scone Stall"" at the exit of the Royal Infirmary at Little France. Upon the presentation of an i.d. badge  the holder will be entitled to a scone (plain  w/ butter  w/butter & jam and gluten-free  if there's enough demand). I will also be asking these staff members what kind of provisions/items would be helpful from a roadside stall. I hope the stall will then expand and develop so that we can show these people that we are behind them.    I will be in need of flour  butter  milk etc.    In addition  I am trying to raise awareness of the situation by designing a number of stickers which will be given away for free. As with the scones  I am only interested in covering my costs. This whole operation is NOT FOR PROFIT.

As well as the worry about getting ill  a lot of people are concerned about how they're going to be able to afford food and bills as they're unable to work due to businesses having to shut down and contracts being cancelled. The Cornish Resistance is a community group and we want to try and raise some money as a hardship fund to help local people in Cornwall if they can't afford to buy food. We're planning on either buying food to donate to the Foodbank or giving them the cash to spend as needed. I know money's tight for a lot of us at the moment but if you can afford a couple of quid  we can pool our resources and help people who are really struggling. Your couple of quid could really help people survive this. Thank you so much for your help  Sarah x"

My Dad  James Yule  recently turned 81 and  being on housebound lockdown for 12 weeks  he decided to do Couch to 5k on the back garden path.    (When my friends heard about Major Tom’s 100 laps for NHS  they thought it was my Dad!) Why?  Someone  BP  from a group he’s on  posted on the group page that - even though James didn’t ask for it - BP wants to sponsor him to complete his challenge  and he offered a donation to a charity of James’s choice!    This gave James his altruistic idea - That if people would like to encourage him to do it  by way of sponsorship  and other people can benefit from what he’s doing  then why would he get in the way of such generosity?!    As food and basic health needs are so fundamental/crucial for the people in the world who are most struggling  he would like the raised monies to go to the local food bank and/or care needs in the community.  St. Andrews Foodbank says:    “Those we serve may have lost their job  had a family split up  be victims of domestic violence  or had benefits delayed or suspended. In desperate times we are able to meet their immediate need for food.”  May we extend our human kindness to them.    How?  So  to make it easier for you to give  if you feel inclined  I’ve set up this page.    I will post updates between now and the end of May  by which he hopes to be able to complete a 5km run  actually running  for the half hour that the programme builds runners up to (and do the remainder by whichever means)!    What makes this a challenge  you might ask?   Doesn’t James do the Parkrun?    Indeed  James has done the Parkrun  before  and consistently since my Mum died  a year ago today  20th April.    He also has angina  a heart condition which makes running that bit more challenging for his body. So he will be doing it gradually/sustainably.    His mind/heart  whilst keeping it fit and agile - as well as desiring to support other people in the community to be well and healthy - is determined. How can you help?    With the challenge food banks face in receiving food from their usual sources (church congregations  supermarkets etc)  you giving money to this cause will ensure food banks are stocked  and people who need the support they offer can still access it.    Thank you for your generous support and donations.    Amitaśūrī  and James    "

I'm proud to have played a small part in helping to organise a few of these fundraising gigs over the last few years. Whilst we cannot arrange any performances in venues at the moment the movement continues virtually and I have arranged an online get together on Friday 29th May to celebrate my birthday. Money raised will go towards the High Street Community Hub foodbank. As well as volunteering there I have been extremely grateful to them for accepting referrals from the Beeston Chilwell Area Mutual Aid Group that I helped to set up. It is no exaggeration to say that people in need would be going hungry without their ongoing efforts of solidarity.     I feel truly blessed to have so many talented friends who have agreed to perform for this fundraiser in collaboration with WSO Nottingham and hopefully raise some much needed funding for the fabulous work being undertaken here in Broxtowe by the High Street Community Hub. Please join me for the evening of Friday 29th May  invite friends and donate if you are able. The live performances and videos will be shared in a private Facebook Group that you need to join via the following link - https://www.facebook.com/groups/2648510692141215/    IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM ACCESSING THE EVENT PLEASE EMAIL OR PHONE - [email redacted] / 07501453628.

We are raising funds to renovate our recently acquired Community Centre which had been abandoned for years to give it a fresh lease of life so it can serve the community. The Living Faith IM church together with its friends and partners worked hard to sacrifice their savings to buy this former youth community centre.    We are spending thousands on converting the building into a community facility to include a youth centre  church  cafe  contact centre  nursery  marriage counselling service and eventually a 650-seat theatre. We have already done renovations worth slightly above £190 000 on the building in order to bring it back up to scratch.     This place will be a hub for our community and much renovations needed are for create capacity for different community groups. We need tiling  carpeting  insulation for heating  installation of an industrial kitchen  we have bought new boilers for the heating system. Other works include  electrical rewiring  security systems  furniture  office equipment  different musical instruments for kids training and video recording and photography training.    Our vision is that this building will be dedicated to helping the youth of Corby      The new cafe in the building will be open to local people especially the elderly and the large sports hall will be available for community groups to use. “We have lots of professionals in the church including doctors  nurses  social workers and accountants to just name a few who are looking to give back to the community.     “We’ll have a not for profit 0-5 nursery which will be affordable for local people. We also aim to complement social service support in the community as when required or requested. We have set aside  contact rooms for use by the Local authority should the need arise for parents to see their children who they don’t live with.”     The huge McDiarmid Hall at the rear has a roof that needs fixing and that on its own is costing £70 000. This hall  after refurbishment will become a 650-seat theatre which will be used as Living Faith’s church as well as a community theatre facility.     We also aim to have a new foodbank housed in the centre.     “It’s costing the church a lot of money but it will be worth it when we see the lives that this place could change.     “Kids can come here and learn different musical instruments and take part in all kinds of activities. It’s about getting kids off the street and giving them something to look forward to. We want to raise a great community here in Corby.”     A Brownies and Guides Group of about 34-64 kids can’t wait for the opening of this centre which is going to be their new home. Exciting times are ahead.    Your financial support to see this dream come true is invaluable. Thanks for being part of bringing change and hope to our community and for Helping to Change Lives and Shaping Destinies.    It will be a Community Centre in the Community for the Community!!!!

We are an essential community service and we will do everything we can to make sure the hungry and vulnerable are fed at this time of crisis. We expect the need to massively increase as the economic crunch hits and we will do everything we can to stay open and meet the demand and to provide a new delivery service for those who are self isolating. We need you to join us to make this a reality. We need your support to buy emergency food provisions and run the operations during this time of crisis. Yes we will need volunteers  yes we will need food  though understand it's hard to buy extra right now. But we definitely need your generous financial donations. I know Bradfordians will rise to the challenge of loving our neighbours as we are such a generous city."

I have been keeping these two jerseys to one day get framed and put them up on my wall. They mean a lot to me as anyone who knows football will know the magnitude of “that” game. During lockdown I made a decision to put them to a good cause and raise money for people who really need it most.

What started as a flu  went into sinusitis and from there a brain infection. It's very rare  very debilitating but could happen to any one of us through no fault of our own.     She's fought so hard and been through so much this year  needing hospital stays weekly and several emergency admissions. Time off work has meant multiple days without pay and the NHS being what is it and her condition being complex  she's had to make weekly train trips over an hour away for her treatment  the train fares incurred leaving her having to choose literally between a potentially fatal build up of infection and fluid on her brain or money for her household bills.     She spends her days mostly crying and it breaks my heart to not be able to wave a magic wand and fix things for her. All her hard work maintaining two jobs to set up a life for her and her daughter has unravelled. For anyone who still believes our government provides an adepquate safety net for situations like these  think again. There is extremely limited help available and she's now in rent arrears  having to use a foodbank and devastated because her daughter is about to begin her first term at High School and is in need of uniform and other items. One job remains open for her  however  she's been replaced in her second job and catching up on rent arrears and other bills will now be doubly difficult once she's on her feet again.     This is is an exceptional lady who's always there for everyone else. This is a lady who has her autistic nephew sleeping on her couch because his parents both decided neither of them wanted him when they split and she couldn't see him homeless in a world where he cannot cope with people he doesn't know.     I'm so very thankful that I have the kind of friends and family who would not walk away if I was in this situation but sadly not all of us have that luxury and this lady is one of them. I just can't bear this any longer  I believe in Karma  this lady has put out so much  she's now in desperate need of a little loving back so I'm reaching out for help. My aim is to raise enough to get her little girl a full uniform and wipe out the rent arrears. Anything and everything donated will help. Thank you x"

The work this school is doing is phenomenal and I feel so privileged to be able to experience this  and I am already looking forward to the next 2 and a half weeks to come!    The object of the project is to teach English to the children in the village  so they have better job prospects than just rice farming  sweatshop work or prostitution. They also run a food bank project  helping some of the poorest families to become self sustainable and giving them food packages that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford.    The last few weeks teaching has been a real eye opener  and one of my highlights so far has been teaching my pre intermediate class all about women’s rights and gender inequality  they are so willing to learn it’s infectious.    I am asking for donations to be able to treat our children on Fun Friday  as lots of them have extremely hard lives and so this fortnightly treat is something they really look forward to! Any remaining money left over from fun Friday will go straight to the food bank project.     Many thanks"

We are so excited about the prospect of bringing this old Grade II listed building back to life! It was originally built in the early 1900’s as a Temperance Hall  since then it has had a plethora of uses  most recent of which left the building in a semi-derelict condition which included severe fire damage.    However  following its acquisition by The Tab Church  fresh ideas began to surface as to how it might be rescued  restored  and adapted to suit the needs for modern usage as Church  Community and Conferencing facility.    The ‘Tab1Milli’ is what will enable this most significant part of the Big Build project vision to become a reality  and the building actually able to be used.    But we can’t pull this off without your generous support because this is the largest financial project The Tab has ever undertaken.    We are therefore asking you to join with us through radical generosity  as together we step out in faith towards hitting the £1Million target by continually bringing our financial gifts together now and over the coming weeks and months.    Once the entire building is renovated  it will enable The Tab to continue and expand its traditional church functions and community initiatives  which are not limited to but currently include:  · Sunday services  · Kids church for children  · Crèche during the Sunday services  · Weekly prayer meetings  · Christian education and classes  · Administrative offices  · Bookshop/resources  · Food Bank – hosting Lewisham Central’s foodbank and distribution point. This is currently offered two-three times a week  staffed by 8-12 volunteers.  · Youth mentoring – support for vulnerable young people in the local community.  · Community action team (Restoration Empowerment and Community Help) – which focuses its support and resources on three vulnerable groups in Lewisham:  The elderly (offering days out and grocery food supplies);  The homeless (offering food clothing to those living on the streets)  and  Women and children escaping from domestic abuse (offering support).    *The Big Build Project includes the overall vision of Tabernacle Global Ministries and therefore maybe used for general purposes...."

On Wednesday 29th April the mighty Thistle were due to play our semi final cup game followed by the final on May 5th. We aimed to be the first team to retain the Newcastle Uni intramural cup. In light of the circumstances  we wanted to help raise money for a fantastic cause. Newcastle Staffs Foodbank provide food for those who cannot afford the essentials in what is a very tough time.     As a squad we'll be covering the 274 miles from Wembley stadium to our post match pub  the Black Bull by Longbenton sports ground in the week between the semi and final. Each player will be covering just over 16 miles from Wednesday to Wednesday. Judging by player fitness during the season  this might be a struggle  especially with a few of the lads taking it easy during quarantine. We'll all chop a freezing pint at the end of our final run just to add to the fun .     We would really appreciate any donation towards our campaign which is going to a brilliant cause. Thank you so much!!"

Cardiac Risk in the Young  NHS Charities Together  and Leeds South and East Foodbank  do some essential work to provide those in need. Please visit the links below or our instagram page for more information on these charities.    In 2012  a member of LBUCC  and our friend Tom Hardman  passed away from an unidentified heart condition. Every year  there is a charity event in memory of Tom to raise money for Cardiac Risk in the Young  however this event was cancelled due to COVID-19.      Instead  as a cricket club  we are going to run/bike/walk to Desert Springs Resort in Spain  from our Headingley Campus in Leeds  using the fitness app Strava to record our distance! This is 4948.52km  meaning the squad will have to cover roughly 700km per day  as we are doing this all inside a week!    Please check out our Instagram (leedsbeckettcc) for more information  and the respected charities websites!"

We have been impressed by the amount of community spirit shown by local residents in setting up a support group and Foodbank.      Although people think that Denham couldn't possibly have a need for a Foodbank  sadly this is not the case so we want to help supplement the physical donations with some money so that much needed items that haven't already been donated by the public can be purchased by the organisers. We'd be grateful for any help you can give and also any song requests. Have a look at this link: Denham Community Support"

We’re going for a double whammy on Fundraising here - 50% of funds will go to help those in more need than us during the virus outbreak. The other 50% will go to help us to keep Sheaf St going while we have no customers Money raised will be spent equally:    - Supporting Leeds South and East foodbank in vital donations  - Creating a swiftly accessible freelancers support fund for creatives  artists and musicians in need due to work cancellations or lack of government support   - Help keep Sheaf St running and enable us to re-purpose staff time to help othersWe have set up this fund in the hope that people who normally would come down to eat  drink and play with us  might be in a position to want to chip in and get involved.

On Friday 31st January  over on our Twitter account @Canned_Aid and using the hashtag #CannedAid  we will be highlighting the incredible work the Trussell do  along with inviting others to share their stories of how charity has changed lives across the UK.     We'll be sharing this crowdfunder up to the evening  then join us online between 6pm - Midnight for a massive push for funds - and hopefully some fun too  linking up people across the Twittersphere and UK.     Lets build on our networks over the past few years  gain back some headline-space with a show of generosity and raise some money for this invaluable nationwide network of foodbanks.     @Canned_Aid   #CannedAid"

Mum was a generous  caring and selfless person who worked tirelessly for social justice. She was devoted to her family and large circle of friends and loved bringing people together. As a Labour councillor for 33 years she dedicated her time to helping and serving others and represented the ward she was born in  and lived in  all her life. Mum was so proud of this role and of her community.  We have set up this page to raise funds in her memory and will share the proceeds equally between three local charities which meant a lot to mum and who are working on the frontline to help disadvantaged people in challenging circumstances. These are; the S2 Foodbank where mum was a regular helper  St Wilfrids Centre which provides support for homeless people and ASSIST Sheffield who help destitute asylum seekers.   Thank you for your support."

We will be running  walking or cycling 5km either in one go  or over a few days  and then nominating five other people to complete the challenge.     Some people in our community are finding things extremely difficult during these most challenging of times and we want to do our bit to support some of our local heroes. We have decided to provide the option of a voluntary donation on completion of the challenge to Market Drayton Foodbank. In the past month since the Covid-19 lockdown  Market Drayton Foodbank has fed 454 adults and children with over 5 tonnes of nutritionally balanced food. We have set ourselves the target of raising £1000 and would love the local community to join us on this journey.     The process is really simple:    Run  cycle  walk 5 km  Share your success   Nominate 5 other people to do the challenge   Optional donation to Market Drayton Foodbank    Thank you.     ******STOP PRESS*****    Mr Barber  Mr Shone and Mr McStay have decided to take on a ‘May Mile Marathon challenge’ in an attempt to help raise further funds for the Market Drayton Foodbank. During the month of May  they will be cycling 1 000KM and to achieve their goal will need to be averaging just over 20 miles for each of the 31 days in the month.     All are fully aware of the importance of food banks during these challenging times and want to do their bit to support a crucial charity in the local community. They will be seeking donations from friends and families and are hoping to raise as much money as possible!"

A Benedictine Priory for nearly five hundred years  and then a parish church serving primarily the poor for just over three hundred years  the Cathedral now serves as the mother church of the Diocese of Swansea. It has a rich heritage that includes a gloriously carved medieval font  an arrow sharpening stone possibly used for the Agincourt campaign  and the regimental colours of the South Wales Borderers  including those from the battles of Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift. It is described in in the Pevsner Architectural Guide for Powys as ""pre-eminently the most splendid and dignified Church in Mid-Wales."" More importantly  Brecon Cathedral is a living community that continues the daily round of prayers  including Choral Evensong  and excellent worship while also serving the needs of the diocese  Brecon  and the world. We are actively involved in supporting the Brecon Foodbank and other charities  and in 2018 started the Convivium initiative to encourage thoughtful engagement between faith  heritage  and the environment. The Cathedral  however  faces serious financial problems. A medieval building is expensive to run and maintain. Even before COVID-19  the Dean and Chapter found it difficult to meet daily expenses. Additionally  the Cathedral roof is in increasingly poor condition and requires in the near future more than a million pounds worth of repairs. Thanks to COVID-19  the financial future of the Cathedral is now even worse thanks to the cancellation of services  concerts and other events.

The individual /individuals have taken tablets that were used for referrals to the fuel bank to enable those in crisis to receive an emergency payment and for a nationwide surveys into foodbank from Edinburgh university. They have taken our main hard drive /pc all are password protected . They have obviously ransacked the office and damaged our filing cabinets. Along side the items we need to replace   they have taken around £200 that was donated over the Christmas period which obviously provides much needed funds for the day to day running of the foodbank. Food was taken too  so we are putting an appeal out for tinned fish  rice pudding  tinned fish   tinned tomatoes and uht milk.   We as a charity can little afford the extra costs incurred to replace the more valuable items and office furniture. Any donations will be greatly received and used to help to wider community .      As stated our original target was £1000 and we have blown away by the generosity of the wider public. I am one of the merry band of volunteers at Oldham Foodbank. We offer assistance to those in crisis with food parcels for 3 days . As we have smashed our target   extra money raised will be used to enhance our current security systems to prevent ourselves from being targeted again . Furthermore the money raised will secure day to day expenses of the Foodbank for the foreseeable future   enabling us to continue to provide to those in need and crisis.   All monies raised is to be transferred to Oldham Foodbank bank account which is run by our Trustees.     Update on 17/5/19     We are in the process of withdrawing funds   The funds will be withdrawn via the manager of the Foodbank and promptly transferred to the Oldham Foodbank account which the Trustees will be able to allocate funds as we require them .   Once again Thank you   a photo showing the transfer and statement will be placed via this page for transparency.     "

The shop supports and celebrates the work of people and artists living with disabilities.     Having lost her job with the closure of the shop since the outbreak of the pandemic  this incredible and inspiring woman  with her own disability  is devoting her time and amazing efforts to help some of the most vulnerable people in the community.    Please  watch the very short video produced by Maggie Padlewska as it captures the essence of Naret and her dedication to helping these families in need. This inspiring video provides a brief insight into the tragic reality for so many families that is unfolding in the Siem Reap province.    There are so many families that need your help more than ever  with your kind and generous support your donations (no matter how much you can afford to give ) means we can help keep their physical and mental health intact throughout this Covid19 Pandemic by helping them survive  whilst offering them a glimmer of hope for the future.     Siem Reap - Cambodia    Siem Reap is a beautiful idyllic tourist town just a stone's throw away from the spectacular Angkor Wat Archeological Park in Cambodia.    ""If you have ever been to Siem Reap  or Cambodia in general  you will know how warm  friendly  kind and compassionate the Khmer people are"".    Since the lockdown began  hardly any tourists are visiting the city  with visitor numbers to the Angkor world heritage site down by 99.5%  only 650 people visited the Temple in the month of April  that's 20 people per day compared to around 5 000 back in January.    This situation has created a major problem in Siem Reap. The average wage in the city for people who worked within or in connection with the tourist industry is around $4 USD per day  that's less than $3.50p for around 10 hours work or 35 pence an hour.    The city is more or less totally deserted with literally no visitors  there is no money being spent  no income….nothing…zero. As you can imagine  if you were only earning $4 a day ""in normal circumstances""  then you can probably understand why many families really don’t have any ability to save money to help themselves get through the times when the going gets tough…really tough.     There are many reports of people hearing children crying themselves to sleep at night through hunger.     Many families are trying to live off the land by foraging for fruit and vegetables  frogs  snakes and Rats etc  but the basic essentials that we all take for granted in the UK such as Rice  Eggs  Cooking Oil  Salt and Sugar are products that thousands of families in Siem Reap simply can no longer afford.     Why the Siem Reap Food Bank?    Having lived and experienced an amazing life in South East Asia for over 18 years  I wanted to contribute in a meaningful way  to help some of the most vulnerable people through the ongoing Covid 19 crisis.    After many discussions with my wonderful friend  Christopher Leonard who is currently living there and witnessing first-hand the stone cold reality of the situation  we decided together to spend considerable time researching and validating food giveaway programs currently operating in Siem Reap.    Christopher  spent quality time with Naret and Rick and we could both see that with more money  international awareness and resources  The Siem Reap Food Bank could reach out to so many more families in desperate need of support.    The Siem Reap Food Bank continues to make a real sustainable difference to people in risk of extreme poverty and hunger.     So I decided to volunteer my time  marketing and fundraising experience to support this incredibly important project and I wanted to share with you why I have chosen this specific Food Bank.    The Siem Reap Food Bank initially launched in April to provide Essential Care Food Packages to people living with disabilities to help them survive the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.     The Siem Reap Food Bank support families headed by or including people with a disability  that have seen their livelihoods disappear  along with the tourists and shops  restaurants  hotels and businesses being shut down.    With the situation continuing to get worse it soon became clear that the Siem Reap Food Bank would not just need to support families with disabilities through this unprecedented time  but any families identified to be in urgent need of an Essential Care Food Package to help them survive.    How Your Kind Donation Helps These Families:    Below is one example of a family the Siem Reap Food Bank is helping every month with a £26 Essential Care Food Package:    Mai Lin  a single mom of 4 children  all under the age of 12  suffered a paralysing stroke about 5 years ago. At the time  she was overwrought with fear that she would no longer be able to take care of her babies.     However  she learned how to make shopping bags from old newspapers and the income generated was sufficient for her to support her family and was even enough to send her children to school. Mai Lin’s income dried up completely with the closure of the Genevieve’s Fair Trade Village shop that sold her products  at the onset of the CoVid19 shutdown.     Along with her first food drop  just before Khmer New Year (April 13th 2020)  came the promise of monthly food drops until she is able to get back to making a living for herself to ensure her family survives.      What's Contained in a Monthly Essential Care Food Package:      We only need 1 000 people from across world to donate as little as as £10 pounds (less than then the price of a few takeout coffees) to succeed in reaching our campaign goal to support 100 families.    Please  help us meet our funding goal by making any donation you can afford.     We know that this is very tough time for many  so if you are unable to donate funds can please help us by sharing this appeal in any way you can via ( social media  friends and family as well as any networks you have connections with) help us create awareness and momentum for this ongoing humanitarian crisis.    On behalf of the families you are helping  thank you for your kindness  you really are making a life changing difference.    Myself and Christopher are volunteering for the Siem Reap Food Bank  I'm in the process of setting up Social Media Campaigns to help create awareness for our gofundme campaign.     GoFundMe does not operate in Cambodia. Therefore  I started this campaign in the UK on their behalf with a Funding Goal to support 100 families that's 400 hundred people we can help and support over the next six months.     We project that at the very earliest tourists may return to visit Angkor Wat  in December 2020.    Be kind - Be Loving - Be Safe    Akhun Charan (Thank you very much in Khmer)    Brian Taylor & Christopher Leonard    Important information about how funds for this campaign are being processed & delivered to the Siem Reap Food Bank    I am a volunteer for The Siem Reap Food Bank  I'll be assisting them with their social media campaigns to increase UK and international awareness. GoFundMe does not operate in Cambodia. Therefore  I started this campaign in the United Kingdom on their behalf to assist them to help an many families as they can.     I solemnly pledge that 100% of all funds raised through this campaign site are automatically transferred to my UK Bank account and then transferred directly into the Siem Reap Food bank ABA bank account in Cambodia.     Our goal is to make sure the Siem Reap Food bank has continuous cash flow to purchase food & other essential items throughout the coming months  therefore monies will be transferred to their bank account on a regular basis.     Donor Fees​ - GoFundMe adds a default Tip of 15% to each donation to help them maintain and improve their free platform. The GoFundme Tip is voluntary and you can change the default tip amount when you donate. The minimum donation amount is £5    ""How to change the default tip amount"" - www.gftv-sr.org/gfmtip.html    We will regularly update our gofundme page so you'll be kept informed on how much you donations are making a significant contribution in sustaining families and saving lifes.

Back at the start of March a local Ottery St Mary resident floated an idea on social media. Her idea was to create a volunteer team to help the “at risk”  elderly  self-isolating and key workers in our community.     From that seed of an idea  in one week over 400 local residents signed up to join and selflessly come to the aid of those around them. Ottery Community Volunteers (OCV) became a reality. Now a unregistered Not for Profit organisation the group has already mobilised to provide vital support to the local community.     What is the purpose of the group?     OCV have three key objectives:     • To establish and sustain for an extended time  a volunteer force capable of supporting our community.     • To minimise the transmission and infection rates of Covid-19 by reducing the footfall within our community and supporting people in isolation.     • To maintain a robust and enduring volunteer operation for as long as is needed  resilient enough to support our community.     What are we actually doing for our community?     The volunteer network is already operational and working in our community. We have divided the volunteer network into priority areas:     Pharmacy Group – collecting and delivering prescriptions for the target people.     Deliveries Team – focused on doing shopping for food & essential supplies  delivered to homes for those self-isolating & vulnerable  reducing the footfall of people in town.     Befriending Group – working alongside the Ottery Help Scheme we offer befriending telephone support for those in need of someone to talk to during their isolation    Foodbank Team – Our volunteers also work with Ottery Foodbank  supporting their essential efforts.    Mental health wellbeing service to our volunteers  run by volunteer healthcare professionals.    Finance team - Using prepaid cards to minimise the use of cash and the risks for transmission of Covid-19  as well as ensuring robust financial accountability.    Why are we fund raising?     Whilst OCV has already started work  up until this point we have relied upon a great deal of good will from volunteers and businesses. In order for us to offer a safe  sustainable  efficient and professional service for our local community we need funding. We recognise that there will be a requirement for active community support for many months to come. We will be using the funds raised to cover a wide range of budgeted costs including:     • Safeguarding training including Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks for volunteers     • Insurance    • Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)     • Volunteer out of pockets expenses including mileage claims     • Stationery & consumables    • Software licences     • Printing and postage    • Staffing & resources    Thank you."

This will be followed by the joggers who will pace their way round the street  before giving way to the runners who will bomb it round to make up the miles.    We would greatly appreciate donations of any size  even if it’s only a £1!

This foodbank is part of The Trussell Trust’s network of 428 foodbanks  working to tackle food poverty and hunger in our local communities  as well as across the UK.

We want to ensure that every baby born in our communities has access to everything they need  and likewise that every child has access to school uniform and other school essentials.    We all want the best for our own children  and it's heart breaking to think that so many children on our doorstep are born into and grow up in poverty. We are trying to make life a bit easier for families who are struggling to make ends meet  and give them and their children a bit of help.     To keep this vital work going we hold regular fundraisers (mainly coffee mornings with the most delicious cakes!) and are very fortunate to receive a lot of support from our community.    We receive referrals from a range of professionals and organisations  such as health visitors  social workers  foodbanks  the Citizens Advice Bureau  Women's Aid and schools. All of these referrals are on behalf of families very much in need across Cumbernauld  Kilsyth and the surrounding area.    We provide a package of new and pre-loved items. We are incredibly fortunate to receive many donations of pre-loved items that can used by another family  but we still have to buy lots of items new. This includes moses basket and cot mattresses (for safety reasons)  socks and pants  and branded school uniform items like blazers.

We urgently need the funds to buy these items for families struggling to get these themselves. We have families who need cots with new mattresses for babies who have outgrown their moses baskets  and blazers for young people who are standing out from their peers because their families can't afford to buy a blazer that fits (we have appealed for pre-loved ones  but no luck yet)."

Personllay I feel ensuring that foodbanks have adequate food to help the most vulnerable in our community is a priority.     There are 5 foodbanks in my local area which last year issued 64.1 tonnes of food  the equivalent of 128 000 packs of 500g bags of pasta. They feed 7 669 clients of which 3 065 are children.    My Challenge:  I am a keen cyclist and due to Covid-19 outbreak my usual social and competitive cycles have been impacted. So to keep motivated I am going to attempt to complete 10 back to back training sessions all from my virtual trainer.    To complete the training sessions I will use a virtual app called Sufferfest   which as the name suggests is a festival of suffering. On a normal day one session is tough so completing 10 back to back will be challenging.    To help me get through the agony and anguish (and saddle sores) I would greatly appreciate any donation you can make towards the foodbank so they can continue their fantastic work in our community.

Homelessness is soaring. Hunger is spreading. We need not only food banks - but foodbank warehouses to feed desperate families. The most vulnerable are being stripped of the benefits they desperately need. The Tories’ austerity is destroying lives.    This is not justice. It’s a Tory choice. It’s not acceptable. It’s not inevitable. And there is an alternative.    The story of the West Midlands is becoming like a ‘tale of two cities’. There are cranes in our skies. But our homeless neighbours are sleeping in the doorways beneath  where someone now dies every fortnight.    Our society feels like it’s ripping apart. Brexit has divided us. In its wake  hate crime and violent crime has surged. Communities no longer feel safe. Islamophobia and homophobia are spiralling while the far right goes on the march.    Meanwhile  our economy is failing a generation. Over half the people in poverty in the West Midlands are in work. Half our wards are in poverty. Youth unemployment is up by a 20% while apprenticeships have collapsed. For thousands of our young people  their possibilities in life are defined by the post-code where they’re born. And looming above the crisis  is a climate that is warming faster than we thought  posing an existential threat to generations to come.    We cannot stand by and watch this happen. We cannot be by-standers. And we cannot let the Tories make it worse. If we don’t take a stand today then ten years from now  we will be more divided than ever in our history. There may be gleaming office blocks and fortunes for some. But inequality will spiral. Entrenched poverty will deepen. And the West Midlands will fall further and further behind London and Manchester.    Find out more here!    "

See below for some examples of calls we have had this week with the foodbanks... -We have urgent requests for food parcels to be delivered and have only 4 parcels left -We might have to close our doors -We usually make dinners but due to social distancing we need to make lunches but have no food to give out - 22 families arrived today and we had no provisions White Label have partnered with Allens Accountants  Grate Fireplaces in Stockport & Silverchip in Manchester to raise the money and we will ensure the most desperate places receive what they need such as basic food and learning books for the children Approx value of a pack is £20  this will cover a family of 4 for 3 days for 3 meals a day.

The initiative is focussed on activities that benefit the community within Blackpool and the surrounding area.    Over the last few weeks  Brothers Helping Hands has been joining in with the community spirit in COVID-19 relief and support by providing lunches for all care home workers in Blackpool and thus far has provided 400 lunches across TWENTY-SIX homes in the area. We have also donated over 1 100 food items such as fresh salads  coleslaws and pastas to various foodbanks in Blackpool & the Fylde to support the vulnerable  homeless and elderly.    The Initiative has also provided ""Thank You"" drops in to all Emergency Service Stations in Blackpool and Fleetwood  with a further drop planned for Lytham over the next few days.    While we are entirely grateful to a number of organisations; namely the Greencore Group for their regular food donations  Fox's Biscuits for their substantial donations and The Gallant Pioneer for free use of their premises to run the operation from  the current levels of expenditure for accompanying food in the ""Lunches for Carers"" packs is unsustainable for the group.    The Lodge is now launching this fundraising effort to help us to continue our work  to complete our lunches for carers during the COVID-19 pandemic and ringfence funds for further potential relief in the town such as to obtain PPE for free distribution and further support to all those on the front line.    All funds will be used only by the Brothers Helping Hands initiative and if required will be ringfenced for future projects lead by the Brothers Helping Hands initiative.    The Lodge is entirely grateful to all donations no matter how small  and greatly appreciates the support of all those who wish this initiative every success for the benefit of the wider community in Blackpool & the Fylde coast."

Asking them how the COVID-19 crisis will affect their businesses. The results were startling  to say the least  with many stating the resultant downturn in trade would mean they could go out of business within one to three months.       With the support shown on this page FADNE have initiated #LocalHeroesNE to stimulate trade and kick-start cashflow to support the sector and save jobs.       #LocalHeroesNE is an online food market that promotes  sells and delivers high-quality local North East food and drink to homes and people across our region. The virtual market will launch in early May and we will post a link to the platform when live.      Supporters will be able to choose from a range of ‘Discovery Boxes’ and fantastic products from the best North East suppliers. The purchase of every box includes a 10% 'community fund' that will be used to support producers and those working with the vulnerable and socially isolated. The funds raised from the purchase of boxes and this ‘go fund me’ campaign will benefit those that need it most. We’re developing the fund at the moment alongside launching this campaign - more information on the administration of this fund will be available soon. Whilst we’re working on it  we will be committing the first £1000 raised to helping local people in crisis via the Newcastle West End Foodbank.       This initiative is currently completely self-funded and is being built from the grassroots up with the help a number companies  organisations and individuals with experience in storage  logistics  distribution  transport and digital technology who are all eager to see it succeed. Please help us support local businesses and communities - buy a discovery box  support local  tell your friends. Thank you for your kindness and your commitment to our incredible North East food and drink producers and businesses.

With the current situation we find ourselves in due to Covid-19  I have been inspired by the things we have seen our communities doing for each other. Within those communities  you have individuals who may shop  cook or even cut grass for people at risk or our key workers  but then you have pillars of the community such as the Greyfriars that do so much more. Not only do they help individuals with foodbanks as an example  but they are an important part of the Irish heritage and support the community in more ways than some realize. The Greyfriars has been the host to many an amazing night with some great memories with our friends and family. The team are like family to us all  and I know my late mum thought the world of that place and the people that run and drink there  and she always had a great judge of character. If my mum was here now  she would be doing anything she could to help the club and keep it open  she had such great time for that place and the people involved behind the scenes (obvious soft spot for Paul ) With the club being so important to our community  I want to help them as much as possible to allow them to continue to offer what they do for us all. So  that being said  from Monday 18th I am going to challenge myself to run 100km in 30 calendar days to raise as much money as we possibly can for the Greyfriars. That’s 25km a week give or take… as I write this  i am slightly worried for myself. I am just under 20stone and nearly 40 years of age… very much out of shape  so this is going to be a huge challenge for me. I know my mum would be supporting this and be proud of the fact we are pulling together  so when I am hurting (and it will hurt)  this will give me the inspiration I need. Please make it worthwhile by chucking a few quid to this amazing cause. I will post each run on face book  update with photos/videos and keep track of the miles. Your donations will spur me on  lets do this! Thanks for reading  John x"

Despite lockdown  supplies and healthcare resources are running low especially for those who need them barring recreational use. Thus  we have started raising money for masks and gloves and are buying them from multiple sellers and are distributing them to the hospitals  care homes and those in need. We will be self distributing in the appropriate sense respecting lockdown rules. There are no profits to be made  as well as our own money all donations will be used to pay for those healthcare resources (gloves & masks) to form healthcare packages to those in need. We will also be making food packages for foodbanks and those in need. In full transparency  your money will be in safe hands  through the GofundMePage the withdrawn funds will be placed in an individual bank account rather than a collective foundation. The donations will be used directly as funds for healthcare resources to be given to the places mentioned previously. Inshallah. It is all non profit  every little can help whether it be a small donation or contributing supplies. Stay home and stay safe. Thank you/Jazakallahkairun In memory of Nasir Ahmed.

We have secured approx. £75k from Sport England  £25k from The Steve Morgan Foundation and are looking at other ways to raise money to make this project happen. We may need an additional £20k towards the costs of the building but can't approach either funder for more. We have put in over 18 months worth of bid writing  meetings  reports  council applications  lease issues  blood  sweat and tears  to get us to where we are now. We have worked too hard to fall at this final hurdle. The site is used by 2 organisations. The Inclusion Network CIC provide free youth club activities for local young people  free school holiday youth provision  youth projects  community projects  a foodbank session once a week and European project opportunities for y.p's. They are funded by Children In Need  Henry Smith Foundation and several other smaller funders. This is for 48 weeks of the year. I am Colin Murray  one of the directors of this community interest company  and who is asking for your financial support and backing.  Northfield Football Association run approx. 26 junior football teams from ages 5/6 up to 14/15. They have been set up as a charity since the mid 1990's and have engaged and worked with thousands of young people. It is entirely volunteer led and they have an unbelievable group of people that help run it. Between the 2 organisations we provide approx. 18 000 attendances by young people per year (approx. 25 000 if you count the parents that bring them). Now this is the amazing thing and is the reason why I believe we deserve your support...…..we do all of this work from a small converted football changing room/building!!!!!!!!!!!  We have converted the football changing rooms into a small community centre which comprises of a small meeting/group room  small IT room  a small (falling apart) kitchen  a few toilets and a couple of other storage type rooms. We have the basics like light  electricity  gas etc  but we have no central heating  21st century facilities or no real space to engage even more of the community we care about. That's where you come in. We have been working with the 2 nationally recognised funders mentioned at the start of this story (Sport England and The Steve Morgan Foundation) and have secured 100k of their funding towards this project but we are still falling short of the possible build costs of £120k+. We are hoping this crowdfunding page gets us halfway there!! We are also hoping that all of the people who know us as organisations  and as professionals  can see how close we are to securing a centre that will be fit for purpose  but also know how much work and effort we put into this centre and this community.    Will you please support us and allow us to gain a centre that will still be here in another 25/30 years time serving the local (and further afield) children  young people and adults of our community."

The food bank is available to all local residents  regardless of age.     During the current Covid-19 pandemic  some food banks have closed and others are operating at reduced capacity. Many elderly and vulnerable residents are unable to rely upon their usual channels of support and many in the community have been affected financially due to the crisis and are unable to meet their basic daily needs. The Square Mile Food Bank is therefore a critical resource to ensure that those most in need can be provided with urgent  nutritious food supplies.    The food bank is volunteer led and relies solely on donations from members of the community  companies and other grant giving bodies. Any donation  large or small  will make a huge difference to ensure that we are able to reach as many people as need the service.

Part two: we will be going into Highwoods Community Centre where we will be working in Squirrels Pre School to freshen it up and make it more appealing to the eye both inside and out. This will include: painting the sheds  clearing between the sheds  clearing weeds  a general tidy up and if we raise enough we will replace the old bamboo fencing.

With more than 50 households now on our delivery list  we are in constant need of food donations. Many kind people  organisations and businesses have supported us  but to make sure we are able to continue delivering to an ever-increasing amount of households in our area  we are now seeking more support to be able to buy in food and items we desperately need but not always get through donations.

NC500 is a route in the Scottish Highlands covering the West and East Coast. I will be managing the equivalent by cycling a certain distance per day throughout Caithness. I will be using the app “MapMyRun” (can change to cycling) to measure the distance each day up until 516 miles is complete! The proceeds will go towards our local food bank of which is busier than ever during this pandemic (big thank you to Pat & Grant Ramsay  and their volunteers). These guys help people with emergency food supplies and aid them to getting back on their feet - and I’m sure at a time like this there will be a fewof us struggling! Any other monies raised I will put towards the retail services in Wick and small businesses - as they are the ones keeping their doors open allowing us to get our basic needs. Our NHS and carers are all doing a fantastic job  as are the retail and community members  etc etc! So a huge thank you to every key worker in Caithness. "

We would like to ask you to join us in helping to provide essential food parcels for vulnerable families in Medellin.     Many families are facing serious hardship and do not have the basic necessities due to the current government enforced lockdown.     People are struggling to buy food and have no income.     The current measures here mean that for many people it is impossible to work at the moment. Here there is not a support system in place to help people who cannot work or feed their families  or buy medicine.     We are deeply concerned for the welfare of the families that we work with  the children that we teach English to and the mothers that we spend Wednesday afternoons with in our women’s programme – as well as many other families that at the moment are in a really desperate position.     The lockdown has already lasted a month and the future is uncertain.     Huellas (Footprints)  the foundation we volunteer with are receiving donations and working with the city’s foodbank to deliver food parcels directly those most in need. Huellas have been operating for 10+ years and know the needs of the local area and families (a number of the volunteers live in the area too). They are so dedicated and the team’s response to the crisis has been amazing – finding innovative ways to educate the community to stop the spread of Covid-19 and providing food parcels.     Please help them continue supporting some of the most vulnerable families in the city and we can make sure that the children and mothers we work with  and the wider community  have food. If you have had the chance to visit Colombia  or know Colombians  you will know what warm  generous and kind-hearted people they are  and right now they really need some support.     We know that this is an incredibly difficult and uncertain time for everybody and that lots of people are already supporting charities that they care about. We are so lucky in the UK to have the NHS and a social welfare system that we can use. Many of these families have nothing and for most of us  the difficulties they are facing are unimaginable. You could really make a difference.     All of the money collected goes directly to the foundation who support the families directly by providing basic food supplies. As little as £5 could really help.     Please do donate if you can... and check out our instagram page to see what we have been up to!     https://www.instagram.com/somosfundacionhuellas/"

Foodbanks  in particular  are being hit very hard during these days of panic buying so I'm looking to raise funds for both the Sunderland East End & Newcastle West End Foodbanks. The story about the Egg  it had been £550 and was on display in Fenwicks Newcastle  made by Charbonnel et Walker  one of Britain’s first and finest chocolatiers. It stands at about 500mm tall and has a circumference of about 1m. It's a mountain of some of the best chocolate in the world. Due to the Covid-19 virus  Fenwicks (a Newcastle institution) had announced it was closing down during this period for the safety of both its staff and customers  as a consequence it was also reducing all of its easter products. So how do I have it and what's the plan?     Having literally called in for something for my dinner that evening  then wondering why the food hall was so busy? I noticed in both the chaos and panic buying the easter products at discounted prices.     I also noticed this mother of all Easter Eggs Big Bertha (one of the biggest Easter Eggs in the Country) and its discounted price. Bargain  but there was no way I could eat it all but could there be a way that we could feed many more from this opportunity and some good news could come from both of these situations... I then cracked open a plan. Make a donation  I have set a minimum donation of £1 but you can donate whatever amount you like. You can make multiple donations to increase your chances or just be a kind person and make one. A name will be drawn at random by BBC Radio Newcastle either on the day Fenwicks reopens it doors or by the 8th April at the latest  in time for it to be delivered for Easter.     Let's make this a good news story for everyone as sharing is the new caring. Thanks for your support   Ian "

I’m raising money for my local food bank  ‘Eat or Heat’ who run an invaluable service for our community’s most vulnerable residents. They also host community events to bring people together. I don’t want to be political but austerity has affected many of us and around 4 million children now live in poverty. Universal Credit is being rolled out in Waltham Forest this year leading to an inevitable rise in food bank use.Please donate so that the food bank can buy items that aren’t donated regularly - especially sanitary items as well as extending shelf space.Also  if you donate you can set me a challenge and I’ll try do it - please be nice!

Our lives have changed radically with COVID-19 and we have also realised that even if we are still young  we can try to help those in need. It all started with a math challenge we had to solve. If we managed to solve it in a day  we would receive 100 pounds from friends of our parents! Enough to buy our dream dog! We sat down a whole morning and solved it. However  we both decided that other people need this money more than us in these difficult times. Especially food banks all over our country. So this is how it all began  we have now decided to take on as many challenges as possible and donate the money raised to The Trussel Trust. We hope that you will help us by suggesting challenges and donating money along the way. We are ready to tackle anything  sports  artistic  academic  culinary  linguistic  we will give it our best!

A group of us affected students (and generous others) have made the DS2020 Simulator  a virtual recreation of our show that never happened  in its intended location of Glasgow’s Stow College.

No Judgement. Nobody Should be Hungry.      The Deli Group have launched our Christmas Campaign - www.nobodyshouldbehungry.co.uk - offering FREE Christmas Dinners for those in need across the St Helens and Newton-Le-Willows areas.     We're funding this ourselves as much as we are able to  working in conjunction with many of our key suppliers  however lots of incredibly kind and generous customers  friends and neighbours have asked about contributing so that we can help even more people.    We've always been clear that we're not a charity  and we were reluctant to become involved with handling donations as it's so easy for good intentions to be misconstrued or misinterpreted where money is concerned. Having said that  we realise that there is only so much we can do with our own limited resources and the goodwill of our suppliers  so having taken some advice we've set up this GoFundMe page as a means to transparently collect any contributions which you wonderful people may like to make towards this initiative.    To keep things as transparent and open as possible  we've also opened an entirely separate  ring fenced bank account - and we will regularly share details of any contributions and expenditure both here and via our Dentons Deli and Newton Deli social media accounts.    As we've no idea what the cost of providing these meals will be until all bookings are confirmed  it's difficult to set a budget or to stop accepting contributions once the cost has been met  therefore again to keep things open and to ensure that nobody benefits unfairly from the generosity of others  we've decided to donate any surplus to St Helens Foodbank  and again we will share details of this publicly.    Thank you all so very much for your help and support. By working together  we can make such a difference to the lives of those locally who may otherwise be hungry this Christmas.           Please see below details of the campaign -     For many years we’ve not sent Christmas cards or gifts outside of our immediate family  instead giving a donation either of money or our time to charity  to help those in need.    This year  we’ve decided to try to do our bit in ensuring that nobody living locally has to go hungry. Whatever the reasons  and putting politics and judgement aside  far too many people - both adults and children - are going without the food they need to live  which is totally unacceptable when so many have far more than they need. We may not have a lot ourselves  but what little we have we’d like to share to hopefully make things a little easier for others.    So  The Deli Group are pleased to announce the launch of our “Nobody Should Be Hungry” campaign - www.nobodyshouldbehungry.co.uk    If you’re finding things a struggle  or you know somebody who is  we’d like to invite you to book a FREE Christmas Dinner  which will be freshly prepared and delivered on Monday 23rd December between 4pm and 8pm. All meals will be delivered hot and ready to eat  or can be safely kept and re-heated on Christmas Day.    Book online now at www.nobodyshouldbehungry.co.uk - we’re going to work with our suppliers to provide as many meals as we can  but places will be limited both by availability and the time it will take to prepare and deliver so many meals  therefore please book early to avoid disappointment.    Both adult and child sized portions are available  along with the option to collect from our Newton Deli shop or for the meals to be delivered to you at home.    No Questions  No Judgement. NOBODY should EVER be hungry.    Love from Viv  Marc and all of the Deli Group team. x x"

I'm Jen  a comic book creator based in Leeds!      Over the last 2 years  I've done a couple of twitch streams to raise money for my local Trussell Trust foodbank - You can get more information about their important work and see my two previous campaigns here:    10 Hour Stream for the Foodbank - 2018  10 Hour Stream for my local Foodbank 2017    Sadly  as the pressure on the foodbanks continue to mount here in the UK  I am once again back to do silly things on the internet for 10 hours to raise money for charity -     Only THIS year  there's a bit of a twist!  We have a new family member! Meet Petie:      Petie was taken in by the amazing people over at Dogs Trust Leeds after he had been repeatedly attacked in his previous home. He is a senior dog who just needed a stable and safe retirement home  and we were more than happy to help!    Going through the process of adopting Petie really opened my eyes to the exceptional work that goes on behind the scenes at Dogs Trust. I decided pretty quickly that I wanted to give back to them somehow in the near future.    So this 10 hour art stream will be a bit different than my previous two!    I will need to take a break to go for a walk with Petie  so the stream will briefly go offline for that  but I'll make up for that time by streaming a bit later!

There are only a handful of surgeons in the world who specialise in this field  with the only one in Europe based in Barcelona. This surgeon has diagnosed me remotely through taking a detailed clinical history and studying images from an upright MRI. Below  there is more information about what these conditions are and what they mean for me. The next step for me would be to follow the strong recommendations of the neurosurgeon and meet with him for a series of tests alongside a face-to-face consultation to determine the extent of the issue and how necessary/beneficial surgery would be. These tests are as follows: Cineradiology - Similar to a digital motion x-ray  this imaging is used to confirm the extent of instability in the spine. It is simply an x-ray in motion in flexion and extension of the spine. This is perhaps the most important test as the neurosurgeon suspects from my upright MRI that I have subaxial instability from C2-C4. Knowing the extent of my subaxial instability is important as it directly impacts treatment options  and this test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. MRV - The MRV is a angio/venogram (with contrast) of the brain and neck looking for possible stenosis or compression of any of the veins or arteries (especially the jugular veins). This is important as vascular stenosis can be a comorbidity or consequence of CCI and AAI  which I have been diagnosed with. If I have any compression  it may be able to be treated by a specialist here in the UK  which could alleviate symptoms - so it is important to know if I have it. Ophthalmologic exam - Similarly  the ophthalmologic evaluation checks for signs of papilledema or damage to the optical nerve from intracranial hypertension. Again  intracranial hypertension can be treated in the UK so this knowledge would be immensely useful for tackling my health moving forward. The results of these tests  and my original imaging and questionnaires would then be discussed in a face-to-face appointment. So far  I have been diagnosed by the neurosurgeon solely on the measurements of my MRI combined with my clinical history. A face-to-face appointment is important to confirm these diagnoses  discuss surgery and whether it is necessary  and ask any questions I might have. To this end  I am planning a trip to Barcelona in April and I have outlined a breakdown of the costs of the trip below: Cineradiology - €350 MRV - €700 Ophthalmologic exam - €220 Consultation - € 250 Total costs of tests and appointment - €1520  or approximately £1300. Additionally  we are also asking to partially crowdfund some of the costs of accommodation. The final accommodation isn’t booked yet but the cost is approximately £200 a night  with four nights total. Total costs of accommodation = £800 This means that we are asking for £2100 in total  with myself and my family paying for the remainder  including flights  the rest of the accommodation  transport  travel insurance  food  etc. Background information In 2011 I developed Myalgic Encephalomyelitis  a multi-systemic but primarily neuro-immune disease which has absolutely devastated my life. My health has declined a lot over the years; I had to give up schooling  became a wheelchair user in 2015  am unable to work  and now find myself bedbound/housebound a lot of the time. The symptoms are numerous and debilitating. I am in severe pain daily  my cognition is profoundly impacted  my muscles are significantly weakened  and my gastro-intestinal system is affected. I have developed co-morbid conditions  including a yet to be diagnosed heart condition. This is just a fraction of what I face. The crowdfunding campaign I did in 2015 to get my wheelchair absolutely changed my life for the better  and I would argue saved my life  given that I haven’t attempted suicide since I’ve had my wheelchair. I was able to take up archery  start several voluntary jobs which contribute a lot to society  become a lot more independent on a daily basis  travel the world  and save myself a lot of pain and speed of decline. However  my condition has still deteriorated  albeit a lot slower than it would have without my lifesaving wheelchair. For many years I had resigned myself to the fact that my disease is incurable  and in my case  progressive. However  in 2019 it progressed to be the worst it’s ever been and I lost a large amount of the little functionality I had left. This has left me in a dire place mentally  and at high risk of suicide. I started to do a lot more research into potential treatments and causes  most of which I had given up on years ago because of the prohibitive costs. I found that a small but growing subset of ME patients are finding that they have structural issues that cause symptoms similar to or the same as their ME symptoms. In October 2019 I found out that I am part of that subset  having both CCI and AAI as well as suspected subaxial instability. CCI in its most basic sense means that my head isn’t being properly supported by my neck  causing brainstem irritation and possible compression. As the brainstem is a vital component of a lot of bodily functions  this causes a whole host of symptoms  including tachycardia  heat intolerance  polydipsia  chronic fatigue  neck pain  facial pain  muscle weakness  dizziness and vertigo  and many others. AAI means that when I turn my head left or right  two of the uppermost vertebrae in my spine  the atlas and axis  are subluxing  which means a partial dislocation. As you can imagine  this causes many symptoms too. Whether the CCI is a cause or effect of my ME is unknown. It could be that the CCI is causing all of my ME symptoms  as in the case of Jen Brea and Jeffrey Wood (see below)  or it could be that the inflammation and tissue degradation that is part of my ME has caused the structural issues I am now facing due to my ligaments weakening. However  either way it needs to be addressed  and treating it could potentially improve some of my symptoms and give me more of a life. In order to treat it  we first need to know the extent of the problem  hence the testing. My life as is stands feels very unliveable. I am currently unable to partake in most of my voluntary jobs. I have had to give up archery  which was the sport I took up after having to give up cheerleading. I am slowly but surely losing everything that makes my life feel worthwhile. If I can regain at least some of my health  even to the level I was three years ago (still disabled)  that would be lifechanging  and saving. I am doing everything I can to make this happen  including private treatment for my ME in the UK. The CCI testing is a large and crucial part of the jigsaw. Unfortunately  none of this is available on the NHS. While the NICE guidelines are still under review  they currently promote CBT and GET as ‘treatments’ for ME  despite every ME expert in the world explicitly stating that this is harmful. I credit GET for the decline in my health that led to me becoming a wheelchair user. CBT is not an appropriate treatment for a neurological disease  though psychological support is crucial in dealing with such a devastating illness. I am receiving this mental health support on the NHS which I am immensely thankful for. Any treatment to address the underlying disease process and its effects (perhaps including the CCI) has to be done privately. I have briefly outlined below why I need help with this. If you would like to read more about CCI  please follow the links below: https://www.me-pedia.org/wiki/Craniocervical_instabilityhttps://centenoschultz.com/craniocervical-instability/https://medium.com/@jenbrea/health-update-3-my-me-is-in-remission-dd575e650f71 https://www.mechanicalbasis.org/ Why I need to crowdfund Due to the severity of my conditions I am unable to work and therefore my only income is disability benefits. A significant chunk of this contributes to my social care package which I use to employ a PA  and further money goes on monthly medical costs. So far I have been funding these investigations through money left to me by my Grandfather when he died  but this money is dwindling rapidly as I have spent a substantial amount of money on the Upright MRI and consultations alone. I need the rest for treatments in the UK  the cost of which is enormous. How your donation will help Any amount donated will help me get the testing I need to determine the extent of my CCI and AAI  which is the first step before I can undertake any treatments for it. Future treatments (which I will likely also have to crowdfund for) could give me my life back. What does that look like? It means me no longer being intensely suicidal every day. It means me being able to go back to my roles as a voluntary support worker for survivors of sexual violence; supporting some of the most vulnerable members of society at a local foodbank; and continuing my work as a local parish councillor. It also means me being able to get more involved with the activism that I am passionate about  and continue hobbies and passions that make my life feel enjoyable. If I am lucky enough to raise more than the amount I am aiming for initially  I will put this towards the cost of treatments  both for the CCI and ME  as these cost a significant amount of money and I am rapidly running out of resources  but desperately need the treatment."

Local families in need would receive a hot meal  activities for the children and support. We've also been able to provide each family with a 'pamper pack' of essentials such as shampoo  soap  toothpaste and suncream.     Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic we're unfortunately not able to run the club this summer. But the families need us more than ever and we still aim to provide families who would have attended with toiletries and other essentials.    We are hoping to provide 35+ packs  which cost approx £12-15 each. Any donations  small or large will help us to do this. The donations will be ringfenced by the foodbank so we can buy what's needed for families who would have been referred to us this summer.     Thank you in advance for anything you can give. It really will make a difference.     More information about Bromley Borough Foodbank: Provide food and other essentials to people who are in desperate need and have obtained a legitimate voucher."

(Meet the Um family  the first two candidates  Wataia standing in the middle in white  and Srey Vit standing next to me in black on the right)    My name is Jobi. I have been working in rural Cambodia since March 2017  first as a volunteer teaching English at a charity based in Takeo province  then as it General Manager  which included running it's education and community outreach through its Foodbank Project and other initiatives.     Now let me tell you about the Um family. They are very poor. Wataia is the young man in the white shirt and is 21. He had to start school late as the family couldn't afford to send him when he was younger. He is extremely humble and works tirelessly to provide for his family.    The young woman in black is Srey Vit  his younger sister who is 19. She managed to start school at the right age and that's why they have both finished high school at the same time  despite the 2 year age difference. She is very sweet  cares deeply for her parents  working very hard juggling studying  working on their farm and looking after their mother.    Both of them spend most of their free time helping make ends meet at the family home. They both love to study though and have a good record at school. Wataia dreams of working in a bank and Srey Vit would love to be an accountant as they are both very good at maths. They want nothing more than to go to university so they can get better jobs and help their family.    Their mother had stop working recently due to illness. She used to sell food and snacks before but even then the family struggled. Now the family is reliant upon the father  who is a labourer  but work is extremely sporadic and the auntie selling homegrown vegetable for $125 a month. At best  they make $275 a month. This is for a family of 5. Their is nothing left after paying expenses  especially as the mother is sick and needs lots of medical care.    Currently there is no way for them to attain their dream of going to uni. Their courses cost $600 each a year over 3 years. For a family of 5 that can barely get by $3300  $1200 a year plus all the other costs such as books and supplies is impossible to afford.     One thing that is striking is the high cost of higher education  with no government grant or loan system in place. It is a significant barrier to entry  and only middle class families can easily afford it; the poorer families have no way to access even if the student is very bright as only a tiny number can obtain scholarships.    Let me break it down:  University fees range from $450 to $650 per year depending on the course at the local university in Takeo. The costs to study at more prestigious university in Phnom are astronomically higher.     Most lower level salaries range from $80 to $200 a month. This includes working at one of the many textile factories  real 'sweatshops'  which are terribly regulated and unsafe. Often families are little more than subsistence farmers making little more than the bare minimum to survive  making far less money than those on salaries and their income is very unpredictable thanks to the increasingly varied weather during growing season thanks to Climate Change.    Virtually all higher paid jobs that are legal require a university degree as standard. If families cannot afford to have their kids go to university  the cycle of poverty for them is almost unbreakable in rural areas  even if the kids are extremely talented.     $1800 for a three year course is simply too high for the poorest to afford. They will likely earn enough to barely survive for the rest of their lives. However this is not the case  if their is outside intervention. This is what I'm asking you to be apart of. This fund will start providing talented but poor young women and men a means to go to university  break the cycle of poverty and improve the quality of life for themselves  their families and their communities. We intend to pay for their university fees either in full or partly depending on how much we raise.    We will pay the fees directly to the university ourselves. Each candidate will be vetted thoroughly and only chosen if they are deemed suitable. Everything will be invoiced and accounted for.    For Wataia and Srey Vit  if we can afford to pay at least half of their uni fees per semester of $600  they may have a shot at going. Even then they will have to make tough sacrifices. If we can raise enough to pay in full  it will be far easier for them  though still with many difficulties. Anything extra will go towards school supplies for them; textbooks are very expensive and a laptop to share would be necessary at some point for their course. Anything raised more than our target will go towards the next candidate for this fund.    This is one of the best ways to really change two lives in an incredibly positive way.     Thank you for taking the time to read this. I know it is a long read but I wanted to be as clear as possible. We have about a month to raise the funds.    Anything you could give would be greatly appreciated. Thank you and please feel free to get in touch.    Jobi"

This means that many who are over 70  who have underlying health conditions and who are pregnant will find it difficult to leave the house to buy essential supplies. Some of these people will not have the family and friend  or financial support needed to get through this crisis.    The supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and foodbanks up and down the country are running out of food.    In order to make sure that nobody goes without the essential items  the Wednesbury Coronavirus Support Group is fundraising to buy essential supplies in order to be able to get emergency food and hygiene parcels to people in Wednesbury who are in need.

Given the current COVID-19 outbreak we are offering extra support to our clients such as helping collect shopping and prescriptions  helping taking care of animals or simply being there as friendly face to chat. Some of these things will cost a little so we have set up a fund to help support ourselves and our clients during this time. Donations will be used to buy extra food stocks since we are running very low  to help our volunteers with any fuel costs and generally to help the day to day running of the food bank during this uncertain time.

We'll be walking the whole of the ward of Shipley  pounding those streets  alleys and snickets and getting that shoe-leather warmed up and ready so please donate what you can and help us raise some well needed funds for the forthcoming fight.

The Marie Emmanuel Foundation based in London and Abidjan is setting up a ""FoodBank"". A food bank that will be formed through a chain of solidarity that you and we will be part of  in order to provide food support to the poor families of Abidjan (people living day by day).    It is important that the strong one support the weak one because one will carry the other ...    Don't expect the government to do our part because it matters a lot. The survival of our Abidjan community depends on it.    A site has already been selected for the storage and distribution of food.    A kilo of rice  or a packet of spaghetti  or even a can of sardines  will be enough to give hope to a family. WITH ONLY £ 1 we can help at least one family in need.    It's the union that makes strength     Let us know how to anticipate. As it is said so well  the provident never regretted (the prudent man sees evil from afar).

But then Coronavirus happened :( Obviously there are now way more important things happening than my birthday - vulnerable people are at risk from the virus  workers are giving every hour they have to help people live and function  and people are losing their jobs due to the economic crisis. Thankfully due to Facebook/Video chat  a lovely social circle and the bottle of wine I have stashed in the cupboard - I can still get dressed up  get drunk  get online to see my friends and have a wee party in my flat to myself. But I thought as people are no longer spending money on buses/trains/taxis we could all donate a few quid to a good cause. With funds raised from this page I'll be buying vouchers/products/tickets from local businesses that would appreciate our support now more than ever. If you donate I'll pop your name in a hat then I'll livestream the draw on Saturday night - if you've made a donation then you could snap up one of the fabbo prizes on offer! So  support your local business + socialise online with your pals + watch a ridiculous drunken live stream of me = no brainer!    Hoping to use some of the donations to buy some much needed products for a foodbank - so if you can afford to give more then please do!    Please donate even the cost of a return bus journey  coffee or pint at the pub and let's keep our local business going :)    Feast your eyes on the prizes below:    £20 to spend on a perfect plant or blooming bouquet of flowers from Pollination.

I’ve seen that people are donating to raise £500 000 to make Big Ben ‘bong’ at 11pm on 31st January. Apparently that is an important time for a good bonging. Thinking about it  I’m prepared to bong at this time for way less money. In fact I’d probably do it for free.    Since people are willing to pay for a big bong though  I figured I might as well take advantage of that and raise some moneyfor a good cause. I’ll probably look a bit silly but even if I raise £50 for it  then it’ll have been worth it! NOTE: This is not political in any way  just a daft way to raise money for a cause I really care about.   The Trussell Trust do fantastic work trying to combat hunger in the UK  including running a pretty hefty network of food banks.

I can in some small way understand the fear and worry people would face without this resource. As someone often in the church building  I see first-hand people (often not the ones we 'picture' in our minds)  but everyday hard-working families  people like us  who just need a helping hand. SO I went to Tesco to buy some food for us hoping to donate some too. But there was no food to give so I thought I could give my donation in financial terms - thus allowing Yeovil Christian Support Trust to top up their own surplus and use my gift as they require. Perhaps you would consider doing the same. Could you spare a fiver to help top up the food bank and other groups the Lords larder helps. The church link is https://yeovilcommunitychurch.co.uk and the charity is www.ycstyeovil.org.uk and ALL donations will go directly to them... helping provide food parcels and support all manner of clients in OUR town.   Because who knows in this day and age  when we may need it ourselves. Thank You. I've set the target but would love to see that broken - plus I'm happy to accept silly challenges for money!!

Let rally together and help those that need it. Nobody should have to starve and be alone in this awful time.    Many thanks in advance for any support you may give."

Around 7 years ago we launched a foodbank on the back of hearing about children going to school with only biscuits in their lunchboxes. We started collecting for existing foodbanks and eventually created our own mobile foodbank where we were able to deliver food directly to those in need.    We purchased a Van to allow us to deliver the parcels and also to go to various supermarkets and collection points to collect the food. We have been able to support thousands of local people as a result and this has offshooted into other projects such as healthy eating courses  money management  cooking on a budget etc and signposting the people we support.    As we have grown  more and more volunteers have joined the team and we have a wide range of referral agencies including local schools  the police  womens refuges  mental health teams  social workers  homeless centres  crisis support teams and so on.

After facing closure and threat to their current premises earlier this year  they are currently in a precarious situation  and would benefit from the stability of additional donations.

According to the centre  hope is not lost  but more needs to be done: ""A volunteer team are in the process of implementing a short-term fundraising strategy to make sure Salford Foodbank can remain open beyond March 2020  and work is underway to develop a longer-term strategy in the new year.""

She had just made a pudding with the last cup of cornmeal  the last of the batch she got from Doting Foundation a few weeks ago. As she watched her children eat  three-year-old dropped her spoon in the bowl and started scratching. She had been fighting particularly stubborn eczema for months and with not enough money to feed not to talk of buying the medicine and creams she needs  will go on fighting is for a while.     Turayo is a young widow. The loss of her husband to Tuberculosis two years ago left her three girls and a boy fatherless  the family without a source of living and her an ill-equipped single parent. The only job she was able to get  a cleaning job that paid her a quarter of minimum wage for thirty days of work barely feeds her family for a week.

The Medicine shall be administered by our trained medical personnel while we would deliver health talks and offer our shoulder for grieving.

I was told never to expect too much from myself. But my mother imparted me with a very important life lesson that I now follow to this day and that is  ""In order to be a leader you must first learn to love and lead yourself.""    I know now  that time has come  for me now and this is my announcement to the rest of the world  that I'm ready to lead this world into a new era of posperity and unity. A world where we are connected through our pride and success of how far we've come together  instead of a world hindered by our differences.    WHY I NEED YOUR HELP ?    I want to use my experience   talents and skillsets to empower young and old black people from across the world through global development and green technology.    I will help fulfil and unkept legacy and help the people of Africa and the Carribean  to realise the potential within them.    HOW WOULD I ACCOMPLISH THIS ?    Providing a continental high class quality education system that is free for all of its citizens.    Utilise Green technology to begin to address the solutions that can be made for ensuring a future for all the world and its inhabitants.    Providing free electricity and access to the internet for all nations in Africa and the Carribbean.    A continent united under one constitution.    A country where our resources and talents are not exploited and abused by corporations that do not hold the interests of the people or its land.    A nation where poverty  war and social-economic exploitation is a thing of the past.    A continental foodbank that can address hunger and be used in cases of national disaster and emergency.    A continent that supports the art of learning  intergrity and the pursuit of truth just as much as its academia.    A nation that can be called HOME for its citzens and descendants all over the world.    A continent that loves its people and doesn't suffer from the actions of leaders that abuse their power.    To create solutions for major diseases affecting African lives  including malaria and HIV/AIDS.    This is the grand vision that I have for the people that I care so much about  but in order to do that I first need your help ! Regardless of whether its through financial help  wisdom or networking  I have a vision to create a better world that isn't just about myself or what I can gain out of this  that's why any advice and support is just as greatly appreciatied.    WHY AM I DOING THIS ?    I want to create a world where we stop protesting about being shot  killed or mistreated and can begin to celebrate the evolution of how powerful we truly are and how far we've come. I know I am not the first to have thought of all these ideals but I know I will be the first to deliver them for the benefit of others.      I would like to thank anyone that has read this far  and I wish nothing but the best for you and your loved ones. I am only one mind  but I would appreciate any exchange of thoughts and ideas to build a better world.    Below are a list of the commitments that I will make to the people who are kind enough to aid me in my goals  I've also attached a document of why I am qualified for the role.    If I exceed my targets for my crowdfunding  I will take my first initative by providing new built homes and foodbanks to the people of Libya and Haiti as part of my start-up initative charity and think-tank called Heaven estates.com    Thank you for your time !

All proceeds raised will be split between the two causes. Fund raising causes: NI Scrubs - This is a volunteer group set up to help frontline NHS staff with protective clothing and scrubs which they are currently short on supplies. Money raised will help towards fabric costs and sourcing and then distributed to a group of volunteers who make the clothing for our amazing frontline staff. This will help them deal with this crisis in a safe  protected  environment. Dundonald Foodbank - Foodbank branches across the UK have been providing a valuable service to those on low income needing help to feed themselves and their familes for a number of years. Now more than ever they need our help to help those most in need. A cash donation will enable them to buy much needed food and items that are low on stock. I am raising money for the local foodbank in Dundonald to help my community. Event: On Saturday 25th April I will be running a Solo Marathon 26.2 miles in my street. This will in adhere with social distancing rules as I will be the sole participant. I will be running up and down the length of my Cul-de-sac approximately 290 times to cover the full marathon distance. Thank you all for your generosity ."

The hair dye ended up taking 4 weeks to arrive  by which point he’d changed his mind. The moment had passed and it seemed pointless.     To encourage him to do it again  my Mum and I thought we needed a reason to make him do it and decided that with so much going on in the world right now  we could try and make the tiniest bit of difference by doing it for charity; My mum is now jumping on the bandwagon and dying her hair too.     Now I’m fully aware that he’s not jumping out a plane  running a marathon or shaving his head but he’s 74 so give him his due. It would be fantastic if anyone could donate literally ANY amount  even a pound - I’m a self employed singer in a Global Pandemic. I FEEL YOU.     The money raised will be split evenly between two very worthy causes at this time;    THE BLACK CURRICULUM    ‘The Black Curriculum is a social enterprise founded in 2019 by young people to address the lack of Black British history in the UK Curriculum. We believe that by delivering arts focused Black history programmes  providing teacher training and campaigning through mobilising young people  we can facilitate social change.’    THE TRUSSELL TRUST FOOD BANK NETWORK    ‘We don’t think anyone in our community should have to face going hungry. That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks  supported by The Trussell Trust  working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.‘    I’d like to think that even if we raised £50 we have done it for good reason and tried to support these causes in any way we can when we’re on lockdown!     It would give us happy little hearts if you could donate and share. "

Back before all this madness started I sillily signed myself up to do my first ever half marathon  the Hackney Half on the 17th May  SO when coming into lockdown I decided that although this event was likely to be cancelled  I would still like to try and push myself to run the distance on the original date and hopefully raise a bit of money for a worthwhile charity that needs support more than ever.     I am not a runner and it has been a painful slog trying to motivate and keep training. In less than 2 weeks I'm going to attempt the 21K that I would have been running in Hackney and hope that the cheering from my family will be enough to get me round the course as opposed to the huge crowds that would have been at the real event!     I'd like to raise some money in aid of The Trussell Trust an amazing charity that supports UK food banks and every donation will help. At the moment 81% more emergency food parcels being given out across the UK  including 122% more parcels going to children compared to this time last year.    I know so many people have used food as a means to brighten up their quarantine so I think it is so important that this is shared to those who are struggling to feed their families and even put one meal on their table a day. Anything you can donate would be hugely appreciated and will hopefully help keep a family fed throughout these uncertain times.     I'll be posting the death of my running career on the 17th and knowing that we've been able to support others in need will hopefully help me get round the distance!!     Thank you so much if you choose to donate!

My life has been privileged and compared to most  easy. So instead of getting drunk on cheap wine and eating cake  I will play video games for 12 hours & raise money for two foundations that are near to my heart.     First up - Stand Against Racism & Inequality. For those who are unaware  my half-brother is black. We were adopted when we were younger  and out of our many siblings  the majority of them are black. Living in a small Illinois town they were an oddity  and racism did exist. Not a day goes by where my family & I do not worry about each other  but we worry more about the ones who can be murdered for just being black in a white world.     50% of the donations that are raised over the course of the fundraiser will be donated to Stand up Against Racism & Inequality.     You can learn more about the charity by visiting their website: https://www.sariweb.org.uk/who-we-are/about-sari/      This is not a Black Lives Matter only organization  but helps with all racism  bigotry  and sexism. But their focus is helping victims of hate crimes  and with those on the rise in the UK we can all agree that its a good cause.       The second foundation is Paddington Partnership: https://www.thisispaddington.com/paddington-partnership/about-us    They work with businesses in the Paddington area to raise money  donate their time and help out at some of the less fortunate areas of Paddington. This is interesting because our Building we work in is about 50 Million  but if I cross the street and walk 3 minutes  there's a crap block of flats full of people struggling. Paddington Partnership takes the privileged workers in these fancy offices & pairs them with programs and events to help those in need.     My team at work read with the students of King Solomon Academy every week  and have for nearly 3 years now. I personally run a monthly bookclub at the Marlybone Woman's shelter where we're currently reading David Sedaris.    On top of that  every year 3-4 groups get together to help in the community in various ways. Food banks  Soup Kitchens  putting a party on for Halloween or even gardening & cleaning the school grounds.     50% of the proceeds will be sent to Paddington Partnership to be split 3 ways between the following:    King Solomon Academy:https://kingsolomonacademy.org/about-us/welcome-2  The Marlybone Project: https://www.maryleboneproject.org.uk/  The North Paddington Foodbank: https://www.npfoodbank.org.uk/      If you are able to donate  I would appreciate it. If you can not donate  please help by spreading the word. I can't change the world alone  but together maybe we can make a start in the right direction. Thank you."

In 2019 our Charles Stanley Christmas elves were busier than ever!   Due to the current pandemic  more and more families are turning to foodbanks to make ends meet and they need our support now more than ever.   Charles Stanley has pledged to match any donations we as an office can raise  up to a whopping £1 000  which is wonderful.  Times are hard right now but if you can spare a donation to help the foodbank continue the amazing work they do  please do.   As we are supporting our local foodbank directly rather than the national organisation (The Trussell Trust) I will send everyone that donates a gift aid form to accompany their donation so the charity can reclaim the tax."

Sadly food banks are now commonplace in our society with the largest UK food bank organisation  Trussell Trust  reporting its network’s busiest ever period due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 81% more emergency food parcels are being given out across the UK  including 122% more parcels going to children  compared to the same period in 2019.    Our local community is fantastic in providing food donations  however the food bank still requires financial support for running costs to keep its doors open.    Here's where I need your help! I am going to try and raise £500 for the food bank by completing a 30-mile bike ride (indoors to ensure compliance with lockdown rules) on Saturday 16th May.     There will be a live stream of my bike ride on the REC Facebook page  so feel free to cheer me on with messages of support.     I would really appreciate it if you would sponsor me on this bike ride  so we can keep the food bank going and feeding the most vulnerable in our community."

I have also become aware that during Lockdown  Mark Cavendish (he’s a professional cyclist for those who haven’t heard of him) had completed a Virtual Everesting. The idea behind this is to complete a bike ride where the vertical climb is the same as the summit of mount Everest by going up and down the same stretch of road as many times as it takes to complete the 8849 meter ascent of Everest. And because I am an idiot  this sounded like something I should attempt.    Claire  Aidan and Emmy have suggested that if they are going to give up the front room of our home for a day (I’m aiming to finish it in 14hrs) then the least they should get out of it is the knowledge that some money was raised for a good cause not just pandering to my stupidity in the face of a challenge. As a result  I am going to try to raise as much money as possible for the Trussell Trust.

When we hear the word ‘poverty’ we often think of children in third world countries who have absolutely nothing and although these children are suffering and need our help too  we also have millions of people on our doorstep using foodbanks every day to feed their families. The wage gap in our country is ever growing under our current government and until we can make big changes to stop it once and for all- we must do what we can to individually help those around us. I used to work as a door-to-door charity fundraiser and often found that the most generous people were those with virtually nothing. They always wanted to sign up and do what they could to help as they knew what it was like to struggle that much. These people have inspired me for years and now I want to do something to help give back. So this is why I have decided to do a sponsored fast to help raise funds for a foodbank Initiative in my favourite place in the UK- Hackney! So thank you very much in advance for your donation as every tiny bit makes a huge difference. Big love  Martha ❤️x"

We now need your support for materials to produce these masks.    We are hoping to raise £1 000 in order to produce 2 000 masks.

Follow along on Instagram @indiabach    I had these two weeks booked off work to go on a romantic history tour of Italy with my husband it's something we do every year and we always look forward to it  we were starting in Venice and making our way to Naples over the two weeks.     As you can imagine that hasn't gone to plan and as I work in a shop rather than having my two weeks off I've found myself like all of us in lock down for atleast three weeks.     Struggling to find food on empty shelves and having the luxury of being able to grab the last that was left whilst making small essentials trips I couldn't help but think how terrifying this time must be for those who were already struggling to buy food. Now with children off school the pressure must be unbelievable.     I personally suffer with at times intense anxiety and depression so recently purchased an indoor exercise bike which during these times has been a live saver.     Challenging myself to add an extra kilometer each day to my morning cycle it suddenly hit me that in 6 days I had hit 76 kilometres and thought to myself this morning  ""what if I could ride the length of venice to naples."" that combined with feeling utterly useless in the fight again this virus  whilst so many are working day and night to help. I decided I would start a donation page to go along with my personal little cycle challenge. If the only person who donates is me then I really don't mind but I would be so grateful if you could spare even a £1 to go towards this amazing charity!!     So here it is 76 kilometres down  649 to go!       This is very thrown together last minute so bare with me but to be honest what hasn't been thrown together last minute recently!!

My friend Emma and myself are challenging ourselves this year and have decided to do our very first mountain climb. Scaling England's highest mountain  Scafell Pike.     I know people who have to scratch about for money every month to be able to pay for bills and other essentials but  are still left wondering how to feed themselves and their children and it's just getting worse.... No one should have to do this but luckily there are food banks that can help out. I would like to raise some money so I can donate it to our local food bank ""The Cromer & District Foodbank"" to help them buy a few supplies. I don't know how much that will be but I hope anything is a help to them and the people that use the food banks.    Statistics taken from The Trussel Trust:    Between 1st April 2017 and 31st March 2018  The Trussell Trust’s foodbank network distributed 1 332 952 three day emergency food supplies to people in crisis  a 13% increase on the previous year. 484 026 of these went to children.    So if you are one of the lucky ones who can afford to spare a small amount  please think about sharing it with those who can't. Really  I would appreciate any donation. Plus  I need to get my bum up that mountain so please give me a little boost to get up there!     The climb will take place on June 15th 2019 (weather depending).

It is during this unprecedented time that we need to come together and do our share to help those impacted the most. We (Vik Mohith  Phil Tucker  Michael Brouder  Robert Palmer and Brian Macy) have decided to start this fundraising scheme on behalf of The Trussell Trust. As a result of the pandemic  families with little or no income  are falling behind and are struggling to provide themselves with the basics such as food. The Trussell Trust support a nationwide network of food banks and provide emergency food to those in need. Foodbank use has shown a steady increase over the last few years (Between April 2018 and March 2019  food banks in the Trussell Trust network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis  a 19% increase on the previous year) – the current pandemic will most likely increase the demand for these invaluable resources. We've come up with the idea of using a nomination system where we start with nominating 4 or more friends or colleagues to donate however much can be spared to the Trussell Trust. The nominees will each hopefully donate and/or nominate another 4 or more friends or colleagues who then do the same. This ripple effect will hopefully help us reach our goal. We absolutely appreciate that a donation may not be possible for everyone  but nominations will help spread the message of the good work the Trussell Trust do to those who may be able to help in a material way. Donations of food and essential non-food items such as toiletries and hygiene products can also be made at collection points in supermarkets across the country. We hope that you will join us on this journey in achieving this goal – together we can make a difference! Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to us. We hope you’re staying healthy and positive in these uncertain times Vik Mohith  Phil Tucker  Michael Brouder  Robert Palmer and Brian Macy More information about The Trussell Trust: The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion.

As well as running a medical centre  they work with some of the poorest communities to improve health  nutrition and living conditions. Patzún  where I lived has a lot of poverty and now  with the current pandemic  this situation has only worsened. As in the UK  people have been unwell or died from the virus and many people have found themselves unable to work - only in Guatemala there is no furlough scheme  no NHS  no foodbank and no benefits of any kind. If a household has absolutely no food  they are draping a white flag out of their home (or just holding it up in the street if they are homeless) and the village will do what they can to share their food.    Through friends of mine living in Patzun  I have recently become aware of a widow  named Doña Filipa. She lives in a home made of corrugated iron with her three sons  Alex (16 years)  Eddie (15) and Jonatan (11). The elder two boys used to help their mother with living costs by doing whatever work they could – manual work  selling ice-creams and so on. However  a month ago  the sons were out collecting wood for their mother when they slipped and fell 25 metres down a ravine  resulting in one boy having a serious hip and rib injury and the other boy with broken legs. They are bed-ridden and both urgently need medical attention and operations. However  as there is no NHS in Guatemala  they would need to pay the hospital £2000 for this to take place  which is simply not possible. I have already managed to raise half of this amount  but I wondered if  by sharing their story here  some of my lovely friends might be willing to contribute a small amount towards helping this family out. The money will be sent to Asociación Vida*  who will oversee any support we can offer this family – ideally enabling the sons to receive all the medical attention they need. Any help would be wonderful. If you want more detail about this  please message me – I just didn’t want to write too much on here. Thank you     *Asociación Vida is a registered charity  partnered by Tearfund UK."

More information about Hestia Housing and Support: We support people in crisis including victims of modern slavery  women and children who have experienced domestic abuse  young care leavers and older people. From giving someone a home  to helping them to get the right mental health support  we support people at the moment of crisis and enable them to build a life beyond a crisis. We are supported by more than 460 volunteers across London who provide specialist skills such as art therapy  yoga  IT  gardening & cooking  as well as befriending & fundraising.    Lockdown has been challenging for everyone  but for those living with profound trauma  coronavirus has heightened fears and prolonged recovery. Children in Hestia’s refuges have been isolated from friends  school and any sense of normality after escaping abusive households. Unable to run around and play  they have been confined to their bedrooms for their safety. We fear this could result in a long-term impact on their mental health and education.     How you can help    That is why Hestia is launching the Summer Wellbeing Programme (a change on their usual Summer Play Scheme). We know these families will continue to need specialist support with their recovery through therapeutic support along with other essential items over the summer holidays such as activities and games.     Every donation made during Big Give will be doubled and go directly to Summer Wellbeing Programme to help these families build a life beyond crisis.     Blerta’s story (as told by Alex her advocate)    Blerta* is a survivor of modern slavery and has two young children. She relies on emergency food parcels from Hestia and foodbanks to support her family.     Blerta and her family live in shared accommodation with other asylum seekers. This has been increasingly difficult as one of her daughters struggles with health issues meaning they have been unable to leave the house. The family are feeling really isolated and low as they need to stay in their room. Blerta will wait for the other residents to leave the kitchen before she deep cleans and then prepares food for her family so she is not having any social contact with anyone else.    Berta’s favourite reflection from last summer is the trip to the zoo she was able to go on with her daughters through Hestia’s summer programme  it was the highlight of their summer. Her children were able to return to school in September with a story of their summer to share with the class. The summer programme not only funded the trip to the zoo but also enabled each family to take a keepsake family photo of the day home with them which Blerta explained to her case worker it was the first family photo they had ever had and she was so thankful for Hestia arranging this trip."

From me to Caister-on-sea it is 184km. I hope to do this by the end of April. Thank you in advance  Stay safe and stay home. "

We cannot depend physical donations alone  and therefore rely on monetary donations to buy in most of our stock.    Before the outbreak of Covid-19  North Paddington Foodbank was serving ~130 households  or ~200 people  per week through a drop-in session every Wednesday.   Now  we run a home-delivery only service 5-6 days a week  and are serving upwards of 700 households  or ~1000 people per week. This is possible only due to the help of our hard-working volunteers.      On top of this  foodbanks currently do not receive any special treatment from supermarkets  limiting them to the two items per customer rule. This means we have no choice but to buy in stock from wholesalers  which  coupled with the exponential growth in customers  has led to a huge growth in our expenses.     Any donation you can make will massively help us to continue supporting vulnerable people in our community. Thank you for your support."

Millions of people and families in Britain have to make the horrible decision to either eat or stay clean because they are living in such dire poverty that they cannot afford to do both. We do not think that is fair  and so we are here to help.       Beauty Banks  which we established together in February 2019  distributes unused toiletries to registered charitable organisations throughout Britain who  in turn  distribute them to their clients who desperately need them. So far we have supplied hundreds of registered charities in the UK with hygiene parcels including Foodbanks  homeless shelters  refugees  NHS Trusts  Youth Centres  Community Trusts and refugee organisations.       We send the products most of us take for granted and can't imagine living our daily existence without like shampoo  deodorant  shower gel  soap  toothpaste and disposable razors. The products that make us clean and able to face the world. Not luxuries but essentials for our general health our mental health and our wellbeing.       So far - as we wait for our official charity status to be confirmed - Beauty Banks has been 100% self-funded. We've managed to reach thousands of people across the UK because of the incredible goodwill  kindness and generosity of our amazing supporters. We are and will remain homemade and grassroots because we want the few pennies we do raise and spend to go towards donations and delivery costs.       WE NEED YOUR HELP PLEASE.    The summer holidays are putting a massive strain on our charity partners as this is the worst time of year for Britain's poorest children. Official figures report that 3 million children who rely on the school not only for education but also for social engagement (friend-time)  pastoral care and a square meal the holidays are a hellish and lonely time. So they rely on our charity partners to support them and help them survive the summer.     For Beauty Banks this means we are overrun with requests for support and donations. We are fortunate that our amazing supporters continue to help us do what we do by generously sending us products week after week. The help we need at the moment is some funding to cover the costs of getting donations where they need to go. So if you can help by sparing a few pounds we would be SO GRATEFUL.     No donation is too small but it will make a big difference to us and the people we serve.     THANK YOU Love Jo & Sali"

I am raising money for a school trip to Borneo in 2021. Here is some more information about what we will be doing on our trip:    Borneo has the world’s oldest primary rainforests  dating back 140 million years  that are home to 200 species of mammals  400 species of birds and 15 000 species of flowers. Many of these can only be found in Borneo. Some of these include the endangered Bornean Orangutans  Proboscis Monkeys  The Pygmy Elephant and the Hornbill.     On this wonderful journey I will be learning about:    · conservation  the protection of endangered species and traditional cultures    · Biodiversity  ecosystems and environmental protection.    · Ecotourism and sustainable development.     During our stay we will take part in a forest rehabilitation project. This project will include learning about how conservationists and the locals seek to conserve and protect the vitally important rainforest. We will also be taught about the Borneo Fig Project which is a Rhino reserve.     During our trip we will be visiting the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre. This is a rehabilitation centre for these tiny bears as their populations are under threat due to deforestation and hunting for Chinese medicine. We will be learning about their natural environment and what the centre is doing to boost populations in the wild.     We will also be visiting a rainforest discovery centre. Here we will be going on trails through the forest  including canopy walks. We will be learning about this hugely important ecosystem.     We will be able to observe and immerse ourselves in the Kinabatangan community  while learning to make boats  fish traps and many more things!     The most exciting part of the trip for me is the Jungle trek where we will begin learning bush skills and jungle survival techniques. We will be fire lighting and setting up hammocks to sleep in!         Covid 19 however  has deterred our Borneo groups from making money easily. Therefore  we have tried to think of ideas that are within the legal boundaries during this time  which has led us to the conclusion of exercise! Lots and lots of exercise! We have opted for cycling.     Eight others in my Borneo group and I have decided to link our fundraising with the current situation and are going to cycle the distance from Wuhan to Malmesbury. (A total of 5575 Miles)  making that 620 miles each. We have set a target of September to complete this.     Individually we are collecting sponsorship for our efforts  if you are willing to contribute to my cause I have included my bank details below. I will update you periodically on my progress as I complete this challenge. I will also be donating 10% of the donations to the foodbank in Malmesbury to aid those that require a little extra help  during these difficult times specifically. Any donation  no matter how small would be gratefully received!     I also have an easyfundraising page where money is generated for my cause at no cost to you  simply by going through my link and buying what you normally would online (for example  Amazon  eBay  John Lewis  supermarkets and many more!) You can set a reminder up so that you are prompted to use it before purchase. Anything at all that you would not normally think of would be a huge help to me  for example  many are now working from home  so office supplies are required!

The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed many families into poverty as the disruption to the economy has left millions of people newly unemployed or furloughed.    Food banks have seen a massive rise in demand as many people are struggling to afford food. However  it has been difficult for food banks to get the supplies they need. Donations have slowed down as people have stockpiled items to see themselves through the pandemic.     Our food bank is situated at Middlesex University in Hendon  London. It usually runs on donations but as the number of our beneficiaries grow we urgently need funds to continue running this important service. Your donation would go towards buying food and supporting the daily operational costs of this crucial resource.     A donation of any size would be greatly appreciated. If you cannot afford to donate  you can help us by spreading the word about our cause.    About Us    The Nations Africa centre (‘NAC’) is a Registered UK Charity that supports the Algerian community within the UK and promotes social cohesion by bringing the traditions and diverse culture of Algeria to the wider public. We provide services such as immigration advice  shelter referrals  and job skills training as well as holding social events like community dinners.    We have established a number of projects during this crisis  including providing a mental health helpline and delivering free food parcels to vulnerable people. We have worked to provide NHS staff with food and 3D-print face masks for those of them on the front lines.    Charity no.1157212"

I can't emphasise enough how grateful we are that dad is receiving all the support he needs which allows him to be financially  physically and mentally safe and secure  I would love to see everyone as fortunate as dad.    So  I saw this video on the news earlier today and it hit me so hard that someone like Kenny  who needs to be well looked after in a hospital or care home  (as he recently had his left leg Amputated  has Type-1 Diabetes  is at high risk of COVID-19)  is firstly  removed from the hospital care he was receiving due to the Coronavirus crisis demanding more beds (which is not fair but it is just that the priority is given to those who are struggling to breathe  of course)  secondly  he is travelling about 2 hours  in his wheelchair  all alone  to get the bare minimum amount of food to be able to survive.    Why? Because his disability benefits haven't started yet  because he can't stay stuck at home and wait for someone to get him food because there is no one to help him  because he doesn't have the money to go to a grocery store nearby  so he goes through all this struggle to get food that he doesn't even feel is enough for a person to be satisfied with fully but it is better than nothing at all and so he is grateful that this service is available for people who are struggling financially.    https://news.sky.com/video/coronavirus-amputee-forced-to-travel-two-hours-for-food-11974808    I understand that many of you may be going through your own problems due to this crisis such as being unemployed and possibly struggling financially yourself  or being a key worker and having to deal with added pressure at work or you may be a vulnerable person yourself. I do not intend to make you feel guilty for being unhappy about your own issues at this time  our own problems are the biggest hurdles for us and cannot to compared to those of others  it cannot be weighed against Kenny's or anyone else's  I completely understand that.    I  however  am very fortunate to be living at home with parents and not having to worry about money  food and shelter. Due to this privilege  I have decided to do something worthwhile for others who aren't nearly as fortunate as I am and so I request you all to please take a look at the attached video and maybe do more research to see the facts for yourself and if you are not struggling financially  physically and/or mentally  then please do donate  whatever you can  to help the charitable organisation- The Trussell Trust and allow them to carry on doing the wonderful job they are persistently doing every day to help people like Kenny and many others with less or more severe hurdles.     I am personally donating to this charity myself as I am unable to leave the house right now to protect my dad  given his high risk of contracting the virus as he is a stroke patient  partially paralysed  with many other health conditions and a weakened immune system . Hence why I have decided to additionally start this fund-raising page because I cannot physically go out and volunteer to help charities like this carry on doing the crucial work that they are doing. Helping them with donations and spreading the message across is the most I can do at the moment and so  that is what I will do. Please do what you can do.    1. you can donate money through the link in this post and it will go directly to The Trussell Trust who will then allocate the money for many food banks throughout the UK : https://www.trusselltrust.org/what-we-do/how-foodbanks-work/    2. you can also join this campaign to help fast track the start date of Government funded Benefits such as Universal Credit  for everyone who desperately needs financial support so that they no longer need to collect food from food banks and can afford to buy food for themselves. If you cannot donate money then please still join this campaign to be helping in some way : https://action.trusselltrust.org/help-create-future-without-food-banks    3. you can also donate food at your local food banks. I have found the link for you to find a food bank near you more easily so if you cannot donate money but are able to give some spare bits of food away then please do so : https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/find-a-foodbank/    4. if you are unable to do any of the above then please just pray in your own ways  to any power you believe in or even just send positive thoughts and well wishes for everyone suffering because of this crisis and irrespective of it.      * let us all help in any way or in every way that we can  the least we can do is try to have and give hope.

They are a wonderful community space whose mantra is ""no one should feel alone.""    In response to the lockdown  they diligently asked what they could do in order to affect the most good  and they were told to start a foodbank- which is exactly what they have done! Many people don't know that Islington as an area is massively underserved in terms of foodbanks and equivalent support  so The Arc Centre has stepped up in a huge way.     They also offer loads of online classes and host an online coffee morning every Friday at 10amBST for anyone who fancies a socially responsible chat.     We cannot say enough good about these guys- so check them out for yourselves at The Arc Centre website .     Even if you are unable to donate  we so appreciate your support and viewship. You can always help us by spreading the word  giving @mizlinzyoga a follow and staying safe!

My name is Georgia - I'm a 19 year-old student from Wiltshire. For the past few years  I have fundraised for Trowbridge's local food bank  Storehouse. In 2017  my friends and school helped me raise £500 for the incredible charity which did a world of good for those who use the food bank to survive. The work our bank does is phenomenal  providing support to those in the community who need it most.     The Goal:  My plan is to raise £60. To some  it may not seem like a lot of money  but in terms of basic toiletries and other such necessities I have often felt I take for granted  such as washing up liquid  access to sanitary products and deodorants  £60 can provide tens and tens of hygiene items to those who need it most.     With the money I raise from my own donation (which I am submitting towards the project as soon as it is launched)  alongside any donations I kindly receive through this incentive  I will be taking a planned trip to my local Tesco store and completing my shopping list (below) for the food bank  then dropping it off with them directly. I'll do this in order for Storehouse to have these toiletries and items immediately to distribute.     Covid-19:  Now  more than ever  we must stand with our community. We recognise those in need and unashamedly support them when they make the brave decision to ask for support.     I have decided to focus this effort as a Hygiene Drive  due to the current coronavirus circumstances  as practices such as hand washing as more essential now more than ever.     Thank you so much for reading - I hope it has inspired you to be able to give back to those less fortunate when you are in the position to. I will be eternally grateful for any donations anybody could contribute towards this cause  or by sharing my fundraiser or Facebook post.     I will keep everybody updated with the project as soon as it is live.     Georgia Richards x    Information:   Here is what I plan to buy with the funds raised:   > Toothpaste  toothbrushes  nappies  hand soap  baby wipes  face wipes  cotton wool  washing up liquid  pet food  shower gel  razors  sanitary towels  tampons  shaving gel  deodorants  body sprays  toilet roll  laundry detergent  toilet cleaner  babyfood  sponges.     Figures on poverty and usage of food banks:   > £30 can support an individual for a week's groceries and toiletries items.   > £40 can support a couple in need for a week.   > £50 can keep a family safe  fed and clean for a week.   > The need for charities such as Storehouse is high  there are over 2000 banks in the UK which help feed our country's hungry.   > In 2018-2019  1 583 668 people accessed food banks throughout the UK.

I hope you're doing OK in these tough & uncertain times.     Today marks 2 months since lockdown measures were introduced in the UK. It's difficult to concisely describe the upheaval that's ensued in the wake  imparting job losses on many of the poorest low paid workers in our society. Despite lockdown putting an end to my own plans to go and coach tennis in Tamil Nadu  India for an eye-opening experience  my eyes are very much open to the far greater losses others have endured.    Thus  I had a think as to how I could help in my own way  in the covid-triggered absence of typical in-person volunteering that I love to fill my spare-time with; cycling was a no-brainer  given how much I love rolling on two wheels while promoting the mental & physical benefits of regular exercise.     However  I was also aware that  given how much time I spend on the bike  I needed to push the bounds a bit to make the activity more of a sacrifice than simply another training session; especially in light of the sacrifice our key workers are making every day in keeping the country ticking.    Henceforth  I arrived at the 300km target. Beyond the fact that it provides nice mathematical symmetry to an achievable fundraising goal for 1 week  it's over double of my usual biweekly training ride (135k). I'm undertaking it in my garden on the turbo in order to have a sustainable source of water & nutrition (especially given the covid-triggered closure of beloved cafes in my chilterns!). It'll likely take 11-12 hours to complete dependent on temperature  and will be by far & away my biggest ride to date! (Smashing the mountainous 170km I rode in the Dolomites last year!) I expect it to be quite painful after the 7 hour mark  and have been meticuklously been planning my playlist to distract from the intense quad-muscle fatigue.    Now onto the important bit; why I'm doing it? Foodbanks were already an issue of crisis in the UK before we entered this new world; between 2018 and 2019  the Trussell Trust delivered 1.6m emergency 3-day food parcels  a 19% increase on the previous year; more shockingly  annual use of the TT's services has risen 73% over 5-years  with children attributed to around a THIRD of the demand.    I've been very loud in recent times about the heightened importance of (safe) outdoor exercise right now  due to the power it holds in fighting depressive emotions and protecting our health (and subsequently  the pressured health service). But  there is no escaping the fact; if people cannot put food on the table  they cannot access these benefits; indeed  malnutrition takes more away from them than simply the ability to run 10k; 500k children arrive at school hungry each day  vastly limiting their potential to achieve highly and rise up the precarious social mobility ladder.    Thanks so much for reading this mini-essay; I hope it's struck a chord with you and provided a bitesized insight into the critical issue of food poverty today. It is saddening to contemplate  but the pandemic's dual attack on low-paid employment and public service provisions in the likely future austerity-era will only make the above figures worse. I'm aware of the awkwardness of asking for donations during such a financially-challenging time  but if you consider yourself privileged and would be able to make a contribution  I would be most grateful.      Luke xx    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE: Saturday 7th June     Hello! I hope you're all coping amidst the increasingly tragic situation displayed on the news globally. I hope this can provide a nice little positive respite and inspire more exercise fundraisers!    I've seen many of my cycling and adventure photographer heroes recently attempt the 'Everest' Challenge; this is fairly simple in nature  albeit momentous in the numbers. Basically  the aim is to climb the equivalent of Mt Everest (from sea level  not the prominence you geographic geeks) in one bike ride; this can either be done by repeating a single climb on the open road  or on a stationary turbo equipped to monitor power & gradients in a virtual course.     I'll be doing the latter for two reasons; firstly  there aren't really any long climbs in my end of the UK  and a short hill would mean thousands of reps and potentially more traffic collision risk; secondly  this is easily going to be the toughest physical challenge I've ever done! Thus  I'm going to need to have some respite in the form of accessible water and nutrition!    While the length of the ride will inevitably be shorter than 300k  averaging 100-120 from the attempts I've seen so far  the horrific gradient and 8 848m of climbing means it'll take in my estimation about 14-15hours; in addition  muscle fatigue will probably be much worse given the slower pedalling uphill vs fast flats  where motion helps to dissipate any lactic acid buildup and provide constant oxygen to my quads!    Why am I doing this abusrdity? Basically the same reasons as before multiplied 2-fold; I want to undergo some pain and sacrifice to honour the incredible work of all essential workers during this pandemic. It is a sad paradox that many of these will not be far off the food-banks this is all raising money for  given the under-inflation pay rises over the last couple of years against rising urban property prices."

It has built resilience for many and brought many communities together. It has also been extremely tough on local businesses and charities serving our local community.    We at Rhydyfelin RFC pride ourselves at being heart of the community especially our Mini and Junior Team who are a talented and inspiring group of children. They wanted to do something to help current circumstances. As we hugely salute the key workers of the country and the outstanding efforts on fighting this virus  keeping the economy going and the efforts from groups and individuals fundraising for the larger organisations such as the NHS  our thoughts turn to local charities who are also struggling. Pontypridd food bank last year alone distributed 2 042 3-day emergency food supplies to the local community.   We would really like to be able to help them through this tough time and donate even more to them as incomes are getting less  more and more people are becoming unemployed and the food bank is needed by more people.    Please help us to help our local community. Our talented mini rugby team have been hardat work staying safe at home  keeping up beatand have produced a video for you. (Availableon our Facebook page). All we ask is if you like the video and please donate. Many thanks     Rhydyfelin RFC Mini’s & Juniors xx "

As is the case for everyone in the country with a conscience  the current state of Westminster politics is causing me and my peers a massive amount of distress and rage and worry. I am a working class artist from the West of Scotland  sick of T*ries  sick of br*xiteers  sick of what The Union means for us  and those less privileged than us.     I have set up this fundraiser to get a wee donations pot together for Rape Crisis Glasgow and Clyde   and for the foodbank of my native Inverclyde. As you will likely know  marginalised people are those effected most by Tory cuts  corruption  and cruelty. Marginalised people are also the victims of more violent crime and sexual violence. It would be naive to deny the correlation between these two truths  especially when accused rapists are allowed to fumble their way through Office in the most powerful nations in the world  and then deny the impact that their evil has upon the most vulnerable  instead accusing them of causing the very violence they've been subjected to.     If you don't believe that the Tories are deadly  then I can't convince you to give to their victims. But if you feel the same way that I do  that we must use our privileges to support those being let down (read: murdered) by the people paid handsomely to protect them  then please consider giving anything you can to these worthy charities.     Every donor who pledges £10 or more will receive exclusive signed a5 prints of my Boris Johnson ""Eton Mess"" illustration  and my fellow Glasgow School of Art educated artist  Olivia Topalian's G7 summit illustration of Johnson and Trump. These will be sustainably printed in Glasgow and sent to you when this fundraiser ends!     Every penny counts towards our goal  which is set at the price it costs Rape Crisis  on average  (£700) to provide a service to each survivor who contacts them plus the same for the essential costs of a Foodbank in a community hit hard by austerity and industry decline.     In the interest of transparency  please note that each piece will cost £0.75 to print  and that this campaign will use the donations to cover this cost. 85% of your £10 donation will still go to Rape Crisis and the Foodbank  and no profits will be made by ourselves. Because we're not greedy Conservatives.     Thank you for your time    We hope you will choose to help our cause      Choirstaidh x    "

Imagine what it's like now  more than two months on since people were furloughed or stopped receiving any income from jobs no longer available. I've also found myself wondering if folk are still donating into the food boxes at the supermarkets or if they are lying empty with more people shopping through click and collect or home deliveries.     “We are delivering to people who are self-isolating or who are just too anxious to step outside and in place of our holidays support programme for families with school-age children  we have been distributing food packs instead and in some cases we have also been delivering cooked lunches.    People are feeling very lonely and isolated and that’s particularly the case for people who are already dealing with mental health issues and with so many support workers now having to work from home  we are filling in the gaps that this has created.”    Check out their website to hear about the charity's advice and employability services too.

Hi my name is Leon Richards  I am a dad  a book author  a life coach  Nutritionist  personal trainer  blogger  youtube vlogger from london england. I have started this much needed campaign to help & continue raise awareness of homelessness and support homeless communities around the world  starting within my home town in London  England. My aim is to try and raise as much funds as possible to help provide food  clothing and support for the many homeless adults  children & families within our local communities. Over the last 15 years  there has been a major shift in our societies globally  with worldwide extreme sharp increases in austerity & poverty. In london where I'm from  the cost of living Is ridiculously high to say the least. renting or buying even a very small studio flat  in london is a pipe dream. With this in mind"" in generally global poverty & austerity is still on the rise and at a all time high. with child poverty affecting more & more families worldwide. The share number of homeless families is truely shocking and a matter that should concern all of us. In particular  the last few years living in london has been a real challenge for many families. With many families turning to foodbanks and extended families for support. With my GoFundMe campaign  i hope to raise enough funds to buy blankets  sanitary products  food  water and clothing to support the millions of homeless families & communities worldwide. At present I do not have a figure in mind that I would to raise  so have set the campaign figure at £100 000 as a bench mark. However I believe to seriously make a difference and a significant contribution to this global crisis. I would like us to try and raise £10 000 monthly and £100 000 over a period of 12 months. I believe this amount of funds would be a good starting point & a truely great start to this campaign. All funds raised will be spent sensibly and would help to provide thousands of homeless adults & children & families with the absolute essential they need to survive on our The way I see it  we are all children of god  and it's up to us as spiritual beings  to stand together as a unit and love each other unconditionally regardless of  ethnicity  race  religion or sexuality. Life is very pressure & time is very short  I strongly believe every good deed counts in gods eyes  and will be appreciated and blessed by the almighty. I was a great admirer of Princess Diana & micheal jacksons individual charity work. They both did amazing charity work and were truely remarkable human beings. We all have kindness & love installed deep within our souls from birth  and sometimes in life us as human beings  forget how to use these pure emotions & abilities. Well i have good news for you all  heres your chance  God is watching. Please donate  and let me know how you feel after you have made a donation. from my own personal ongoing experiences  Giving to others is great"" and spiritual in some way. So everyone  please when you are generally out and about and see a genuine homeless person  try giving them a sandwich and a bottle of water if possible & share your stories with me. I strongly believe helping each other is essential for all of us  and will be fundamental in shaping all of our futures. Please support my campaign and help me  help the homeless with your support. Once again thank you for all your donations and support. May God Bless & love you all. Kindest Regards Leon Richards Thank you."

Where to begin? I found myself reading about foodbanks and shortages which led me to realise how vitally important it is for families and individuals to receive resources which are out of reach now more than ever. The truth is that I felt pretty damn angry and knew that this is where I needed to put my efforts.    At the end of 2019 I had decided I would commit to doing 100 hikes over the next few years. Of course  events have put that on hold - but not completely. I am beginning this challenge by climbing mountains indoors via staircases and intend to hit 25 'hikes' by July/August of 2020 and to continue on beyond. It won't be the most glamorous of adventures but it's one I'm sure glad to be able to do. I'll be donning my outdoor gear and charting these indoor hikes to provide a little amusement!

It isn't just the physical and emotional effect  but financial too.    Many families and individuals are struggling to make ends meet  and some may have furry companions literally eating into their budgets.    This campaign is to help raise money for pet food which will be distributed to various foodbanks around the UK as well as smaller dog and cat charities and rehoming centres.    Charities and rehoming centres are also hit hard as many donations have stopped and shops and events that help raise money are closed or cannot go ahead at this current time.    Funds will be distributed by:    - Prepaid supermarket cards with funds loaded for charities and rehoming centres    - Click and collect services where possible (I make the payment and arrange for a charity/rehoming centre/foodbank manager to collect)    - Reimbursement of receipts sent to me up to a value we agree in advance    If you know of a foodbank  charity or rehoming centre thay would benefit from this  let them know of this campaign.    Email [email redacted]    They can make contact in advance and get allocated a budget for them to spend  they can purchase food and send over a receipt for reimbursement. This way it can speed up purchasing where it is really needed.    It can't help ALL charities so it will have to be a first come first served basis but more can be helped if more donations are pledged.    If we can raise £10 000 that would be at least 20 000 tins of food (basing that on a 6-tin pack being approximately £3.00 each).    We will look into buying large bags of dry food also which can be portioned out into smaller 500g or 1kg bags at food banks.    If you have a pet  or even if you don't  and you can spare £3 (equivalent of a 6 pack of food) that would be greatly appreciated. Anything more would be incredible.

If every person in the UK can donate something towards this cause  we can help the most vulnerable in our society.          Vulnerability is the degree to which a population  individual or organisation is unable to anticipate  cope with  resist and recover from the impacts of a health crisis such as Covid-19.    Children  pregnant women  elderly people  malnourished people  and people who are ill or uncompromised  are particularly vulnerable when a disaster strikes  and take a relatively high share of the disease burden associated with emergencies. Poverty – and its common consequences such as malnutrition  homelessness  poor housing and destitution – is a major contributor to vulnerability.    We’ve all seen people sleeping rough near where we live and work. Rough sleeping has more than doubled in London since 2010. During the past year alone  almost 9 000 people were seen sleeping out on London’s streets.    As travellers cancel flights  businesses ask workers to stay home  and stocks fall  a global health crisis becomes a global economic crisis. In any health crisis  our first concern is (and should be) with the health of those affected. The economic impacts have dramatic effects on the well-being of families and communities. For vulnerable families  lost income due to an outbreak can translate to spikes in poverty  missed meals for children  and reduced access to healthcare far beyond COVID-19.     Beyond the human tragedy  there is a direct economic impact from lives lost in an outbreak. Families and loved ones lose that income and their in-kind contributions to household income such as childcare.    Though less likely to pass away from COVID-19  many working age adults still fall ill and their families will feel the financial burden as they miss work for days or weeks.    As the crisis grows  so do the negative effects to peoples’ health and their financial well-being  but we can all do our part to help those affected. Here’s how making a direct donation to this COVID-19 fund can help:    LIVING EXPENSES    Hourly workers and people without paid sick leave are among the most vulnerable to the negative financial effects of the pandemic. With no way to cover expenses  workers like these will inevitably fall behind on rent and other fixed expenses. For these reasons  it’s important to get ahead of the crisis and start providing support to individuals like these.    FOOD  WATER  AND OTHER BASICS    Low-income households are already strained in good times but this new threat makes it even more important to provide immediate financial assistance to these households.    Welfare changes  soaring housing costs  and a shortage of affordable accommodation mean that more and more people are left with nowhere they can call home    Each member of this group has a specific project – such as providing emergency accommodation  longer-term support  or providing advice and assistance - that will benefit from your support. By giving your money to this fund  you can be confident that your donation will be distributed fairly and provide real help for people that are vulnerable in our society.

Based in the Southside of Glasgow  we are a Sikh Temple which has been established since the late 1960's. To establish this organisation  a small group of people got together and donated money to buy this property.  Our Sikh faith is based on three key principle's:-   1. remember one God    2. to earn an honest living and   3. to share a proportion of one's earning to a needy cause  no matter what race  religion or background they are from.    Since then  the Temple has been running on donations and still continues to run today. We are a non profit making organisation.   Over the years  our community has grown and our donations have grown.  However  our current property is in need of modernisation.  Our community feels that rather than spending money on an old building  it maybe better to take down the old building  and to erect a new larger building. Our current setting does not allow disabled access for the elderly and infirm.    We hold congregations every Sunday where people come to worship their faith  and meals are freshly made and served free of charge. We have teamed up with a Glasgow Charity and have been providing them excess food for some time to feed the homeless and needy.    We feel that if we have bigger premises  we can contribute even more to the wider community as a whole.    We could have a much larger impact on the wider community  with things such as larger donation of food to the homeless  establishment of Foodbanks for the disadvantaged  medical facilities to aid in the care of elderly  Education facilities for ages of children and adults  a Day Centre for the elderly to meet each other and to pass their time.    We have collected donations through the community and are still short of funding.   We are therefore seeking funding from the public for staged building of the new Sikh Gurdwara.    Our overall  project cost will be £2.2 million pounds  The amount which we are looking for would bridge the requirement for the building of the concrete foundations of this building.    Please see our photos of the existing building and proposed building.    Your support will help us to build a new building so we may serve the community    We would appreciate any donations  however big or small.  Thank you for your support.

Every year  thousands of people doesn’t have enough to eat and then to food banks in order to eat. The Dover food bank distributed over 3336 food parcels 2018-2019  36% were to children. Food banks see a spike in demand in the run up to Christmas as they do all they can to make sure people aren’t left hungry over the festive season. For this reason they need all the help they can get  to make sure nobody is turned away. Without donations and fundraisers from us who can give  this wouldn’t be possible. Even just a couple of pounds can make a real difference to people in crisis over Christmas  making sure that food banks are able to meet demand and provide a holiday treat for those in need.     From what I've seen  I can say that what the food bank does a great job  and the volunteers are the most wonderful people there is. They listen to you and wants what’s best for you! For these reasons I’m starting this GoFundMe  to make sure that the people who is in need of a food parcel can get one this Christmas  and a few treats too. It’s not about the amount you donate  it’s about giving  and even a couple of pounds can go a long way.    For example  1£ can buy 5 packs of spaghetti. 2£ can get 3 cans of tuna. 3£ buys 18 toilet rolls. So  as you can see even a small donation can help many people. How this works is; When the fundraiser is over  I will be withdrawing the money from the fundraiser  go to the shop and do a massive haul with it for the Dover Foodbank. The food will then be donated directly to the food bank along with any change left over. I’ll be bringing my camera with me to film the whole thing  and post pictures of the receipts and the haul. Afterwards the video of the haul will be put on YouTube."

I founded this community group back in 2017  because I wanted to give something to the community and I wanted to spread the love to and increase the appreciation of the art of crochet to people who cannot afford paying for workshops and lessons or are looking for a way to socialise with others on a regular basis.    Until March 2020 I held two weekly sessions and since then I host on-line sessions. During the sessions up to 20 people joined in from various backgrounds  the oldest member who joined on regular basis is 91 years  we have one member using a wheelchair ...    I decided to start a fundraising project because I my heart lies in this project. I want to continue on a free basis: online as long as possible  because it reaches a wider public and as soon as possible again 'in person'.     The funds will be used for:     • Subscription for an online video-conferencing platform.  • Enhancing my equipment. I would love to buy a document camera to make it easier to 'teach' various stitches.  •'Emergency' supply of yarn and crochet hooks for people in need.  • A 'free' cuppa for people in need.   • Venue hire costs.  • Printing costs for leaflets (so people can be reached who cannot use the Internet).  • Compensation for time and travel costs organising and running this project.     Why crochet in the community?    • It is an inexpensive way to be creative  you only need a hook  some yarn and some creative ideas.  • Crochet is a popular art  practised over centuries (the origins are unclear but very popular in Europe since the 19th century).  • Crocheting has various health benefits  like reducing stress  practising fine motor skills: with only knowing one stich you can already do a great mindfulness exercise.    .... and of course ....    • You can create something beautiful and unique for yourself  your friends or your loved ones.    Also crocheting can increase someone’s social network. In a social group people can meet  can talk  be inspired and inspire others  which can enhance social abilities.    I want to combine these positive effects of crochet in our Eltham community and I want to continue to host 2 sessions of 'Crochet 'n Natter' on a weekly basis.     The sessions are open for everyone who is interested in learning or improving a new skill (crochet)  or just want to socialize.     I want to use crochet as a medium to connect the community and offer a free opportunity for people to come together and be creative. The participants are welcome to come for any number of sessions.    I have run free sessions in the local community which have been very popular  and I am sure that there is interest and developing a project would be popular and advantageous to the community.     The in person session will give the Eltham community the chance to join in arts/ creative activities and brings the community together.     I also want to try taking part in local events as a community. Last year we participated in a local festival with creating and displaying a wall hanging  which is later donated to Eltham Library. We also had a Chrismas Sale and donated 25% of the proceeds to the local Foodbank. The rest we used to pay partly for our Christmas lunch.    During the sessions participants will be encouraged to share their (increased) skills with other participants and volunteer to help organise events/ sessions.    Your donation would really help me keeping and developing this beautiful project.     Thank you so much if you decide to support me. Your help is really appreciated.    Sylvia"

As I was alone in having to arrange both services I did not have time to grieve. My partner chose this time to be unfaithful and leave me with no support whatsoever. For the last 6 months I have found myself disolving into what can only be called a never ending nightmare circle of depression and ruin. I am trying to pull myself together and be positive but having increasing debts  depending on foodbanks and now facing eviction I can't see any light at the end of the tunnel. My only saving grace is my little dog. If it wasn't for her I would've given up long ago. I am under doctors supervision but my health has declined steadily along with everything else. I have worked all my life up till this all started but now at 60 years old I feel worthless. If anyone can please spare a little no matter how small it would be greatly appreciated. God bless you all."

One of these things is hunger. Hunger is also known as food insecurity.    Did you know :  - 8.4 million people in the UK are struggling to afford to eat. This is equivalent to the entire population of London.  - More than half of those suffering from food insecurity (4.7 million people) are classified as severely food insecure  sometimes going an entire day without any food at all.  - Although hunger is a severe issue  1.9 million tonnes of food is wasted by the food industry every year in the UK.     We are going to take a step to reduce the impact as we couldn't sit back and watch this.    Join us as we :  - Donate food to foodbanks.  - Donate money to charities who are currently working to tackle this issue.  - Support charities who are understaffed and facing this current crisis.

#PlanPositive,"Billericay, East of England, United Kingdom",https://www.gofundme.com/f/planpositive,0,1000,,2020-05-19,,,0,,"#PlanPositive    We have all been effected by Covid-19.  Nearly one in five under 15-year olds in the UK lives in a home where the parents can’t afford to put food on the table        The Why?  It's unsurprising that food bank usage in the UK is soaring.    In it's most recent annual analysis  The Trussell Trust  the UK's biggest network of food banks  revealed the number of supply packs it handed out had jumped 19% to a staggering 1.6 million compared to the previous year.    People have been placed in a world of uncertainty. 'When will my next pay cheque be?' 'What will happen to my work?' 'What about my children?' and the big one... 'How am I going to put food on the table?'    South East London is where I grew up  moved away from  and have now returned to work . It is also at the heart of this crisis. With demand up by 500% for the Southwark foodbank it feels only right that I try to give back to the community that helped shape my young life.    5 097 People were fed by Southwark foodbank between 2018 and 2019  996 additional people were helped by Southwark Foodbank last year. A 20% increase on the previous years figures.          The What.  I am looking to donate both food and money to the   Southwark Foodbank  c/o Pecan  121a Peckham High Street  Peckham  London SE15 5SE    The Foodbank provides three days nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to them in crisis.    A typical food parcel contains a minimum of 3 days of nutritionally balanced  non-perishable  tinned and dried foods .   A typical food parcel includes: breakfast cereal  soup  pasta  rice  pasta sauce  baked beans  tinned meat  tinned vegetables  instant mash  UHT milk  tea  coffee  sugar  tinned dessert and biscuits.     This obviously comes at a cost.     With the government and health officials urging people to stay at home as best as possible  this also puts a strain on the foodbank as it means they now have to deliver the parcels in person by car.          The How  With the guidance of the Southwark Foodbank  I will source and shop all items required and deliver to the food bank for them to distribute accordingly.  You can donate to this page and in return  I will purchase the items and add them to the donation.      How much should I donate?  As much as you can comfortably afford.      You can make a real difference to children  babies  families  and local communities by giving a small amount."

I hope everyone is well and staying safe.    As you may know  since December 2019 I have organised a monthly collection stall for York Foodbank as part of the Bishopthorpe and Rural West Branch of The Labour Party. Due to lockdown restrictions  I have cancelled all physical collection stalls  you can usually find me outside the CO-OP in Bishopthorpe  come rain or shine!     Instead  last month I decided to run a ""virtual"" collection stall instead - all the money raised from a crowdfunding page  like this  went towards purchasing specific food items York Foodbank desperately needed. I purchased the food from a local wholesalers (Miller Foods) and had it delivered directly to the Foodbank depot in Clifton Moor.     Last month's virtual collection was a huge success - raising over £600 which was turned into 0.5.tonnes of food delivered directly to York Foodbank.    The need for food banks is greater now than ever before as The Trussell Trust reports a soaring 81% increase for emergency food parcels from food banks in its network during the last two weeks of March 2020  compared to the same period in 2019 – including a 122% rise in parcels given to children  as the coronavirus pandemic continues to unfold.

"Equipment upgrade needed to make protective masks","Eastbourne, South East England, United Kingdom",https://www.gofundme.com/f/upgrade-equipment-needed-to-make-masks,0,350,,2020-05-08,,,0,,"I am a 50yr old single mum to two teenagers who was made redundant end of last year  then just as I landed my perfect job the lockdown was enforced and the position was no longer available.  Finding myself with time on my hands I had started to make reusable and washable face masks when a friend approached me and asked me to supply his local business with 150 of my handmade washable face masks for their key workers to protect themselves whilst working.       After I posted a quick cheeky snap of myself wearing a mask onto social media I started to get requests from people who wanted to purchase them for themselves. I designed and created some gothic inspired designs and demand for them shot up even further  with new orders coming in every hour. The gothic range has proved to be very popular  and new fabrics are being eagerly awaited to create more designs.          Each face mask is made of 6 pieces of fabric  each of which is handcut individually by myself from new clean polycotton fabric. They are 3 layers each with a pocket to add a filter if you so wish  and all have a bendable nose section to allow the mask to fit snuggly over the bridge of the wearers nose. They are finished off with elastic loops which go around the ears. Each mask is then packaged into compostable/recyclable clear poly bags to keep them clean  ready for dispatch.   With a background in community and charity I wanted to make my masks available to families who may not be able to afford to purchase them  but at the same time my venture needs to cover its own costs too. So after some thought as to how I can support others who are less fortunate whist still covering my overheads I decided to donate a face mask to my local Foodbank for every 5 masks I sell. Thus my overheads are covered yet I am still giving back to the community at the same time.    I love creating  and love sewing these masks  however my sewing machine is old and has already broken down once causing a 6 day delay on production while I waited for replacement parts. This fundraiser has been set up as I would like to purchase a new more reliable sewing machine that not only sews  but also embroiders  so I can create more bespoke and custom items that will have my own embroidered designs on them.    Your support is much valued and appreciated  and I believe in paying things forward. So if I successfully hit my target I will make 25 face masks for my local Foodbank so they can distribute them to the families who need their help at this trying time. I will continue     If you have any questions then please feel free to ask  I am always happy to help.    Kind Regards & stay safe  Lucie          'Without people  you are nothing' - Joe Strummer  The Clash."

WE ALL HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AND LIFT EACH OTHER UP""     Quote: Hilary Clinton    Home-Start has a 47-year history of helping families most in need in our communities. As the coronavirus pandemic takes hold  we remain as committed as ever to supporting parents – in their homes and communities – in the critical early years of childhood. Our work builds parental confidence and resilience  enhances attachment  and reduces community isolation. This transforms children’s lives in terms of their health and wellbeing and their emotional  social and educational development.    We are seeing social distancing and isolation placing enormous strain on families. Families with particular pressures such as poor mental health  illness and low wages are being hit hard by the crisis. Home-Starts NEA have moved fast to provide support for these and other families affected. We have moved essential support services on-line to stay connected with families. our staff and volunteers are playing an important part in local community response efforts which include – delivering essential supplies and linking families into local resources such as Foodbanks  meals  and public health services.    In the coming weeks and months we will work harder than ever to find ways to make sure families continue to have the support they need. So much is changing so rapidly right now  but one fact remains – around 2000 babies are born each day in the UK. The practical and emotional demands of parenthood are challenging enough in normal times but the current pandemic adds so many additional layers of anxiety  uncertainty and isolation.    The next few months are going to change our communities for years to come. As we emerge from the current crisis  Home-Start volunteers will play a key part in the wider effort needed to bring families and communities together again.    Like many others  one of our biggest challenges will be securing the income we need to continue this vital work. Local Home-Starts are on the frontline of support yet are already facing substantial financial difficulties. We are taking decisive action wherever we can to reduce our costs without jeopardising the essential services which families depend on us to provide. But with shops closing  fundraising events being cancelled and longer term grant funding at risk  many of our local services will face a significant drop voluntary income in the next few months.    We are grateful for the help of all our friends through this crisis. To come through it strong and be there for families both now and into the future we need you and all our supporters to stay connected with us  invest in our work as generously as you’re able  and  more than ever before  to spread the word – to your colleagues  friends and wider networks. Please believe it  your support and every action you take for us will make a difference.    Thank You all for your continued support. We appreciate this so much.      From All at Home Start NEA"

But it’s still nice to be nice  so I thought I’d set this little Go Fund me page up to hopefully put a big smile on a little girls face.   Quite simply Elsie would love a Tortoise called Ernie - that should be enough for anyone to donate (even if just £1!) as just imagine her little face when her dreams come true! But please read below if you need more reason to donate  thank you Elsie and her mum Lizzie have made me lol every day since I stumbled across them on Instagram (you must follow if you don’t already: Shootitmommaphoto) Lizzie is a single mum  self employed Photographer without work currently (as I know a lot of people are right now) and has been dedicating so much of her spare time to making the rest of us smile. Lizzie has raised £750 by herself (and counting!) for Rutland Foodbank by taking lockdown photos of the residence of Oakham as she walks/bikes past their homes on her walk. The photos are incredible and all the proceeds went to the above charity. They’ve also been making the most AWESOME cover music videos to keep us all entertained during lockdown. Check them out by the way if you haven’t already!     She has put so much time into making lots of us smile - I’ve never met Lizzie in person  I just think it would be just lovely it if we could return the favour.    Her daughter Elsie has her heart on buying a Tortoise and naming him Ernie. Let’s make this happen.   Thank you in advance!    x"

As we narrate this story  we have but some food left in our food bank. Food as we all know is one of the most important commodities of life  without it there is no survival. For a while now there has been a shortage of food supply in our Orphanages due to some financial constraints which regrettably is now beyond control. We have thousands of orphanages globally lingering around hope for survival. Before now our food bank has been sponsored and supported by individuals  organizations and anonymous donors who seem to have brought respite and succor from the little they had. We are all aware of what it is to feel hungry or impoverished for a day not to talk of children. We have been emboldened by the love  kindness and support of people who shared in our dreams and intervention which necessitated our donation of food  relief materials and other utilities.     People are filling up their trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of the pandemic - and foodbanks up and down the country are running out of food. Children in the Orphanages are crying out to you who have more than enough to feed to help them during this shutdown. They need your love and support at this critical stage that we are in because we are dealing with a twin war Corona Virus/Hunger Pandemic.     As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock-on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero-hours workers getting zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six-week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process)  More and more as we progress we find ourselves on the brink of total collapse.     We are here hoping against all hopes that our children feed at least two (2) meals a day or more. Our plea and intervention  therefore  is for people to share in our project goal to provide food and necessities to reduce the scourge globally.     We don't know when COVID- 19 will stop and there is no gainsaying that the impact of the pandemic has destroyed global economies and would get worst if we don't conquer the hunger rampaging orphanages and the less privileged globally. Developed countries have brought palliatives to their citizens but what about Africa where these twin war (Corona Virus/Hunger Pandermic) have permeated the continent. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks. Therefore this is a call for action     All the monies raised will go directly to SINABELAS FOUNDATION who will use it to support all orphanages in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger.     Every donation made is worthwhile and will go along way in reducing these menace.     If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media will help! Thank you for lending a hand to humanity."

Having profited a paltry £42 million pounds in the last financial year  the club  having been deprived of matchday revenue for almost a full three weeks now  seek to furlough it's non-playing staff and resort to using public funds to pay them  such is the degree of the club's financial struggles.     Liverpool join other poor Premier League clubs like Tottenham Hotspurs (8th richest football club in the world  Levy £3m bonus) and Mike Ashley's Newcastle United in the dole queue.    Meanwhile  NHS workers are bathing in money  food and equipment  having been riding the gravy train throughout austerity.

Today when we speak about business questions  we ask ourselves: 'what would Shankly do?' Doubt he'd have said let the taxpayer pay some wages when you've just made £42m profit.

"Food For Families in Saffron Walden","Saffron Walden, East of England, United Kingdom",https://www.gofundme.com/f/1ywzn4pho0,0,3000,,2020-04-04,,,0,,"Hope Community Hub was set up to help the vulnerable in our community. In partnership with TLG 'Make Lunch'  this Easter we were due to run a lunch club for families in need of help over the holiday period. As we are no longer able to run the 'Make Lunch' club  TLG have very kindly donated £200 to help us support local families with food parcels instead. Whilst we are grateful for their donation  local primary schools have told us that they have 30 families in need of help. I don't know about you  but £200 sounds more like a reasonable amount to help one family over Easter than 30! Let's pull together as a community to help families in need. Help us to help these families with food parcels. There is enough anxiety at the moment about Cronovirus; worrying about our families' health  our health  our jobs  families shouldn't need to be worrying about how they can feed themselves as well. I'm going to suggest a target of £3 000. That's £100 of food per family. We are working in partnership with Saffron Walden foodbank and any money raised in addition will be donated to them."
