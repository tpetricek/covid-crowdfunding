I’m married to john and have 5 beautiful children.   A few years ago john was working as a helicopter pilot. A career he had wanted since he was a child and absolutely adored.    But then he got sick. He struggled for a long time before doctors figured out he had several auto immune diseases all at once. He struggles every day with pain  sickness  and insomnia. He takes morphine every day and has done for years  with really debilitating side effects because the medical system can’t help him.   He was made redundant from his beloved job and eventually we lost our house to the bank as we couldn’t keep up with the mortgage. This is something he really struggles to accept. Since then we have gone from one disaster to another. We rent a house at the moment that the landlord wants us to move out so they can use it for something else but we have nowhere to go. The council can’t help us. No private landlord will help because john is not working and we cannot afford to get anywhere ourselves.     It’s really hard to watch our kids miss out on so much in their childhood. Some of them are too young to remember the amazing  fun  hardworking dad they had. Now they see him sick and weak and they see all the things they miss out on because we cannot afford it or because he is too ill to take part in it. It’s hard to hide our tears when we know there’s something they want but we can’t give it to them. Or hide our upset when we have to go to the food bank or sell some of our things to give them a birthday present or afford their homeschooling needs.   It’s very humbling to have to hold your hands up and admit you need help. For john to not be able to provide for his family is devastating. He is not able to admit we need help but I as a wife and mother know that humbling ourselves and asking for help is the only option left open to us.     Johns own doctors have told us about medication they believe will really help him and get him off the morphine. But they cannot prescribe this medication on the NHS and unfortunately we cannot afford to buy it privately. John was due to have an operation in January 2020 but it was postponed due to COViD and he is still waiting. He could get this operation in a matter of weeks privately but we cannot afford to pay for it. There are many things we could do to help him get better and get back to work but we cannot afford it. It’s extremely heartbreaking to know there is help right in front of us but we cannot take advantage of it because we don’t have enough money.     We have experienced people’s kindness throughout this process. We feel so ashamed that we have not been able to repay that kindness and to have to ask for more help but that’s exactly what I’m doing. I need my husband back. My kids need their father back and we need some stability in our lives again  we need a forever home.   If you could please help in anyway I would be so so grateful. You have no idea how much your help could change our lives. Please help me get my husband well again and not suffer so much everyday. Please me give my babies a forever home and a dad who is well enough to be the dad he always wanted to be.     Thank you for any help you can give and We would be so grateful for any prayers you could offer for our family. Xx    Edit:  Thank you all so much for your donations. It’s incredibly overwhelming to experience all your generosity and kindness. And thank you also to the people who have personally sent donations directly to us  Mavis & Chris and Marion O’Reilly.   We are totally humbled by your love and kindness. Thank you all xxxx",False

Can you believe it?    In that time  we have fed more than 2500 families across Reading and the surrounding areas.    It started as a small venture but as the word got out  it became more and more apparent that there was a huge grey area in the community regarding the support of families who have their lives turned on it’s head over night.    Free Meals  Full Hearts is NOT designed to help the same families on a week in  week out basis. I created the group to support those who maybe too proud or embarrassed to reach out for help or go to a food bank. It was created for families who may have faced redundancy or who are struggling on furlough… it’s for those without a support network around them who needs a little short term support.    I have been overwhelmed with the support in the last 12 months. The newspaper articles and TV appearances has helped raise a huge amount of awareness. And I’m overwhelmingly flattered to have received my Pride of Britain AND Pride of Reading nominations- thank you to everyone who has voted!    The success of this group purely comes down to both the physical donation of food but also the financial support provided by this Go Fund Me page. I would not be able to do what I do without this so thank you in anticipation for your support    All the money raised is used within this group and is withdrawn for food  personal hygiene products and pet products. Once purchased  the donation is delivered with confidence to the family           ",False

Chrissy will be heading a team of volunteers from the AP Foundation CIO  to take part in the 5km Run-through Lee Valley Velopark on Saturday 23rd October 2021. Her brave efforts will help raise money for the AP Foundation ""Made in London"" bus project. Made in LONDON is a multi-media training and intervention project delivered into the community on board a purpose-built double-decker bus  to help disadvantaged young people  and those at risk of exclusion from school  out of education  employment or training and at risk of offending  to change their lives for the better and reduce anti-social behaviour. The bus will travel into the heart of the community so that we can attract those who need us most and working alongside local Youth Offending Teams  Pupil Referral Units  Social Services  Police  Schools and Community services  we will make a difference. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause  which means so much to us all. Anyone wishing to take part in the run or willing to offer support please contact www.apfoundation.co.uk Help us by sharing on social media. Thank you.   1. The bus will function as a radio station. They will travel to different areas of London/ UK with a different artist every month performing in that area. Radio broadcast will be on radio frequency  and online platforms (Youtube  Instagram  FB live etc) 2. When the bus is not being used as a radio station  it will be used by underprivileged youths as a recording studio  to record their potential music and accompanying videos. 3. Programs will be offered in music production and recording that teens can sign up to attend online before the actual recording offers to begin. 4. A competition for best recording and music video can be offered at the end of the month with either monetary or product giveaway from sponsors  plus the opportunity to perform live on the radio and exposure to the radio’s listeners. 5. As well as performances from artists bringing light to the cause  our APF mentors will also have their own podcast and talk show. They would take calls from underprivileged kids or gang members  other ex-offenders and the like and give real-life advice based on their experiences helping give mentorship not only on a one-to-one basis but also that can be accessed online for many others that may need the same advice. 6. On radio off days  the bus can be used as a traveling food bank to bring food from supermarket sell-by produce to people who need it the most. We can also provide cups of tea or coffee to those in need of a hot drink and some company to ease the loneliness the Covid lockdown has brought to many. Volunteers for this would be from the foundation as a rehabilitation project for ex-offenders to give back to the community.       ",False

I have previously worked for Foodbank as a volunteer during the pandemic helping homeless people  migrants  and other vulnerable people.    Situation?    I have always worked and paid my living expenses when I had a student visa. However  because of the hostile environment policy and UK’s draconian immigration system  I do not have permission to work  and I have no recourse to public funds (NRPF)  meaning that I have no access to housing support and benefits. As a result  I have been couch surfing and relying on the kindness of friends to stop me from being street homeless. I am also struggling with prediabetes and need proper nutrition and diet to avoid my situation getting worse.    What’s the plan?

Last 2 years was really difficult for me i been thru so much problems and struggling and because of that I get in really big debs with bills and people. My wifi been cut and my phone either I had days when I couldn't afford a food and was getting help from food banks but the food was already expired so I wasn't able give it for kids. I'm using one app when people give free food sometimes but I couldn't always get it as I'm not driving and the food need to be pick up by myself. Boys dad is not really much in our life he don't even have time to come and see his son and they miss him so much and keep asking when he will finally come and girls dad want to prison and he left me with everything on my own. My life is a hell at the moment as I can't afford even to get a food for kids and that's making me feel like the worse mum ever. Aalia my little princess have health problems. She start everything late like rolling from belly to back  sitting  crawling and now she's 18 months and still doesn't walk as her muscles are too weak and she will need physiotherapy and appointments with different doctors and this will cost me a lot. Ian have ADHD what make his life more difficult as not many people understand him and saying that he's very naughty child what makes him often upset but really he's the sweetest child I ever met he have so much love inside his little heart he will give me hugs and kisses like no other child will do. Always when I'm sad or he see me crying he always gonna come to me hug me wipe my tears and said ""don't cry mummy i love you"" and this words makes me keep going and fighting everyday because I know I have my children to live for. Without them I would be probably dead right now. I was going thru deep depression and sometimes I feel like I don't deserve to be a mum as my children deserve everything what's the best for them and atm I can't give them much because I'm a bit financially struggling Im not able to afford anything and this kill me everyday special when they asking me if I can buy them something they really want. If I could back to work I would do it but atm that's not possible as my little one is just 3 months old and I don't have any family or much friends here. I wish I could back to Poland to my parents but I can't even afford to do my girls passports as everyday I'm trying to manage to get some food or stuff for kids . I love my kids so much from bottom of my heart and I could die for them if I will have to and I feel very bad and shy to ask for help but atm that's the only option I have so if you can help me even little bit I would really much appreciate it at this will let me finally live without stressing everyday that someone will knock to my door or i that my kids will have no food in the fridge. Thank you so much for reading and understanding my situation and for any help what will change my and my 4 little munchkins lifes for better ❤️ God bless you ❤️ ",True
" High court trial fund against police & government","Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.gofundme.com/f/high-court-trial-fund-against-police-government,0,100000,,2021-09-06,,,0,,"Hi my names William Thompson. I stand accused in the high court in Glasgow of.   Aggressive Serious Organised Crime and Millions of Pounds of Cannabis Cultivation throughout Scotland.     I have been accused by a business partner of this crime. Even though my business partner and his family have be questioned  on this kind of crime several times before. The Crown have made it clear that it would be easier to get a conviction  with myself as my business partner is an ex doctor. And is a leading figure in the British Muslim Community. He and his family are also SNP Supporters  and campaign endlessly throughout the Scottish Muslim Community to keep their votes strong. They have been known to give very large Donations to the SNP party. His links in the English Muslim Community is very well known and he was a big contributor to aid an MSP into the Justice Ministry Job. The minister is now in another position in the Scottish Government head Table. The Crown Believe it would cause Race Hate and Devision To take this Family to Court. This Asian Family Have walked Free from every Court Case they Have Stood Trial for. And Every Scottish or No Muslim Business Associate have been convicted for their Crimes.     Police Scotland and the Scottish Government have spent millions of pounds of tax’s payers money to take me to court. They have wrote endless amounts of blank cheques to try frame me for this crime. They have involved U.K. and European Agencies.     The Corruption in the Scottish Legal System is Rife. And No one could Face A fair trial if you go head to head with the system.     Due to the fact I can not get a fair trial. I have had to sack my QC and Legal Team and now have to Defend Myself in the High Court In Glasgow.     The costs to defend yourself is unbelievable and as I am taking on the system with no QC or Legal Team. I do not get Legal Aid.     The Information and The Defences Costs are mounting up day by day. As for every professional opinion they put forward. I have to get another opinion to counterbalance their evidence.     Due to this trial I have lost my properties. My land. My dignity and my life. I am forced to live in a homeless shelter and take food from food banks. I have to sign on at a police office and have to stick to their rules. I am an untried human being. Being forced to do things their way. And be treated like a convicted person with no rights what so ever.    During my time on high court bail. I have studied the law and laws of the land. I have started assisting other people that have similar problems. I have started to help people to understand their rights as a human being. I have been educating the difference between Common Law and Criminal Law. THESE COURTS AND POLICE. AND GOVERNMENT THRIVE ON PEOPLE NOT KNOWING THE LAW.       I recommend to every single person out there not to trust your lawyers or courts and especially the Police and Government. These people do not have your interest in mind.     Everyone needs to open their eyes. You are living inside an invisible prison. YOU JUST CANT SEE THE BARS.     HELP ME FIGHT THE SYSTEM.   HELP ME CHANGE THE LAWS.   HELP ME MAKE IT LAW THAT THESE PEOPLE CAN NEVER DO THIS AGAIN     IN ORDER FOR ME TO FIGHT FOR MY RIGHTS AND YOUR RIGHTS. I NEED TO PAY FOR PROFESSIONAL REPORTS AND COUNTER INFORMATION TO CHANGE THE LAWS.     PLEASE HELP ME FIGHT THE STSTEM.     IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE LAW OR YOU FEEL YOU CANT TRUST YOUR LAWYER. LET US KNOW. IF WE CAN HELP WE WILL     WE ARE SETTING UP AN ADVICE SERVICE. THAT WORKS OUTSIDE THE LAW SOCIETY AND THE COURTS FRAMEWORK.     WE WILL WIN OUR RIGHTS BACK.       ",True

This half term  however  and over this coming Christmas  we truly need your help to feed the new wave of people and pets from across London who are in crisis and will be coming through our doors this winter at Kath's Place  50 Friendly Street  Deptford SE8 4DR.    But this October millions will lose £1040 through the cut to #UniversalCredit people many in low paid work & most already on the breadline not helped by the increasing high cost of rent & rising energy -transport costs .Can you imagine losing up to 20%plus of your monthly income? That is the reality for so many people in the present crisis. Rents are so high in our area that people in work do not have enough cash to pay the rent and  probably for the first time in their lives  are having to trade a visit to their local coffee shop for a visit to the We Care Food Bank and Food Pantry for help  advice  support and solidarity. Embarrased and even ashamed  but even more desperate and distraught that their kids are going hungry  mums tell us that they can go days without food  and  on average  it takes people at least a week of going hungry before they finally come through our doors and ask for help. We really do need your donation this Christmas GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw .

The fall off in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that we have had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased our costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries.

It’s crazy how the pandemic we currently living in has caused all kinds of financial difficulties situations and families have had no choice but to turn to the food banks for help and assistance. I know that raising money will help the food bank buy essential food. It saddens me to see how the numbers have doubled as more people are being impacted by COVID-19 with job losses and furlough leaving families struggling to find money to buy enough food. We have all seen the headlines regarding school meals but it's easy to forget for a lot of these children that is the only balanced meal they will get. In the first six months of the pandemic  some food banks in the United Kingdom gave out a staggering 1.2 million emergency food parcels. That’s one food parcel every 13 seconds  and 2 600 of these went to children every day on average. I decided to walk 2021 km and hopefully get this achieved within 10 months. So if you see me walking please give me a cheer and some motivational comments.

Now  we need your support more than ever.    Due to massive demand and the end of the lease on our current Warehouse we are moving to a brand new home that will help us increase our capacity and speed up our operations  helping us to continue to put food donated by the community straight into the hands of those who need it.     This is an exciting chapter in Canterbury Food Bank’s history  and a brilliant opportunity for us to grow and change in response to new challenges. But it is also an expensive chapter; our previous premises were occupied on a peppercorn lease of £10 a month  so by paying the market rate for a suitable property our rental costs have been multiplied 133 times.     We are asking our community to help us raise a year of rent - £16 000 - up front so that all other funds can be used to buy and deliver food. Please donate and share this appeal widely to secure the future of the Food Bank as a key charity in the district.     PRESS RELEASE -    Canterbury Food Bank today launched a campaign to help pay for its new building - after its rent multiplied 133 times.     The charity is moving to another warehouse  specially converted to suit its needs  because the lease on its current premises has come to an end.    CFB had been paying a peppercorn rent of £10 a month for the old building  but will now have to pay market rate of £16 000 a year.     Its Raise the Rent campaign aims to cover the rental costs so that all other funds can be used to buy and deliver food. The new  bigger warehouse  near Whitstable  secures the future of CFB as a key charity in the district.     Demand in the past 12 months has at times more than trebled year-on-year and in December it provided enough food to make more than 10 000 meals.     The economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 crisis  and the uncertainty of Brexit  are the main reasons behind the spike.    The charity has signed a five-year lease on the 3 780 square foot  two storey warehouse  which will be used to store donations of food and as an office.     CFB chair Martin Ward said: “We’re pleased and relieved to have secured our long-term future at a time when our services have never seen such high demand.     “It has become clear over the past year that  even more than ever  a backstop is needed to help those who can not afford food.     “We are that backstop and it is our intention to remain so for as long as we are required.     “These are difficult times for many people and we ask the public to help us support those most in need.”    CFB provides emergency three-day food parcels to individuals and families in financial need across Canterbury  Whitstable  Herne Bay and surrounding villages.    It has donation baskets in all leading supermarkets including Sainsbury’s  Tesco  Asda and Morrisons  where people can leave dried or tinned food items. ",False

My name is Hope and I have been a Hackney resident for almost six years. I feel very fortunate to live in such a brilliant area  and want to give something back.    Covid-19 has unfortunately left many in crisis  and the need for support from the community has been higher than ever.     In 2020  Hackney Foodbank reported that 19 400 households needed their support. This is a 263% increase from 2018.     The Government are currently offering an uplift in Universal Credit of £20 per week. However  they plan to stop this at the end of March. This has the potential to drive a further one million people to foodbanks across the UK.    Like everyone else  the majority of my last year has been spent on daily walks - now I want to make those steps count.     To raise money for my local foodbank  and awareness of the upcoming cuts in Universal Credit  I will be walking  running and cycling 20km a day for 20 days starting on Friday 25th March. This works out as 400km in distance  or around 4.5hours of walking a day.    My target is £400  £1 per km and I would love for you to sponsor me!     Any amount will be appreciated  even £5 will go a long way to making a difference in someone's life!     Thank you!",False

Having had a mental breakdown and suicide attempt I was struggling mentally and financially. I went to the food bank and while there I had a mini breakdown. This is when I met [Zink Advice Worker] Julie. Julie was extremely easy to talk to and quickly gained my trust to be able to talk to her. She helped me sort through piles of paperwork  speaking to people about bills and debts  getting me to speak to the right people to help me and being there when I just needed to talk. Since September I have been diagnosed with autism and the biggest problem I had was a debt to my landlord of over £4000 for which they had an eviction order. Julie was instrumental in helping me get a court hearing where the eviction was suspended. Julie's knowledge was brilliant and made we aware of funds/benefits available to me and because of this in under nine months I have been able to pay off (through myself and funds) the entire arrears and have the eviction set aside. For the first few months I was also reliant on the food bank side while my money git sorted.  I cannot thank Julie (and Zink and high peak food bank) enough for the last nine months. Without her and them I certainly wouldn't be in as good a position as I am now - mentally  financially and emotionally.   I want to give back and as I am not working I don't have the means to give what I want.   This is my thank you.

We know that for many families  individuals  and businesses that things are extremely tough just now  but for those who may be able to donate a couple of pounds  then we would be hugely grateful for your support that will allow us to help those most in need.    People can donate directly via this gofundme appeal page  or if you prefer  we can accept donations of non perishable food items directly at the centre Monday to Friday 10am-5pm.    Over the last 12 months your support and wonderful donations have not only helped to sustain our organisation  but it's helped a tremendous amount of families and individuals in their greatest hour of need  and your support really has made a massive impact on their lives.    Our support project  which the foodbank is one stand of  is helping not only people in Garthdee  but 14 other communities in Aberdeen south  while we are helping many organisations to support their clients too. The need is real  the need is genuine  and every penny of your support sustains and supports.    No matter how small your donation may be  whether it's one pound  or one tin of food  it's hugely appreciated and makes a difference and we are hugely grateful  as are those benefitting from your generosity.     Thank you for all of the support during 2020  it's been amazing  and now in 2021 we strive to ensure no one slips through the net with your support.  THANK YOU FROM TEAM INCHGARTH.        ",False

The project is being run out of St Edmund’s church hall on Lanehouse Rocks Road in Weymouth. Donations of non-perishable food items and household items are welcome between 10:30am and 12:30pm on Thursdays.    However  because of changeable COVID restrictions on people moving from place to place  we're also launching a crowdfunding campaign to allow us to buy additional essential food and non-food items on your behalf.    Your donation is really important to someone who is in desperate need of emergency food during this unprecedented crisis. Your help is really appreciated. Thank you.",False

This support started when there was no halal food support in the local area of Sharrow and Netheredge and people were struggling to buy basic food for themselves. Due to a gap in the area and a desperate need TSY collaborated with few others to collectively reach out to the most vulnerable including single parents  elderly  self isolating and hardship such as loss of income. All our work is voluntary and since March kind donations from local community has assisted us in making sure no one struggled alone. We are running low on cash donations to purchase food to continue this vital support and are reaching out to anyone who can support us by using this link and donating whatever little they can towards the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank project. Due to the level of need and referrals coming in since the start of this halal foodbank  we have called it Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank to avoid any barriers to any non-muslim vulnerable that maybe in need of this support.

The recent announcement of Tier 4 has further hit us with events we had already prepared for stock having been bought and cashflow depleted being cancelled with no notice or very little notice. Rather than let good food go to waste we are working with The Street team Tunbridge Wells & Nourish Community Foodbank to supply cooked food to homeless people in Tunbridge Wells including Christmas Day and to raise vital funds for Nourish moving forwards  this will also enable us to cover some costs of running our business to keep it alive while supporting those in need.     We plan to use our contacts within the food trade to ensure that trade prices are achieved rather than paying high street costs We have set this page up to help with covering some the costs of cooking the food  anything above that will be donated.    We’d like to thank the good people of Tunbridge Wells for suggesting we set up a page and pledging to support us moving forward.    Merry Christmas one and all  whilst it’s a strange one this year try to do your bit if you can. ",False

The Project /Building Purley Masjid​    Purley Masjid is a modern Islamic community centre in a suburb of South London  Purley. It was established in 2015 after fund raising to accommodate the needs of the local Muslim community.    Ma Sha’ Allah  the Masjid is now trying to cope with the demand and has to overcome many challenges to support the Muslim and also non-Muslim community. Here are just a few of examples of the issues:     We have one main hall which accommodates only 200 people for an average Jumu’ah congregation of over 400.      People often have to wait outside in the forecourt for the second Jamaat     Current facilities for ladies accommodates around 30  whereas the demand is known to be in excess of 150. This is severely restricting our ability to meet current demand for women     Our lectures  Fitness Classes  Mother and Toddlers group  daily iftaris in Ramadhan and seniors meet up sessions all take place on the same carpeted area on which we pray. This is not ideal and as we are effectively operating out of one hall  it means that we can only have one activity happening at any given time     The Food Bank only has enough space for a shelf rack to store food. It caters for anyone in need in the Purley community  Muslim and non-Muslim alike        By the Grace of Allah swt we have embarked on the Building Purley Masjid project that will cater for the needs of the community. The project will result in a new Masjid on the current Purley Masjid site and will be a modern  purpose built building for the community spanning 6 floors that will include:     Two male prayer halls with a combined capacity of 500     A ladies prayer hall with capacity of over 200 and crèche facilities      A multi purpose hall     A dedicated lecture/events hall (we held over 100 last year)  which can accommodate 100 people     Improved facilities for our already existing Youth Activities  Mother and Toddlers Group and Seniors Group     Separate classrooms for our Madrasah classes      More space for our weekly Food Bank  ​​    We already have all these activities running at Purley Masjid but are struggling to meet demands and keep up the excellent level of service we provide.",False

We want to provide a place where people who love to cook  but who are unable to do so because of their housing situation  can enjoy cooking healthy balanced meals for themselves and others  which our volunteers can deliver to our clients who are in crisis  many of whom have very specific dietary requirements. Any surplus food will be sold in our community cafe to help fund our work.

Update: 19th January  2021 I've been interviewed by The Independent about the catastrophic consequences of the upcoming Universal Credit cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/b1789040.html      .  .  .        My original message: 30th August  2019    This is incredibly difficult for me to write  but I need to ask my friends  acquaintances and perhaps even some people whom I don’t know  to help me get through the next few months.    I am a domestic abusive survivor struggling to meet essential living costs and the situation is going to escalate rapidly because my employer is deducting more than 25% of my pay from September onwards  to recover two overpayments they made in error for a really long time  without me or payroll noticing.    I’m already on a low income and have been trying to find a more stable job. Until now I’ve been working two jobs  but the temporary one is coming to an end and I will only have my permanent part-time job – where they have persistently tried to dismiss me on health grounds so aside from the overpayment recovery  I just can’t hold on there for much longer.    Whenever I do give my notice or get dismissed  they’ll take the entirety of my final month’s pay.    I live alone but the person I used to cohabit with left substantial utility bill debts at our home that I didn’t become aware of until later  since they lied about having cleared balances. There’s not enough space to move another person in  and I can’t move out right now for financial and contractual reasons.    Because of an active police investigation for rape and domestic abuse that I can’t go into  I’ve already borrowed money for unexpected costs like home security  numerous phone calls to charities and agencies offering professional advice  and private therapy which unfortunately I had to quit.    My chronically poor health has dramatically worsened – I’ve been to a&e twice in the past fortnight because of a kidney infection that didn’t respond to treatment and I had to pawn things to pay for my ongoing prescriptions  but there’s not much of value left for me to sell.    I need to wear glasses but have been doing without for several months since they broke; I’m doing without a lot of things. One of my cats needs dental surgery soon but this isn’t going to be possible.    I earn slightly too much to claim benefits or get free prescriptions and despite years of hospital referrals  I am still fighting for a diagnosis to explain my physical health problems so I’m not currently eligible for any support that could be claimed.    Unfortunately I’m estranged from my parents and I don’t have regular contact with any other family.    I don’t have savings and I wouldn’t realistically be able to repay any further money borrowed.    Up to this point I’ve managed to keep on top of the rent and buy cat food but I have now begun going without my own food  even before overpayment recovery has started. I’m hoping to access a food bank next week but the period I can use them for will be limited.    It’s hard to put a figure on how much help I should ask for  since the only real solution is me finding a job where they’re not actively trying to dismiss me for my chronic health problems  but I am hopeful that if I can just get straight with the money I already owe and raise a couple of months’ living expenses to buy myself time whilst finding a better job  then I can make things work.

Since we were founded 10 months ago  we have continued to support local schools and their families with vital food packages. This is something that is really important to us as we have come to realise how many people are struggling in the county and have been shocked by it. We have built a fantastic relationship with local schools and knowing we are doing something for these young people and their families is very rewarding. As well as schools we have provided food packages to the Northamptonshire community mental health team  'leaving care': an organisation for individuals who are leaving the care system  HM probation services  local community groups as well as many families or vulnerable individuals who have reached out for support.     The McCarthy-Dixon foundation started initially as an emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a food bank and food delivery service. We have quickly broadened our services after realising the scope of both poverty and hardship in the local area. The community has always been at the heart of what we do and this means we will change and adapt to what the community needs.",False

Every week we take the money you have kindly donated to a cash and carry and buy  in bulk  what the four food banks we are working with have told us they desperately need. (See pics below). This is complemented by a weekly visit to the Felix Project where we load up with fresh fruit  veg  meat  eggs and cheese. All of this is delivered to community kitchens who cook up meals for those most in need in W10.    We are currently working with The Dalgarno Trust   Bay 20   The Space and The Tabernacle . All four of these charities provide meals  bags of shopping and many other support services to those experiencing food poverty in W10. Kensington and Chelsea boasts some of the highest net worth inhabitants but also has many pockets of severe deprivation – North Kensington is one of the deepest. A sobering fact to note is that 31.6% of children in this borough live in poverty.    Food banks we are working alongside unanimously concur that the demand for aid has tripled this year since the pandemic began. Help is needed more than ever. Every time we make a drop  the relief and joy the charities express is palpable and sums up how desperate the situation is.    All the money donated will be used to supply fruit  veg and essentials to those in need in North Kensington. Your financial donations will go entirely towards funding this food relief project. All staff  including Rima  Amanda  Maryam and the admin  safeguarding and marketing support team are volunteers.     Please share this page with anyone who might be interested in helping and please donate if you would like to help. A regular donation would make a huge difference  as food poverty is not going to go away.    Thank you for your invaluable support.    Rima  Maryam  Amanda and team.    How to contact us:  Email: [email redacted]  Instagram: stjohnscafe    Call Rima: 07891 078 647    Or Amanda 07956 282 858    How it started: In March when the pandemic closed the doors of Rima’s Café at the Playground Theatre  she and her son Mars created a GoFundMe page to raise money for a Covid19 food relief campaign.

We are continuing to support these families in term time and the holidays.     £50 raised will be able to feed 25 young people    £100 raised will be able to feed 50 young people    £1000 raised will be able to feed 500 young people     There is power in our community. Join us.        Food provision through schools and youth clubs play an essential role in providing food for children and families who are in need of it - this is especially true during the holidays  when Free School Meals (FSM) are not usually available. Recently  the government (after several U-turns) decided to extend funding for FSM over the school holidays  but several families received substandard food packages that still forced them to rely on extra aid from food banks and mutual aid community groups.    Many young people are also not entitled to free school meals during term time because their parents earn above the amount allowed for eligibility for free school meals. In England  earnings from employment must be less than £16 190 for families in receipt of Child Tax or Working Tax Credits  and only £7 400 per year for families in receipt of Universal Credit.     This is staggeringly low and  when combined with measures such as the two child limit on Universal Credit payments  means that many families struggling to put food on the table are nevertheless deemed ineligible for free school meals. Other families are unable to claim FSM for their children because they have no recourse to public funds (NPRF) which is a condition the government imposes on some families due to their immigration status.      What does this mean?    Those recently impacted by the financial costs of COVID-19 (which are only increasing)  are more likely to go hungry. This will have bothphysiological and psychological impacts on young people and their families.     Why?    The data collected by CPAG on child poverty in the UK are enraging: 4.2 million children were living in poverty in the UK in 2018-19  out of which 700 000 were in London. This has been worsened by the fact that parents and carers are twice as likely to lose their jobs due to the pandemic.     In Lewisham  according to Trust for London   37% of children are in a situation of food insecurity  and 14% of the population needs social benefits to survive. It's deeply distressing that this level of inequality exists in the UK  particularly given that we are one of the richest countries in the world.     Don’t know what living with food insecurity feels like? See here .    The figures above reflect the shocking inequality in Britain  which was already severely impacting children and young people before the worst financial effects caused by the pandemic began to be felt. Due to the government’s lackluster response to the pandemic  it is projected that the number of children in poverty will increase to 5.2 million by 2022.     We also cannot ignore that this impact has not been distributed equally: people coming from Communities of Colour and immigrant background are over twice as likely to live in hardship than their white British counterparts and  due to the wider structural racial injustices  these communities are also disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. We are certainly not 'all in this together'.      What are we doing about it?     Legendary Community Club  which was named by Chevrington Odoh from the Pro Plus FC   is a grassroots project set up by some members of Lewisham Mutual Aid in partnership with local organisations. Our aim is to deliver emergency food provision to ensure that young people do not go without out  for as long as there is a need.       We will make this happen in three ways:    1. Temporary food provisions have been set-up for families who require this support  in partnership with local schools and community groups.    2. A kitchen has been set up to prepare nutritionally balanced meals for young people through their youth clubs which run after school and in the school holidays.    We know that food charity is not a long term solution. This is not the world we want to live in and we refuse to normalise food banks as a solution to food poverty. This is NOT an inevitable situation.    3. With this in mind  we will continue to work alongside The Children's Society  who have been calling on the government to ensure that every local council adequately funds emergency support for families   so that nobody is left behind in a time of crisis. For more information about their campaign 'Strengthening the Safety Net' see here   and sign the petition here.    We will also continue to support the calls from Save the Children and Child Poverty Action Group who have been lobbying for reforms to the benefits system  as well as an increase in the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit by £20  and an end to the two child limit and the £20 000 a year benefit cap which hits families in high-rent areas such as Lewisham particularly hard. Lastly  we will continue to support IFAN with the #CashFirst campaign  which has already inspired us to start our very own community-led participatory research project (stay tuned for more on this!).     The way our tax and welfare system is designed is a political choice. There are solutions . We will call on the government and its representatives to be bold  brave and radical in how they approach this problem.       What will we use the funds for?      We will use the money raised from the community to buy food and equipment for the project.    We have a host of volunteers  and multiple clubs and schools signed up and ready to go. The project began on July 21st 2020.       £50 raised will be able to feed 45 children     £100 raised will be able to feed 90 children     £1000 raised will be able to feed 909 children       There is power in our community.

My story started 4 years ago when I ended up homeless. I was placed in a family hostel in England’s Lane  Hampstead. From the outside the street and the area are super wealthy…on the inside it’s a different matter. I was so humiliated by my new circumstances that I shut myself off from the outside world for a year. How had I lost my home  and ended up at the hostel? A brutal  run-down  frightening place! I felt so embarrassed to be bring up my baby in these circumstances and environment.    But when I looked up and saw so many single mums  struggling in the hostel I found a motivation to want to help theses families. The hostel should have been a haven for these women who had already suffered so much - often at the hand of an abusive partner  or an abusive regime they were escaping as a refugee. I realised that what these families often needed above all was a lovingly-made hot meal - and someone to show them a bit of care and support - something the system didn’t seem able to do.     I used my redundancy money to cook for families at the hostel and was supporting up to 20 families at a time from my own pocket  but of course my own funds soon ran out.    That was when I started reaching out to local charities and community groups for support and I have been overwhelmed by the enthusiastic support so many have shown me and my efforts. I managed to raise £16 000 for the families at the hostel and have supported 108 families over the last few years.     I saw first-hand how those donations  the meals and everyday essential supplies we got to the families were a life-line for them. The hostel has now been sold by the council and all the families are being moved out - some to far away places where they and their children have no connections or support.    On top of all the challenges I want to help these families face  this year  like everyone else  they’ve had coronavirus and lock down to cope with. Many families are facing the extra hardship of loss of income and job losses  as well as trying to home school in a hostel and having mental health problems caused by lock-down.     So now I really want to continue to support families like them who live in hostels - single mums fleeing domestic violence as well as others who are in need. I want to build on connections and relationships I have made over the last 4 years - with local businesses  local communities and charities who I know will continue to help me carry out this work.     In order to do that I want to register as a charity and purchase a small van. That would mean I could cook and deliver meals to families - as well as delivering other things they might need that I could source for them. I think there are so many people in need: single mums and dads with young kids or with health issues  elderly people  disabled people who often find it difficult to get to food banks or community centres for help  so I would like to bring help directly to those families in my little van.    In order to get this project off the ground I estimate that I need £11 000. I believe with support from the public  local charities and local businesses it can be achieved and I would be so grateful if you could help me to help these families who are so often not seen  overlooked or get lost in the system.    Thank you   Queeny Singh",False

I’m asking for help because  like so many people at the moment  Covid 19 and lockdown has financially defeated me. I started studying for my makeup artistry qualification during the first lockdown  and I am ready to begin my career in this field... but unfortunately  I am unable to raise the funds for my stock  insurance and even a car (which has died a death during lockdown) because I’ve been unable to work. I’m a mum of two and have been studying and homeschooling for almost a year now!   To put it bluntly  my kids and I don’t know how we’ve managed. I’ve been collecting food bank parcels  had family help me out with groceries and I’ve even had to let a few monthly bills go into arrears for a month or two because it was a choice between the bills and food. I cut down on the unnecessary bills as soon as lockdown hit us the first time  but it’s merely offered the ability to get a little more food in. It’s taken a lot of courage to admit that... not many people around me have known how bad it has been at times in my house     Makeup  for me  is about freedom of expression. It is about treating a face as a beautiful blank canvas with same scope for creativity.     Any face can be transformed by the application of makeup. It can be transformed  enhanced... and for some  improved. People use makeup for all manner of reasons; some wear it to make them feel more attractive  some wear it to feel empowered  ready to take on the day... a kind of war paint so to speak... some wear it simply for a level of personal enjoyment and creative freedom it offers... not to mention fun!!     For me  to do makeup on someone else’s beautiful face  the pleasure of seeing them feel transformed  beautiful and ready for any occasion is the most satisfaction one can experience. To take the stress of having to do yet another task for a bride on her big day  to pamper someone getting ready for going out to celebrate their birthday/anniversary anything... and see their happiness is so rewarding!     When I create looks on myself  I get to satisfy the artist in me. I can create literal art on my face and feel beautiful and confident all at once!! The level of freedom is immeasurable because there are simply no limits. And there is no greater fun in that kind of freedom.    I appreciate any support I may receive through this  it has taken a lot of courage tocreate this account  so any help will be greatly appreciated beyond words!! I only started exploring makeup properly during the first lockdown to help me stay focused  motivated and boredom free... and found myself better than I ever expected! I enrolled with Girl Meets Brush Academy and started entering challenges they posted and entered a competition last summer. I won a number of the individual challenges and was awarded the Highly Commended award and also was named one of the winners in the big competition held in August. The prize was to have a homemade video of a makeup creation showcased in the Digital London Fashion Week!! To win such a dream competition as that in such a short space of time gave me the encouragement and confidence to continue this career. My work is unique  my looks are innovative... and my passion is unmeasurable!! To say I love what I do is a severe understatement!!! ",False

Research conducted by several scientific institutions is showing that a significant number of people affected by COVID-19 go on to have symptoms for months after their initial illness. Most of us are young  previously healthy individuals who  by the official definition  initially suffered a “mild” form of the disease. Yet  months later  most of us are unable to return to work and to function at the level we were previously functioning at before falling ill.    This is beginning to attract the attention of the media  with articles being published in The Guardian  The Independent  the BBC  the Atlantic  and almost every major news provider. Despite that  the U.K. Government has so far failed to acknowledge our existence and to provide us with the medical attention and treatment we need  as is being done in other countries. We have therefore decided to launch a campaign to raise public awareness of our ongoing plight. The money we gather will be used to fund three different projects.    1.) Open letter: We plan to write an open letter signed by as many of us as possible that will be sent to decision makers  key figures  and officials in the U.K. government and the Healthcare sector to raise awareness of what we’re going through.    2.) Short Film: We are planning to produce a short film that will highlight what we’re going through. The film will include pictures of fellow “Long Haulers” holding up personal messages.    3.) Message in a Bottle: We plan to deliver a number of messages written by fellow Long Haulers to the door of Number 10  Downing Street. The messages will detail the suffering each writer has endured and will each be individually packed in a test tube to emphasise how trapped and isolated we feel. The funding will cover the costs of all three projects plus any future endeavours that the campaign team believes will contribute to raising awareness of long term covid sufferers  as well as any additional costs incurred.      The campaign team will not receive payment from the funds.      A detailed breakdown of costs as well as a description of the work currently being done can be provided by contacting the campaign team.      Any enquiries should also be directed at the campaign team.      Any funding we don’t use will be donated to food banks across the nation.

As a school  family is important to us  this year has been tough for so many different reasons and the pressures of this current climate are visible to all to see.    Many people have lost their jobs because of the virus  there has been a surge in the number of people becoming homeless and without food.    Being the community school we are  its only right that we are at the forefront of ‘building our community for our community’ we are doing this by setting up a food bank to provide food and essential items for our most vulnerable young people and families within our school and wider community.      More than 2.3 million Londoners live below the poverty line and 33% of adults have skipped meals to save money so that their children can eat.      The Charter School North Dulwich Go fund me page will help us to raise money to purchase food for our most vulnerable young people and families. During the festive period food was donated to the Southwark central community hub.

About 200 per fortnight. I cook the meals with love and care and it is a privilege to be able to do so.     I began by wanting to help NHS and Care Home staff during the first Covid 19 lockdown in March 2020. So far I have cooked 0ver 6000 meals that I have made as delicious  pretty and nutritional as possible. I have also made sure they can be safely frozen and defrosted and can be re-heated in a microwave.     After 2 periods of self-isolation I started cooking from home on the 24th of April 2020 for the staff at my local care home  an NHS critical care nurse and a weeks worth of meals for an 89 year old I've been cooking for since he lost his wife years ago.     I have moved from 52 meals to a maximum of 206 on January 11 2021 and I am averaging about 100 per week at the moment (June 2021 ) I keep some meals in my freezer so that if anyone has a tough shift  they can contact me and I can give them a home-cooked meal to go home with. I spend 14 hours or so every Wednesday cooking for carers and will continue to do so for as long as I can; hopefully the rest of my life. The NHS has looked after me and my kids brilliantly and I want to give back.     I am utterly inspired by the NHS  Community Centre and Care Home Staff I meet. They make me want to be kinder  work harder and just be better.     My ultimate goal is to do this by teaching kids how to do the cooking with so that there is a double and ever growing benefit. But for now  I want to feed people and make their lives a little bit easier. I want them to be able to rely on a meal from me every Wednesday or Thursday.    Giving one person a wonderful meal means something. Donating is the same.

Our plan is to have a refill shop run by the community and by people who have special education needs.       The refill shop will be run as a community interest company to keep the food prices competitive with local supermarkets  which would mean everyone can afford to shop plastic free helping the environment.        All money that is not put back into the buisness will go to local and environment causes.       We will also have a recycling center in our courtyard for everything that cannot go in the local grey bins.       Working with local organisations and supporting the Rutland Food Bank by taking donations at the shop and donating things that are coming to the end of their sell by dates.   We really need your help and support to set this up and are asking for donations to help start our new and exciting community project. Any donation big or small will be very much appreciated.   Also if companies would like to donate we will put a small thank you sticker with their logo onto what we bought with their money (this will most lightly be a food storage box or storage tube).   If you think you could help in any other way please contact us. We need people to help set up the shop i.e. - help with fitting  painting  decorating etc. Also help with running the shop like book keeping  restocking  ordering  working on the shop floor.   Thank you for reading and if you can help us it would be so appreciated      Jenni and Rutland Refill team ",False
