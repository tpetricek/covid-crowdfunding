Free Meals  Full Hearts is designed to bridge that gap and ensure that if your situations changes quickly  or you just need a little help - we're here for you. Anonymously.    I have heard some truly eye opening stories since creating this charitable group - everything from families only eating one meal a day and a couple who hadn't had a hot meal in days to another family who had literally only eaten canned beans and hoops for 10 days solidly because their weekly food budget was £9 to feed 5. It really does put life in perspective.    No-one in our community should go hungry. Ever.    The Reading community has shown time and time again that when faced with challenges or adversities  we come together. The camaraderie  generosity and positivity around us every day is overwhelming.    Feeding yourself and your family is a basic but essential human necessity but unfortunately far too many people in the Reading area are skipping meals and going hungry because they simply can't afford to eat. I can only imagine this must be particularly heartbreaking if you're a parent who is unable to feed your children. As momentum has increased and more and more people have heard about Free Meals  Full Hearts and we occasionally find ourselves struggling to help due to lack of physical food donations. When this happens  I either dip into the reserve pot or sometimes  out of my own pocket i'll buy emergency food shops for families (between £30-£50 per week depending on the size of the family). I have also ordered last minute takeaways for families and bought other essential items such as medical prescriptions and personal hygiene and cleaning products    'Free Meal  Full Hearts' is a anonymous platform where people (single  couples or families) can reach out and ask for food should they need to  without judgement.    If you are able to help  please do. It's massively appreciated - not just by me  but by every family who are committed to helping    Thank You    Newpaper Article",False

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.    All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.    If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free. Thankyou for your support.    The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need  providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.    All the best    Jack Monroe.

THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AS SAFE FROM CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) AS OTHERS.    Every moment matters. As the virus spreads in the UK  people living in poverty are among the most vulnerable to the worst outcomes of the virus  because they:      - Can’t afford basic hygiene essentials like hand wash  soap and hand sanitiser that will help protect them from infection.    - Can’t afford to stockpile essential everyday items    - Rely on food banks for their basic hygiene essentials  and due to public stockpiling  food banks’ supplies are dwindling fast     - Live or stay in crowded environments like homeless shelters  refuges and safe-houses    - Live in densely populated areas    - Work in low-income jobs in highly populated public spaces    - Don’t have a home to live in    Beauty Banks  the people-powered movement that supports people living in hygiene poverty in the UK has joined (virtual) hands with crowd-funding platform  GoFundMe to support those who can’t afford to take extra precautions to help keep them safe from what has been labelled ‘the worst public health crisis for a generation’  coronavirus (COVID-19).    Your support will help us to provide emergency hygiene parcels that will help protect those at higher risk and more vulnerable to being infected by the virus.       YOUR DONATION WILL BE SPENT ON:    - SOAP (adult & baby)  - BODYWASH  - HANDWASH  - HAND SANTISER  - LAUNDRY DETERGENT    All donations will be shared with Beauty Banks’ UK registered charity partners that include food banks  homeless shelters  domestic abuse refuges  youth centres  NHS trusts and refugee centres across the UK.

A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems. Barrow Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. There has never been a more crucial time to help those who are less fortunate than us - which is why I have organised this event.     The Covid-19 effect   Well before Covid-19 hit the UK  food banks in the Trussell Trust network had been seeing year-on-year increases in levels of need  with 1.9 million emergency food parcels given out in 2019/20. As Covid-19 hit the UK  the Trussell Trust saw an immediate and sustained surge in need across its food banks. In April there was an 89% increase in the number of emergency food parcels given out compared with the same month in 2019. This included a 107% increase in the number of parcels given to children  compared to the same period last year. New findings show that almost 100 000 households received support from a food bank in the Trussell Trust network for the very first time between April and June 2020. It's no secret that the pandemic has had a significant impact on people's jobs and finances - increasing the use of foodbanks nationwide.     What are we doing?   Since March 2020  many people (including myself) have adopted a new hobby in running. Whether it is to pass time  get out of the house  keep fit whilst the gyms are closed or a tool to manage your mental health. Everyone has their individual reasons for running and it would be fantastic to use this as an opportunity to help and support our local foodbank through completing a half marathon challenge (13.1 miles or 21.09 kilometres).     When?  Those who are taking part will complete the run on either Friday 23rd April  Saturday 24th April or Sunday 25th April - uploading their run to the page when complete.     Donations  There is a group target amount of £1 000 and every penny donated is hugely appreciated. However  I am conscious of the financial difficulties that many people face due to the current situation  therefore  it is absolutely fine if you are unable to donate - you can always share this page instead!     If you would like more information or if you would like to take part  please message me directly.     https://barrow.foodbank.org.uk/    https://www.trusselltrust.org/    ",False

Virus Covid-19 our family feel really strongly about supporting those who are less able  less fortunate and are alone at this time.    We have decided to come together as a family and put together care packages which we will distribute out and deliver to those in need. We know there are thousands of people who could really benefit from this so whilst we are fundraising to purchase the goods to make the packages we are also asking households to donate goods too. This could be anything from frozen meals  toilet rolls  tins and non perishable goods.    We are also supporting all the incredible staff at the NHS across London  we’ve provided them fresh cooked meals and supplying drinks and snacks during their long shifts plus some hospitals have set up internal food banks for the staff to be able to take home essential items for their families.

The Project /Building Purley Masjid​    Purley Masjid is a modern Islamic community centre in a suburb of South London  Purley. It was established in 2015 after fund raising to accommodate the needs of the local Muslim community.    Ma Sha’ Allah  the Masjid is now trying to cope with the demand and has to overcome many challenges to support the Muslim and also non-Muslim community. Here are just a few of examples of the issues:     We have one main hall which accommodates only 200 people for an average Jumu’ah congregation of over 400.      People often have to wait outside in the forecourt for the second Jamaat     Current facilities for ladies accommodates around 30  whereas the demand is known to be in excess of 150. This is severely restricting our ability to meet current demand for women     Our lectures  Fitness Classes  Mother and Toddlers group  daily iftaris in Ramadhan and seniors meet up sessions all take place on the same carpeted area on which we pray. This is not ideal and as we are effectively operating out of one hall  it means that we can only have one activity happening at any given time     The Food Bank only has enough space for a shelf rack to store food. It caters for anyone in need in the Purley community  Muslim and non-Muslim alike        By the Grace of Allah swt we have embarked on the Building Purley Masjid project that will cater for the needs of the community. The project will result in a new Masjid on the current Purley Masjid site and will be a modern  purpose built building for the community spanning 6 floors that will include:     Two male prayer halls with a combined capacity of 500     A ladies prayer hall with capacity of over 200 and crèche facilities      A multi purpose hall     A dedicated lecture/events hall (we held over 100 last year)  which can accommodate 100 people     Improved facilities for our already existing Youth Activities  Mother and Toddlers Group and Seniors Group     Separate classrooms for our Madrasah classes      More space for our weekly Food Bank  ​​    We already have all these activities running at Purley Masjid but are struggling to meet demands and keep up the excellent level of service we provide.",False

50","Raising money for frontline nhs staff for food  accommodation and whatever else needed  and putting back into the community for food banks for families unable to work So lockdown is now upon us all so I thought of a way of raising money for nhs frontline staff and foodbanks for families unable to work  And a way to keep people smiling  So..... nominate a friend to shave there hair ( it’ll grow back by the time we’re out of this sh#t ) They name there price  Check the link to see if they’ve donated And shave it !!!!! Please copy and share and let’s see how much we can raise for this much needed cause and have a barrel of laughs along the way. Before and after pics will make it so much funnier ",False

experiencing an unprecedented challenge. It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has launched to support our community and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.    The Lambeth Food Bank Fund     Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.    In Lambeth we have a history of looking after one another - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.     So we are creating something called the Lambeth Food Bank Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.     Our borough has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has been set up for us to help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.     Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Lambeth. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.      * * *    FAQs    What can I do?    Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the most vulnerable.     Where will the funds go?    The funds will go to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by Holy Trinity Clapham and delivered to food banks across the borough - including Brixton & Norwood  Clapham Park  Vauxhall  and Waterloo - that can help the most vulnerable.     If I do donate will it go to those who need it?     Yes  your donation will go to those who need it. Unlike other platforms  GoFundMe do not charge a fundraising fee although they take a small transaction fee. See here for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to.     I want to help my local community  will this money be spent in Lambeth?     Yes.     Where can I find accurate information about covid-19?     For general information on CV-19  please visit the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response    Lambeth Council have some useful information: https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/elections-and-council/about-lambeth/coronavirus-covid-19-information    If you are worried about your own health  call the NHS on 111.",False

Roes Senior men's team have decided to raise funds for local organisations during the current Covid-19 situation.    Our aim is to have each team member run 5km around Moorlough at staggered set times to adhere to social distancing guidelines from sun rise to sun set on Saturday 2nd May. We hope to run 200km collectively throughout the entire day.    The run will begin at 6am with the first man running the course with the last run scheduled for sunset at around 9pm.    Our Club man Cathal McShane has kindly donated a number of prizes for a raffle. Prizes include:    1) His All Ireland Final jersey from 2018 vs Dublin  2) The boots he wore on the day  3) The Boots he wore vs Meath in which he kicked the equalising point to take it to extra time.    Details of this can be found on Cathal's social media pages and the club social media pages.    We have also received some further generous donations of prizes for the raffle.    James ' The Strabanimal' Gallagher has kindly donated a signed pair of MMA gloves worn at his last fight.    Ronan McNamee (Aghyaran &Tyrone) has kindly donated a Signed Jersey.    Peak Performance Gym Strabane- 1 years Gym Membership      The chosen organisations to which we will be donating to are as follows:    -Strabane Food Bank  -Aware in Strabane  -Dennett interchange meals on wheels  -COVID wards Altnagelvin  -Speech and Language Therapy ICU Altnagelvin    We hope to raise as much money as we possibly can for those in need during this time.

Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland. Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen feed people seven days a week and will now be able to buy pallets of fresh produce to cook with  whilst the foodbank will be able to use the money to produce emergency three day food parcels.

BodyFit team   fundraising page. We’re a local outdoor fitness bootcamp in the communities of Glasgow south  Hamilton and   Kilmarnock. We aim to raise £3000 for our   3 local food banks in Glasgow  Hamilton and  Kilmarnock. We want to support our   communities and people in them who are  most in need during this unprecedented   time.    The challenge its self is a team relay   completing 1 hour of running over 24hrs   attempting to complete 4 back to back   Marathons. A massive 104.8 miles.    Your support and donation will be greatly  appreciated. All funds will go directly to each   food bank. Thank you from all the BodyFit team. ",False

Pema is now 10 months old  when she was born  the mother texted me from the hospital saying she’s giving her up for adoption without consulting me.  I then went through social service and claimed her back. During the parental assessment I brought up an issue that I’m on zero hour contract teaching violin for local council music program and covid 19 means all of my concerts and gigs are cancelled.  The social workers have been reassuring me that I will get help from the government  but the financial support is based on calculations and seems to ignore the fact that I have no income when there’s no school.   I’m quite desperate now because all the schools are in the settling period meaning they won’t start music or instrumental lessons until October.   I always get paid for September at the   end of October. With no work in September  there is no pay in October. Works I do in October will pay at the end of November. It’s only mid September and I can’tsurvive until the end of November.  In October I will have to start taking my daughter to child minder  and I have to payahead. I just can’t hold out that long. And I have a lot of debt also since lockdown started(from friends and credit card) I am staying at the homeless hostel room so we are ok for accommodation now but universal credit won’t pay me this month because I received self employed grant in August but that’s only £500.  I will be super grateful if you can help.   I also have been visiting food bank and soif you can contribute to nappy and formula cost  that will be great.  best wishes   Andy ",False

Twenty percent of all donations goes to local charities named here from time to time. So far we have been giving to the vulnerable families charity Home-Start West Lothian  to WL Food Bank  Bipolar Scotland (Bathgate)  and Enable Scotland (Crofthead  Livingston  in memoriam Philip Fleming)  Broxburn and Uphall Community Website  Almond Valley Heritage Trust  Uphall Community Education Centre Association....     A pipe-walking roadmap  With the Scottish Government relaxation of lockdown guidelines on 28 May I began gradually reducing the frequency and extent of my pipe-walking  concentrating on the main or bigger streets. I had a quiet autumn and even quieter winter  but as of early April 2021 I am getting active again. I plan to continue as last year  but much less intensively. Please keep requests coming for any special events and occasions you may have. For children and the elderly  ill or vulnerable  the level of modest donations I suggest is significantly lower than for others.    And if you know your history....   On 28.3.20  I picked up my oft idle bagpipes and started wandering rather cluelessly round Broxburn and Uphall playing them. I had realised that as a semi-retired person I was pretty much 'alright Jack' under lockdown and wondered if I could do anything to help others. My first idea  on 20 May  had been to go to NHS Strathbrock and play for the amusement of staff and patients. That day I also put my busking hat down with a sign saying ""all proceeds to...."" After securing permission from the police  I decided to put the hat back on my head and start my ""pipe-walks"" around Kirkhill and West End  intending to return to the Strathbrock  of course  and at least three facilities for older residents near me. Soon I was getting more than one request on average per day  from all over B&U and beyond....     Thank you  t.... y..  t.... y..  +1 ⚓☀️   I have been so astonished and moved by the huge warm response everywhere I've walked and played in the months since. Many people were soon wanting to give me money in return for my effort to cheer them up and relieve boredom  and when I refused all payment some suggested I should start some kind of fundraiser. Enter Kelly - thank you. I'm already adding to and improving my musical equipment and piper's costume. If it is welcomed by you  B&U  this new GoFundMe will continue that  compensate me for lost busking earnings during lockdown  while giving 20% to charity.",False

We are using our 3D printers to produce face shields  which we are distributing to local health-care workers  nurses  care homes  pharmacists  and others who need them. The demand has been overwhelming  as has the offers of help. These workers are putting their health and even their lives at risk in order to keep South Queensferry healthy  so we are doing what we can to support them with 3D printing technology.     We are currently running three printers. The masks take just under an hour each to print. So we are trying to raise funds in order to purchase a fourth printer  (likely an Ender 3  or a CR-10)  which will enable us to make far more masks  and help far more people.     The money will also be used to buy supplies as needed  more PVC sheets  more filament  or more elastics. We will also support anyone else in the community who has a printer  and wants to join our team.     Once this crisis has passed  and it *will* pass  we will be donating the printer and any left over supplies to the local high school. There it will be used to teach a new generation on how to use this technology  so that next crisis we will be even more prepared to help. Any leftover money will be donated to the food bank.     3D printing has  all around the world  proven to be vital during this epidemic. There are ER rooms in Spain  midwives in the Philippines  nurses in Sweden  all using 3D printed face shields  when no other protection is available.

It is more important than ever that we work together to support one another. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund has launched to provide support to those most at need in our community. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund Right now many of us are understandably feeling anxious and vulnerable  but there are many among us that need immediate support in order to ensure that they can have access to food. Greenwich residents have a proud history of looking after one another - and never has this been more important than now. So I have been working with Greenwich Food Bank to create the Greenwich Food Bank Fund. As the borough faces one of its most important challenges in living memory  the Fund has been set up to ensure that those in need across the borough have access to the help they need. Please  even during this most difficult of times  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Greenwich. Please be assured that even the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference. Thank you for your generosity. FAQs Where will the funds go? The funds will go directly to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by the Greenwich Food Bank and delivered to food banks across the borough  from Blackheath to Eltham  Kidbrooke  Thamesmead and beyond. A full list of food bank locations is available at https://greenwich.foodbank.org.uk/locations/. If I donate will it go directly to those who need it? Yes  your donation will go directly to Greenwich Food Bank. Unlike some other platforms  GoFundMe does not charge a fundraising fee although it takes a small transaction fee. See https://www.gofundme.com/c/free-fundraising for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to. Will the money be spent in Greenwich? Yes. Is there anything else I can do? The most immediate need is to raise finance  so that purchasing can continue. However there is also a need to: (1) donate food where possible; and (2) create a team of delivery drivers as the Food Bank moves to a delivery model. If you are able to help with either of these  please email [email redacted].uk. Where can I find more information about Covid-19?

The blasts in Beirut  were pretty devastating  but the important news in all this was that more than 6 000 people were injured  plus 150 killed  dozens still missing to this hour as rescue teams search for them  & hundreds of homes & people’s livelihoods were shattered  rendering nearly 3000 homeless.     As a result  Beirut has been declared a disaster striken city.     With the port -- Lebanon's economical lifeline -- totally destroyed   food shortages will spike & many families will go without.Already  Lebanon was suffering from massive food & fuel shortages  and now it will not be able to import anything. Bleak  darker days for hundreds of thousands of people lie ahead!     This is urgent.     Lebanon needs you now.    Please donate so we can ensure people have a place to stay safe  food to eat & the means to survive & overcome this catastrophe.    Pray for lebanon ...    Your help is more needed than ever     Your donations will help contribute to:    -hospital bills  -small repairs  -Buy basic food items to put together food parcels for many who will have nothing to eat today and in many more days to come.   -Life saving medications for those in need & unable to afford those.We need to help those on the ground with whatever means we can.    Help us help people   we beg you!         ___________________________________      Half the population are living in abject poverty.     People are dying  not from Covid  but from starvation  lack of medication and healthcare.    The economy  currency and banking system have failed. Inflation has been the final blow. Many in work have not been paid for months and others have lost their job and cannot feed their families or pay the rent.     Callers from across Lebanon have been begging for help on the programme “Sahtak Bill Dinyeh ” (your health is worth the world) on Sawt al Ghad radio .    Helped by many charitable people  the programme’s host Dory Nasr has distributed food  medicine and basic necessities.        Now the warehouse is empty.      Lebanese around the world and those sympathetic to the country’s plight can help by donating what they can. Every penny helps  paying for baby milk  food  medicine and housing.    Hala and Dana  two British-Lebanese expats  decided to kickstart this fundraiser to help secure both continuity and replenishment of the food bank. This is a much needed lifeline  without which many families will be doomed with both hunger and displacement.       Le Liban est au bord de l’effondrement total.    La moitié de la population vit dans une pauvreté extrême.    Les gens meurent  non pas de Covid  mais de faim  de manque de médicaments et de soins de santé.    L'économie  la monnaie et le système bancaire ont échoué. L'inflation a été le coup de grâce. Beaucoup d’employés n'ont pas reçu leurs salaires depuis des mois et d'autres ont perdu leur emploi et ne peuvent plus nourrir leurs familles  payer le loyer ou acheter des medicaments vitaux.    Les appelants de part et d’autre du Liban ont imploré l'aide sur l'émission «Sahtak Bill Dinyeh» (votre santé vaut le monde) sur la radio Sawt al Ghad .    Avec l’aide de nombreuses personnes charitables  l’animateur du programme  Dori Nasr  a distribué de la nourriture  des médicaments et des produits de première nécessité.    Maintenant  l'entrepôt est vide.    Les Libanais au monde entier et les sympathisants du sort du pays peuvent aider en donnant ce qu’ils peuvent. Chaque centime aide à payer pour le lait infantile  la nourriture  les médicaments et le logement. ",False

I'm trying to raise money for Glasgow Food Banks which have become a disgrace to our society. After the Conservatives came into power in 2010  there has been a significant increase in Food Banks. The reason for this is that the Conservatives have imposed a large set of austerity measure which have removed the safety net from the most vulnerable in our society. This was a Conservative Government which the Scottish people DID NOT VOTE FOR. As a consequence more and more people are having to rely on using Food Banks just to survive. Imagine waking up every day and not being able to even feed your children never mind yourself? Well  unfortunately this is the harsh reality of what we are currently living in.    I will be walking from London to Glasgow on the 2nd of September to join the Independence rally on the 17th of September in order to raise funds for this cause. There will be the possibility of hitchhiking during the trip due to either severe exhaustion or running out of time to arrive in Glasgow. Therefore if you could possibly give as much as possible throughout this time period it would be greatly appreciated. I have my own funds to get there myself  therefore every single penny of your donation will be distributed to all the Food Banks within Glasgow. I will also be posting regularly on my twitter account: @thejohnsonss where I shall display my route to Glasgow in the coming days.    The reason this means so much to me is because the City of Glasgow is my home. On the 18th of September I am proud to say that The City of Glasgow voted YES - to Independence in order to help bring people out of poverty.    Similarly  the whole of Scotland unanimously voted to remain within the European Union. Yet to be pulled out of the European Union against our will is a complete and utter shambles. This can only mean that to stay within Britain  the use of Food Banks will steadily become the norm. This is not something I want for my country. I strongly believe that together Scotland though independence  and remaining part of the European Union can prosper as a Nation and prevent this occurrence from happening.    Not only will I be so thankful if you could please help to reach this target of £20 000  but I know others will be too. The demand for Food Banks is only increasing which means we must do what we can to help. Please share this far and wide. Please give what you can. Even a simple pound could buy a few tins of beans for someone.     Thank you.    Saor Alba  #Indy2",False

and tampons  for people who menstruate and are experiencing homelessness or poverty. . Every Month will provide people in the Manchester and Greater Manchester area  who are experiencing poverty   with 'period packs'. These packs will include  tampons  pantie liners  sanitary pads  menstrual cups wipes and hot chocolate sachets. I want to get these packs into homeless shelters and food banks  where they will be easily accessible to those who need them! I would really appreciate it if you could help support Every Month by donating to our GoFundMe page and sharing it. Thank you!

Diaspora are coming together to raise funds to rebuild Lebanon's capital Beirut and support all impacted communities.    We are asking you to help us  by donating what you can to this crowdfund  and joining us on 22 August for an evening of pride  performance and love for Beirut  its people and its reconstruction. Rebuilding Beirut with Pride will be hosted at the Bell Pub in Whitechapel  and live-streamed all night for everyone to watch and take part in. From an art auction to a programme of performance  we want to celebrate Arab and queer art and talent and help rebuild our hometown in the process. Click here to buy your tickets for the event.    Where is the money going?    All proceeds will be equally split and donated to the Lebanese Red Cross  Beit El Baraka   Basmeh & Zeitooneh and Embrace Lebanon   as well as two grassroots LGBT+ crowdfunds  detailed below.     Beit El Baraka provide food banks for victims of the disaster  Basmeh & Zeitooneh are responding on the ground to those who have been made homeless  and Embrace Lebanon offers mental health support.     The NGOs were chosen after having direct discussions with several people within Lebanon itself who informed us of which organisations are trustworthy and are not affiliated with government authorities in any way  to ensure the money is directly going to support those in need first and foremost.    We have also identified two crowdfunds that have been strongly recommended to us by many members of Beirut's LGBTQ+ community  in that they are offering on-the-ground and direct support and are being led by trusted community members.     These crowdfunds are Disaster Relief for Lebanese Transgender Community   led by Lebanese trans pioneer Sasha Elijah  and Funds for LGBTQ Victims of Beirut Explosion   led by prominent community member Sandra Melhem.    The total sum raised will be split 6-way between these 6 beneficiaries  and receipts of these donations will be posted here for completely transparency.     Why are we fundraising?     Beirut is a disaster zone. On the 4th of August  the city was rocked by a colossal explosion involving 2 750 tons of ammonium nitrate. To put things in perspective  it is one of the worse urban explosions since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The blast killed at least 157 people and injured 5 000. Hundreds remain missing. With the force of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake  the explosion's shock wave enveloped Beirut  shattering windows and collapsing old buildings. Lebanon's hospitals - already overrun by coronavirus - are in dire need of support. Meanwhile  around 300 000 people have been displaced from their homes. Two of Beirut's LGBTQ+ hubs  Mar Mikhael and Gemmayze  were only 500m away from the point of detonation. These areas have been utterly devastated and  like many other parts of Beirut  are now uninhabitable.    The blast comes at the worse time for Lebanon  hitting a country already in disaster. Covid-19 exacerbated a pre-existing political and economic crisis  bringing the Lebanese to the brink of collapse. This year has seen thousands of Lebanese lose their lifetime savings and the country's hyper-inflated currency remains in free-fall. One in the three people are unemployed  while amongst Lebanon's poorest  famine is approaching. In short  your donations are needed. They will support those people immediately impacted by the explosion  but also Lebanese communities and families facing economic desolation. Please see below for which NGOs and groups we are donating to.    What's happening on the 22nd?     While we encourage you support us  share this page and ask all your friends to donate throughout the next two weeks  we have an exciting day planned to drum up even more donations! On 22 August there are two events you need to know about:    6:30PM: Art Auction (online)     We will be auctioning a collection of both Arab and Queer art  prints and designs  kindly donated by artists and designers from both the UK and Lebanon. More details to come  including some sneak peaks at some of the pieces! All proceeds will be added to the goal target. This will be an online auction so everyone can take part!     Interested? Put in your details here to keep up to date with the auction so you don't miss out on any information!     Are you an artist who would like to donate a piece to be included in the auction? Let us know here!    8:00PM: Performances (In person & live streamed)    Rebuilding Beirut with Pride will be hosted at the Bell Pub in Whitechapel  and live-streamed all night for everyone to watch. We have a line up of performers showcasing Arab and Queer talent with opportunities and activities to donate to the fund throughout the night. A full programme of the night will be released shortly.     We only have a limited number of 30 tickets for the in-person event and will be following strict social distancing measures  including table service and contactless payment.     But don't worry! We have 500 tickets available for our online live stream  where you can take part in the night.     Click here to buy your tickets for the event .       Who are we?

Although the fund-raising page says donations will go straight to Michael Faulkner  who is secretary of Churches Together in Ilkley  in fact of course money will go directly to the Foodbank .",False

Due to the massive shortages of PPE masks and other protective equipment for NHS Front line staff  care workers and volunteers  not just locally but across the country during the current Covid-19 crisis  I have decided to use my time and experience as a creative prop maker in the film industry to help our front line heroes who are putting themselves in harms way every day to keep the public safe.    I want to help the drive to produce 3D printed full face visors based on a recognised format and supply them to staff at out local hospitals  care homes and local volunteers at food banks etc.    My plan is to be producing around 200 visors per week and all donations will be going towards purchasing 2 Eryone 3D printers  filament for the visor frames  clear plastic for the screens  bags for packing and transport as well as wear and tear on equipment.    There is a massive need at the moment and for the foreseeable future for these masks and the more creative industry workers we have making these  the more of our front line heroes will have a chance at being safer in their work.    The spirit and generosity I am seeing as a front line volunteer myself every day simply astounds and humbles me  and I sincerely hope that same spirit and generosity will be shown to this campaign and why I want to do it.

We're raising money in aid of THE FRIENDS OF THE CHELSEA AND WESTMINSTER HOSPITAL and every donation will help. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to us.       OUR PROJECT IS TO FEED THE NIGHT SHIFT STAFF ON ITU WARDS    WHO WE ARE     We are Joe and Annabelle Colairo and  together with our family  we run a Cafe and Outside Catering company called Masters on Blackfriars Road  London. This is now closed  except for the kitchens  but check us out @ www.masterscatering.co.uk& on instagram @ masterscatering_london      THE PROBLEM      A consultant at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital told us that ""frontline staff were having a terrible and stressful time  working 12-14 hour shifts with no food available to them. The canteens are closed at night. The frontline staff  many of whom live alone  some of whom have to go to food banks  are exhausted after their long shifts "".          (Quotes from Alison Hulme’s texts - she is the Consultant paediatric surgeon who alerted us to this problem.)        “The IT Nurses are most at risk - poor things. I think they are having a gruelling time and so shopping and cooking is just too much for them when they are so low  both physically and emotionally”      “There is no time during shifts for a break  but a meal before or after would be hugely appreciated.”        THE SOLUTION      We specialise in supplying freshly cooked  nutritious and delicious meals. Joe is up at 4 in the morning  sourcing the best produce in New Covent Garden Market.      Since the 28th March  our chefs Sergio  Luis & Cesar have generously and freely volunteered to provide between 40 and 60 hot meals to frontline staff at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and The Royal London Hospital  Mile End.        WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP      Unfortunately we can’t sustain the cost of the food and packaging on our own any longer  and that’s why we need you.      You can be sure that your gift is well spent and it reaches the people most at risk and need.      * We are working on a NOT-FOR-PROFIT basis  * We have all the health  safety and 5* Hygiene certificates  * We know our nutritious meals will help keep the nurses healthier  * We know they will go directly to the nurses who need them most  those on the frontline  * Delivery is arranged by The Chelsham Road Community Association  who have Alison Hulme  a consultant paediatric surgeon  making sure it is delivered directly to the now expanded ITU unit. It goes in at 9pm.  * They also deliver treats  vitamin shots  fresh fruit and also much needed Organic Juice from PIPORGANIC.COM which is being supplied totally for free. The PPE kit is like wearing a plastic bag and dehydration is a problem for the nurses wearing it  * There are no middle men or large corporations taking a cut as with some other organisations  * The cost per meal is £3.50       PLEASE DONATE AND HELP US TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE CARING FOR US      In our experience  there are many donations for frontline staff working during the day  but not for those working at night. Where there are donations of food to the night shift staff  they never make it to them; and that's why we need your help.      “ Someone delivered 15 Pizzas 2 days ago and left them at reception. By the time they got to ITU there were only 2! “      WE KNOW OUR MEALS GET DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO ITU. ( By volunteers every night from Chelsham Road)      Here are some testimonials….      “Every day for the past 2 weeks I have collected 40 delicious wholesome  freshly cooked meals  half of which are vegetarian. The offering is wholeheartedly generous  inventive  varied  nutritious and of great quality.   I met one nurse leaving a 14 hour day shift  who had had some of Joe and Annabelle's meals when she was on night duty. She said “ Oh my goodness  I can’t tell you what a lifeline this is. Who are these people who are so amazing? It means so much to us - it makes me want to cry . I’ve been working all day and only finishing now at 9pm means I haven’t been able to eat all day. It’s like a war zone in there. Thank you  thank you  thank you. This is just what we need.” - Janie from Chelsham Road    ""ITU and theatre nurses are very grateful"" - Ben  Consultant     One of the nurses said they were anxious about getting ill and that its a very worrying time for them. They said the food is amazing and it gives them something to look forward to after a tough shift.      * The cost per meal is £3.50. We deliver 7 days a week which is 280 meals each week to Chelsea and we are looking to raise £980 amount per week.   We have the capacity to deliver more meals to different frontline staff in other hospitals if we have the funds and only if we have the direct access with the frontline staff and operating theatre night managers. Your money will go towards meals for those that need it most.       Thank you so much for making this possible.      Yours faithfully    Joe and Annabelle",False

With so many people facing either unemployment or reduced work there will obviously be an extra strain on the local charities like PATCH who support those in need through food-banks and various other means. PATCH is a charity that helps support us here in Milford Haven and all the surrounding areas.     Our aim is to raise £500 for PATCH by collectively running up the highest mountain in Wales  in Europe and in the World: Snowdon  Mont Blanc and Everest  a whopping 14714m. We will be measuring this by counting our collective 'Elevation gain' on Strava. That is not simply running 14714m  it is 14714m of climbing vertically!! Any walk  run or hill sprint will count towards this! Please help support us in what we think is an excellent cause.    Do you want to join us in making a difference? We're raising money in aid of PEMBROKESHIRE ACTION TO COMBAT HARDSHIP (PATCH) and every donation will help. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to us.",False

Since we were founded 10 months ago  we have continued to support local schools and their families with vital food packages. This is something that is really important to us as we have come to realise how many people are struggling in the county and have been shocked by it. We have built a fantastic relationship with local schools and knowing we are doing something for these young people and their families is very rewarding. As well as schools we have provided food packages to the Northamptonshire community mental health team  'leaving care': an organisation for individuals who are leaving the care system  HM probation services  local community groups as well as many families or vulnerable individuals who have reached out for support.     The McCarthy-Dixon foundation started initially as an emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a food bank and food delivery service. We have quickly broadened our services after realising the scope of both poverty and hardship in the local area. The community has always been at the heart of what we do and this means we will change and adapt to what the community needs.",False

The post involved me telling a little about my life since losing my wife Michelle.     She was 37yrs old. She died after the flu virus caused a massive cardiac arrest. She died in front of me in Whiston hospital and the A & E team struggled for six minutes to bring her back. They did manage to do so and she survived a further 7 days before a brain scan shown irreparable brain damage and I was told there was nothing could be done for her. We withdrew care on Easter Sunday 2016.     Michelle (like myself) was a primary school teacher. As such  following her death I have recieved a small pension from her. Every month since she passed awaya I try to use some of the money I receive from her pension to help a cause that catches my eye in her memory. These are usually things like friends running marathons  park benches in memory of people who have died or other things that touch me.     This month my son Billy and me decided we should do something about the number of people in our local area who simply do not have enough food in their homes to feed their families. So we used some of the money from Michelle's pension and the money we would have spent on Christmas dinner (as we have been invited to a friends house) to buy all sorts of 'stuff' to give to our local food bank. We bought tinned veg  nappies  sanitary towels  baby wipes and UHT milk. It felt great doing this. Money well spent.     Someone asked me to post 'our efforts' in the group and the response was unbelievable. It seems to have touched the hearts of many people. 4500+ (and climbing) reactions  hundreds of shares. I was amazed. I have had several people send me money via my paypal account and many more ask how they can help. So I thought as I had perhaps unwittingly created a platform to help people out I would ask for that help via a GoFundMe page. I think that's how people do these things now?    One of the emails I had was from someone who sent me £2 with an apology. 'I am sorry it isn't more.' I wrote back to say £2 will never ever 'not be enough'. If £2 is what you can afford to give then £2 is enough. £2 is amazing. £2 could help turn someone's life around. So yep...I am asking for £2. More if you can afford it...less if I am asking too much. My point is...it does not matter how much. What matters is you did.     So there it is. I am not sure how successful this will be but if everyone who reacted to my initial post gave £2 that would double the amount I am trying to raise. To be fair...how much I put in the box isnt a goal. My goal is to raise as much as I can to buy food and other essential items for people who need it. If it's another £2 then that's 4 packets of sanitary towels...if it is another £200 then that is trolleys full of food. £2000 and I think we may be genuinely changing lives. Something everyone could take pride in.     I would ask this one thing though...I would ask that if you do decide to donate to this fund raising that you do not hide your name. I want to know who you are. I want my son to see you. This is as much about helping me in #makingaman out of my boy as it is helping people you don't know eat. That's an awful thing to write...helping people eat  but its were we are right now. Let's help people eat.     Thank you. ",False

For 4 years  we owned a prominent petrol/gas station in Hillsborough  North Carolina (USA)  until it tragically caught fire in June  2009. Our insurance company did not give us a fair payout. In December  2007 we moved our family to Ghana  Africa to start up a new business and carry out missionary duties. After a series of extreme robberies  we decided to join my husband's side of the family in the United Kingdom to start a new life.      For the past 6 ½ years  the Home Office have denied our family the right to remain and work in the UK several times after arriving on a visitor’s visa. Because of our legal status in the UK  we are not entitled to ANY benefits (despite my son being born here)  and have been dependant on food banks  our church  and the kindness of strangers.     Despite these barriers  our family have been heavily involved in our community here and play an instrumental role in various lives. Collectly  we have won several awards for the way we engage  volunteer and serve our community.    On the 14th of October  2015 we had a tribunal hearing  but our case was immediately dismissed by the judge. We were left devastated  humiliated and depressed  to say the least.     A week later  (22nd of October  2015) my husband passed away suddenly due to the stress of moving our family back to the States and the thought of his children's hopes and aspirations were shattered.    Me and my 4 children have been left devastated  destitute and hopeless. Our health is down. Our minds are overcrowded. We terribly miss our leader and provider. Kitoko was an extraordinary human being who was always giving  loving  and a true server to humanity. He was a father who loved his family unconditionally and invested time and love into us.     Our family are in serious  desperate need of help to raise money primarily for a new appeal  solicitor's fees  everyday living cost  (food  utilities  housing  transportation  school lunches  medical bills  etc.) and money for a tombstone for Kitoko’s grave which is around £1 500.

Their neighbour  who is a Leicester City Council tenant  had been using portable generators and it was one of these that had caught on fire which spread to Iqbal's home.     At home at the time were Iqbal's wife and four daughters aged 5-15yrs. Iqbal was at work when the fire broke out and rushed home as soon as he had heard what had happened.       The fire spread into Iqbal's home and the family was forced to evacuate into emergency accommodation. Unfortunately  the family did not settle well into the accommodation due to the overcrowding and stress the family was under. They left the emergency accommodation the following day due to stress and anxiety.      The family stayed with relatives for a couple of weeks in a one bed flat. They knew this was unsustainable with their large family however at least they felt safe. LCC informed their relative that the family couldn't stay any longer due to overcrowding and the family was forced to move out the following day.      The family sofa surfed for a few weeks until they were able to find a vacant property that they could just about afford to rent. The property they found needed a lot of work doing to it and Iqbal put his DIY skills to good use fixing up the property in return for reduced rent. However  it was still 4 months until the family managed to get hot water  heaters and to this day there is still no insulation in the walls.      The effect this has had on Iqbal's family is immense and the young children have been deeply affected by the trauma and chaotic living arrangements  overcrowding and lack of basic services. Iqbals eldest daughter is going through her GCSEs and this whole ordeal has really knocked her confidence and prevented her from focusing on her studies. Iqbals' eldest daughter has been diagnosed with psoriasis and her hair is falling out  doctors' have said this is a direct result of the stress of the fire and the subsequent house moves. The other children are also affected in many different ways.      As Iqbal's home was a private property which unfortunately had no insurance at the time the family is stuck in a real situation where they are unable to buy another home. Leicester City Council has offered to buy the land at less than a third of the market value as long as the family can raise the selling fees. Iqbal is still paying the mortgage and has no additional income or savings to cover the costs of repairs which have been estimated to be £35 000. The house that the fire originated in has now been fully repaired and refurbished by Leicester City Council  yet Iqbal's home is still in ruins and uninhabitable.      Iqbal and his family have been visiting a local food bank at E2 in Beaumont Leys to help them through their situation and have been knocked from pillar to post in their attempts to get this resolved with Leicester City Council which has recently come to a dead end.       If Iqbal was able to raise £35 000 it would mean that his family could get the repairs completed and move back into their home and their children can return to a sense of normality.  ",False

It keeps us safe.     As an intensive care doctor dealing with some of the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic I am massively in favour of anything that might keep us all safe. I have therefore been upset at the misinformation going out around oxygen levels and masks  as well as confused messaging on when to wear them (indoors!)     In another life (2019!) I was a triathlete and the pandemic has robbed me of much of my fitness. So to kill two birds with one stone I will run to and from work wearing a mask  and with an oxygen sats meter. I'll post photos (Twitter and Instagram  @LawtonTri). It's 8 miles each way  and if it's nice weather I'll make one of them a half marathon. In between runs  I will be looking after patients (some with COVID-19) and wearing a mask. If I can run 16-21 miles masked  you can probably make it round the shops.    Clearly this will entirely solve everything and put an end to debate on this issue.     I'm doing this in aid of the Trussell Trust  who operate food banks in Bradford and around the country - and have seen a massive increase in demand due to this horrendous virus.",False

Every week we take the money you have kindly donated to a cash and carry and buy  in bulk  what the four food banks we are working with have told us they desperately need. (See pics below). This is complemented by a weekly visit to the Felix Project where we load up with fresh fruit  veg  meat  eggs and cheese. All of this is delivered to community kitchens who cook up meals for those most in need in W10.    We are currently working with The Dalgarno Trust   Bay 20   The Space and The Tabernacle . All four of these charities provide meals  bags of shopping and many other support services to those experiencing food poverty in W10. Kensington and Chelsea boasts some of the highest net worth inhabitants but also has many pockets of severe deprivation – North Kensington is one of the deepest. A sobering fact to note is that 31.6% of children in this borough live in poverty.    Food banks we are working alongside unanimously concur that the demand for aid has tripled this year since the pandemic began. Help is needed more than ever. Every time we make a drop  the relief and joy the charities express is palpable and sums up how desperate the situation is.    All the money donated will be used to supply fruit  veg and essentials to those in need in North Kensington. Your financial donations will go entirely towards funding this food relief project. All staff  including Rima  Amanda  Maryam and the admin  safeguarding and marketing support team are volunteers.     Please share this page with anyone who might be interested in helping and please donate if you would like to help. A regular donation would make a huge difference  as food poverty is not going to go away.    Thank you for your invaluable support.    Rima  Maryam  Amanda and team.    How to contact us:  Email: [email redacted]  Instagram: stjohnscafe    Call Rima: 07891 078 647    Or Amanda 07956 282 858    How it started: In March when the pandemic closed the doors of Rima’s Café at the Playground Theatre  she and her son Mars created a GoFundMe page to raise money for a Covid19 food relief campaign. Over the course of 11 weeks  they raised £16 000. With the help of a team of local volunteers producing over 6000 meals  all of which were delivered to those most in need in the North Ken community.

Diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer in the lungs and bones.        Thank you for choosing to read this page.  I don't quiet know where to start  however I know I need to start  for my lovely mum.    Those of you who know Andrea will know she is an extremely kind  caring  funny and positive person  who works as a self employed psychotherapist and counsellor. Those of you who know us  will know me and my mum have always been the best of friends and are extremely close  so this news saddens me deeply.     My beautiful mum was diagnosed with Cancer for the very first time in 2006 when I was just 7 years old. This was Skin Cancer  she had to battle it and work at the same time  such a hard thing for a single mum with two young kids  but after treatment and ops at Christie's Cancer Centre she bravely recovered.     Only to be diagnosed again in 2015 with Breast Cancer Stage 2 a very difficult time for us all  I remember the difficulty  going through my GCSE's whilst caring for my mum physically and emotionally. Financially this time was challenging for us as a family  as my mum has always worked so hard to provide for my brother and I  without any financial support from fathers. When she was diagnosed  the ops and treatment on top of the emotional pain made it so she really struggled to work  but had no other choice. The financial strain was one of the most stressful elements of her illness  and this really shouldn't be the case when you're facing a life threatening illness. We accessed food banks to eat and didn't get to enjoy pleasurable things that normal families do  instead I remember having to spend my wages from my part time job on food for our family. This was an embarrassing time for my mum as a mother works all her life to provide for her family but Cancer takes this right away  she tried so hard  never once giving up or asking anyone for anything.     My mum has always been a big believer in spiritual  holistic and alternative therapies  so she chose not to take the Chemotherapy which the doctors strongly advised claiming she wouldn't live more than a few years if it was not taken. She braved this and stayed true to her beliefs and used holistic  complementary therapies and PMA. Thankfully she was given the all clear from Breast Cancer and she started working as a therapist after completing her degree whilst fighting the cancer  and has never looked back since  she has been nothing less than completely dedicated to her job and gives her all to her clients  ensuring they feel fully supported and cared for.    Those of you who know Andrea for whatever reason she may have come in to your life  I'm sure everyone has the same view of her - a beautiful  selfless  generous and truly strong  inspiring woman. A woman who remains so positive and selfless regardless of what life throws at her.    Jubba  my mums younger sister passed away of Cancer in November  my mum received her unfortunate results on just 2 weeks after. Therefore it is even more of a difficult time for her  and all the family.    My mum first lost her voice last in November 2017. After undergoing investigations she discovered half her vocal cords have become paralysed. This means  if you haven't heard her  her voice is barely a whisper and has been like this for over a year. This has made her job as a counsellor very strenuous. Just before this Christmas  in November 2018 mums year long investigations (biopsy)showed cancerous cell changes in the lungs and that the canceous cells from the Breast Cancer had spread and there is now cancer in the sternum (breast bone) and lower spine  as well as other scattered locations around the body. My mum  my brother and I sat through the dreaded meeting with the cancer specialists on 4th Jan 2019 which we had been thinking of all Christmas  to be told that mums now has Secondary breast cancer which is metastatic and in the lungs and bones. We tried to remain calm however to be told that the cancer is Stage 4 and if treatment is taken then life expectancy is on average 2 years but 5 years at maximum. I struggled to hold it together and broke down in tears. The thought of loosing my only parent and absolute best friend  who has worked so hard all her life to be such a good mum to me  at this young age devastates me.     The doctors spent hours emphasising the severity of this Cancer  and how essential treatment is  and fast. My mum was advised to take a high dosage of IV chemotherapy 2 years intense at Christies Cancer Centre however  she has always been very resistant to such strong conventional medicine and made clear that if she was going to be given 2 years to live  she'd rather live these years to the fullest and not ill  bedbound from such harsh treatment. We have decided as a family and with the doctors for my mum to start treatment which consists of a little less intense Chemotherapy and a specialised medicine herceptin this Friday 11th Jan which she has to take every 2 weeks and go to the hospital every 3 weeks.     Being a single mum she has a lot on her plate  the side effects of this treatment will really rid my mum of her ability to function as normal  and will even make daily tasks a challenge nevermind her full time work as a therapist. Such as breathlessness  dizziness  bruising  stinging  arthalgia  myaliga  insomnia  jaw pain  increased risk of serious infection  lethargy  sore mouth  nausea and vomiting  heartburn and serious energy loss. As you can imagine  trying to hold a full time job down which is essential to live and pay bills would be incredibly hard and virtually impossible.    SO I've decided to set up this page  without my mums awareness to help alleviate some of the constant stress that shouldn't be her main worry when suffering a life threatening terminal cancer.     The generous donations will be spent on things like mums transport to and from hospital (as she doesn't drive). I am hoping that your kind donations will be able to enable my mum to not have to burn herself out and work  as much as she loves her job  it is detrimental to her health  it kills me seeing her so emotionally and physically exhausted  without any other option. **Since donations have been so generous I am really encouraging my Mum to see less clients and spend her energy on her own health  but this is fully dependent on your generous donations  so thank you so much.**    The money will enable my mum to explore alternative therapies and treatment such as holistic treatment which is never funded by the NHS (I know she has a list of many things she'd like to try but simply can't afford). Complementary therapies  counselling so that she can discuss the pain and fear this painful news brings. My mum also used to attend yoga classes but she recently had to finish as she told me she has to cut out luxuries due to money being limited and only based on how much she can work  so I would love her to be able to afford these classes again to help her health. And lastly  the money would go towards trying to find anything she can to help  I know she'd love to eat nutritious healthy foods that will help build her immune system and fight.     Andrea is and always has been the most generous and selfless person  you won't catch her being able to receive gifts or money very easily at all  however she'll easily give you her favourite ring or jumper if she thinks it suits you and you like it! She wont think twice about dropping everything to be there for you if you need someone. And she's never changed.     *Due to such devastating news I have chosen to leave my degree at the University of York and come home to care for my lovely Mum  so do message me if you have any ideas or ways you could help support.*    I will be looking to put on a fundraising event to raise money for my Mum so please do be in touch if you can help/have ideas.     I appreciate you taking time to read this and any donation no matter how small will honestly be so appreciated.    Love  Grace x      ",False

The individual /individuals have taken tablets that were used for referrals to the fuel bank to enable those in crisis to receive an emergency payment and for a nationwide surveys into foodbank from Edinburgh university. They have taken our main hard drive /pc all are password protected . They have obviously ransacked the office and damaged our filing cabinets. Along side the items we need to replace   they have taken around £200 that was donated over the Christmas period which obviously provides much needed funds for the day to day running of the foodbank. Food was taken too  so we are putting an appeal out for tinned fish  rice pudding  tinned fish   tinned tomatoes and uht milk.   We as a charity can little afford the extra costs incurred to replace the more valuable items and office furniture. Any donations will be greatly received and used to help to wider community .      As stated our original target was £1000 and we have blown away by the generosity of the wider public. I am one of the merry band of volunteers at Oldham Foodbank. We offer assistance to those in crisis with food parcels for 3 days . As we have smashed our target   extra money raised will be used to enhance our current security systems to prevent ourselves from being targeted again . Furthermore the money raised will secure day to day expenses of the Foodbank for the foreseeable future   enabling us to continue to provide to those in need and crisis.   All monies raised is to be transferred to Oldham Foodbank bank account which is run by our Trustees.     Update on 17/5/19     We are in the process of withdrawing funds   The funds will be withdrawn via the manager of the Foodbank and promptly transferred to the Oldham Foodbank account which the Trustees will be able to allocate funds as we require them .   Once again Thank you   a photo showing the transfer and statement will be placed via this page for transparency.     ",False

Her beloved husband and two children are left to try and pick up the pieces whilst dealing with the heartache and financial burden in the wicked wake of this disease.     Janet was the most caring and selfless woman  always putting the needs of others before her own. She suffered from an autoimmune disease and asthma but despite this  she wanted to give to the community and help as many people as she could. During the first lockdown  Janet reached out to the local area - hand-delivering letters introducing herself  giving her contact details  and reassuring people she was there for them whether this was for an ear to listen  or if they needed support with getting shopping or medical prescriptions; she was there for everyone and anyone.    She has always been such a generous  charitable  and kind natured person  supporting and caring for everyone who came into her life – it was in her nature.     Before lockdown she regularly held MacMillan  coffee mornings and worked for the local council - working with deprived areas in the community as well as working in schools  raising awareness for children in poverty. Janet also supported many other charities including food banks and Christmas appeals. She was an active member in her local church  where she will be dearly missed.    Janet's act of kindness did not stop there as  at the age of 52  she went into fostering. She fostered two boys who lost their grandfather during the lockdown. Again  not thinking of herself but the children that had lost their family. She fostered the boys until she sadly passed away.    This page has been created to help raise awareness of the devastating impact covid-19 has on families and to support her family with the financial costs involved in her passing.

The Rev Mandy Brown and her team at Holy Trinity Church in South Street offer practical and emotional comfort and support to those in need.    It cost £28 000 to run the shelter last year. The tight budget means manager David Perry is employed for just 13 hours a week  but he dedicates many more to reaching out to homeless people as soon as the team become aware of their difficulties.    Rev Brown said: ""We are unable to open all year round because the number of volunteers we would need would be phenomenal. We would need a huge amount of money to pay a full-time manager and we just don't have it.""    However  with the help of up to 300 volunteers  they are able to offer a safe haven each night during the worst of the winter for up to 12 guests.    Rev Brown is anxious that the help offered is more than a temporary sticking plaster.    ""Once we open we will keep going to the end of March – we have a very long season  one of the longest [of any winter night shelter] "" she said.    ""Experience tells us that the worst of the bad weather comes later than it used to. But we use that time to be able to work with people and to help people connect and reconnect. We need the time to build up the trust and the love that's required to be able to work with someone.    ""Just providing a roof over somebody's head does not resolve the challenges they are facing. It's just the beginning. The shelter is a conduit to other resources – to housing  to drug and alcohol rehabilitation and even using the contact centre to reconnect people to their children and families "" she said. That support continues even when guests are off the street.    As part of its mission to provide the best possible services  the shelter is regularly inspected by Housing Justice and was rated 'excellent' at the last visit. ""We are very proud of that "" said Rev Brown. ""We work very closely with Housing Justice and we follow all their guidelines.""    Each day  the shelter  now a registered charity  needs two overnight volunteers each night  three lunchtime and four evening helpers  plus an extra pair of hands during the day to collect food donated by businesses. Those who can spare just a few hours to play cards or board games or just chat are very welcome.    David said: ""You don't have to know how to resolve someone's issues – just come and be a friend.""    He is training volunteers who have already come forward but is anxious to recruit more and set up induction sessions for them too.    Not all roles are client-facing – the shelter also needs help with laundry  housekeeping  pantry stock rotation and preparing meals on the premises each evening. New recruits to the catering crew have been busy securing food hygiene certificates.    Rev Brown said: ""It's wonderful to come in out of the cold and for the guests to smell home-cooked meals coming out of the kitchen.""    The shelter's doors open each night from 8pm and guests leave at 7.30am  unless the weather is particularly bad. Lunch is on offer from 11am until 2pm. The shelter offers activities such as art therapy as well as advice on issues including mental health and addiction.    Over the past five years  since the shelter first opened  the team have built up a wealth of practical experience and a network of experts who can help address the complex issues which lead to an individual living on the streets.    They work closely with Citizens Advice  Bishop's Stortford Food Bank at the Methodist church  alcohol and drug rehabilitation professionals and East Herts Council's housing options officer for rough sleepers.    The team also partner with other churches  such as the Salvation Army  which provides vouchers so shelter-users can pick their own clothes from the good cause's shop in South Street.    David has a small selection of garments so that anyone turning up in wet clothes can change into something dry  warm and clean  but because space is tight  the shelter is unable to store donations of clothes  which are best directed to the town's charity shops.    The shelter has ample supplies of towels and beddings and uses special fold-up beds  which can be cleaned easily.    It does  however  always welcome donations of tea  coffee and biscuits  which are always in short supply  plus books and games for the guests.    Rev Brown said: ""The shelter has galvanised the community to meet what is an increasingly challenging issue for everybody. We could not do this without the support of the town.""",False

Now is a time to come together and help support members in our society that need it. With this in mind  we wanted to make our own contribution in tackling the repercussions of this devastating virus.     We (Amy Turner) and (Angharad James) are both professional footballers at Manchester United and Reading respectively. On Friday 1st May 2020  we will be completing a ‘stay at home bike challenge’ that will consist of cycling the distance from Sheffield (Amy’s hometown) to Pembrokeshire (Angharad’s hometown) in less than 24 hours.    Together this will be a total of 383km. We are not expert cyclists by any means and probably don’t know what we are letting ourselves in for but we are determined to help make a difference. In the absence of fixtures at the moment  we will be completing 90-minute relays each throughout the ride to replicate the duration of matches      We are hoping to raise a significant amount of money for two charities in Sheffield; IDAS (Independent Domestic Abuse Services) and The Hub Food Bank. And two charities from Pembrokeshire; GTBAL (Get the boys a lift) and Cardigan Food Bank.     IDAS is a specialist charity in Yorkshire supporting anyone who has experience of or is affected by domestic abuse and/or sexual violence. The Hub Food Bank and Cardigan Food Bank supply urgent food for families in crisis. GTBAL is a community-based charity that supports those dealing with mental health issues.    All four charities are organisations that are very close to our hearts and are in need of support in these difficult times. All contributions made will make a huge difference and will go a long way in helping lots of people in our hometowns and surrounding areas.     We would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for your donations  and TOGETHER we can help tackle this.",False

About 200 per week. I cook the meals with love and care and it is a privilege to be able to do so.     I began by wanting to help NHS and Care Home staff during the first Covid 19 lockdown in March 2020. So far I have cooked 0ver 5000 meals that I have made as delicious  pretty and nutritional as possible. I have also made sure they can be safely frozen and defrosted and can be re-heated in a microwave.     After 2 periods of self-isolation I started cooking from home on the 24th of April 2020 for the staff at my local care home  an NHS critical care nurse and a weeks worth of meals for an 89 year old I've been cooking for since he lost his wife years ago.     I have moved from 52 meals to a maximum of 206 on January 11 2021 and I am averaging about 200 per week at the moment (April 2021 ) I keep some meals in my freezer so that if anyone has a tough shift  they can contact me and I can give them a home-cooked meal to go home with. I spend 14 hours or so every Wednesday cooking for carers and will continue to do so for as long as I can; hopefully the rest of my life. The NHS has looked after me and my kids brilliantly and I want to give back.     I am utterly inspired by the NHS  Community Centre and Care Home Staff I meet. They make me want to be kinder  work harder and just be better.     My ultimate goal is to do this by teaching kids how to do the cooking with so that there is a double and ever growing benefit. But for now  I want to feed people and make their lives a little bit easier. I want them to be able to rely on a meal from me every Wednesday or Thursday.    Giving one person a wonderful meal means something. Donating is the same. I can make a little go a long way because I am brilliantly supported by Leathams for many ingredients  Nodene from Shands Cakes for Cakes  Ken Watts for eggs that go to Nodene to make the cakes  Val  Ian and Sue for the containers and 2000 portions so far of Swiss Chard from my Garden. 100% of the donations I receive will go towards buying ingredients  serving vessels  I have also bought protective gloves and a £50 freezer to be able to store more ingredients and meals.

I started this with around 3k of my own money and have input funds ever since. Food packages are for those in food poverty  struggling financially  on furlough and similar emergency situations. I have also been topping up electric + gas for those in emergency situations. I am in contact with food banks  supermarkets & various other organisations to ensure there is no food wasted.   Food packages include a mixture of fresh fruit and vegetables  tinned foods  pasta  rice   toiletries  cleaning products and other essentials. I want to ensure that the food in these packages are healthy and what we would all wish to eat  not just peoples unwanted items.    Over 3350 households have recieved food packages. This has been funded by myself alongside this fundrasier to keep it going as long as possible.If you are in a positon to donate anything please do!   Funding will be used buy food  to create more packages and ensure no one has to go hungry  any building costs or those associated with the project! All volunteers do so for free  those delivering do not recieve any finances for doing so. In the long term I hope funding will allow me to open a hub where people can come and collect food and where more food can be stored. I want to continue hosting more educational workshops on finance and budgeting with those in our community to change their life situations for the long term.     Those in emergency situations are also be able to access and small top up of electircy/gas to keep their house warm and functional.     Food poverty is real and going on behind closed doors. Please do not suffer in silence.     If you know anyone struggling just message me! https://www.facebook.com/groups/702016074038325/?ref=share  * I am raising funds for this project personally as I started it with my own money - not for a charity or as a charity representative* I am currently exploring long term options for a CIC  chairty or other options. This is dependant on how the project goes.* (the process is long so please be patient) ",False

We’re raising money in aid of HUMANS MCR and every donation will help. As trainee teachers  we know that it is more than likely that some of the children we are teaching will be reliant on food banks. No child should ever go hungry  and it is never their fault. Any donation is greatly appreciated! Thank you.",False

Update: 3rd March  2021    Another interview with The Independent  describing the struggle to survive on Universal Credit and my fears about the cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/budget/budget-universal-credit-20-pounds-b1811750.htmlTaking this opportunity to thank everyone for their ongoing support - you are wonderful and I couldn't do this without you.   .  .  .      Update: 19th January  2021 I've been interviewed by The Independent about the catastrophic consequences of the upcoming Universal Credit cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/b1789040.html      .  .  .        My original message: 30th August  2019    This is incredibly difficult for me to write  but I need to ask my friends  acquaintances and perhaps even some people whom I don’t know  to help me get through the next few months.    I am a domestic abusive survivor struggling to meet essential living costs and the situation is going to escalate rapidly because my employer is deducting more than 25% of my pay from September onwards  to recover two overpayments they made in error for a really long time  without me or payroll noticing.    I’m already on a low income and have been trying to find a more stable job. Until now I’ve been working two jobs  but the temporary one is coming to an end and I will only have my permanent part-time job – where they have persistently tried to dismiss me on health grounds so aside from the overpayment recovery  I just can’t hold on there for much longer.    Whenever I do give my notice or get dismissed  they’ll take the entirety of my final month’s pay.    I live alone but the person I used to cohabit with left substantial utility bill debts at our home that I didn’t become aware of until later  since they lied about having cleared balances. There’s not enough space to move another person in  and I can’t move out right now for financial and contractual reasons.    Because of an active police investigation for rape and domestic abuse that I can’t go into  I’ve already borrowed money for unexpected costs like home security  numerous phone calls to charities and agencies offering professional advice  and private therapy which unfortunately I had to quit.    My chronically poor health has dramatically worsened – I’ve been to a&e twice in the past fortnight because of a kidney infection that didn’t respond to treatment and I had to pawn things to pay for my ongoing prescriptions  but there’s not much of value left for me to sell.    I need to wear glasses but have been doing without for several months since they broke; I’m doing without a lot of things. One of my cats needs dental surgery soon but this isn’t going to be possible.    I earn slightly too much to claim benefits or get free prescriptions and despite years of hospital referrals  I am still fighting for a diagnosis to explain my physical health problems so I’m not currently eligible for any support that could be claimed.    Unfortunately I’m estranged from my parents and I don’t have regular contact with any other family.    I don’t have savings and I wouldn’t realistically be able to repay any further money borrowed.    Up to this point I’ve managed to keep on top of the rent and buy cat food but I have now begun going without my own food  even before overpayment recovery has started. I’m hoping to access a food bank next week but the period I can use them for will be limited.    It’s hard to put a figure on how much help I should ask for  since the only real solution is me finding a job where they’re not actively trying to dismiss me for my chronic health problems  but I am hopeful that if I can just get straight with the money I already owe and raise a couple of months’ living expenses to buy myself time whilst finding a better job  then I can make things work.

Whilst children in poverty should not have to rely on charity to be able to eat  until politicians can sort this mess out  an immediate solution is needed to support pandemic hit families currently faced with empty cupboards.     This is more than a political issue  this is a deeply human issue; as a Mum it is an utterly unbearable thought that right now parents are standing in front of an empty cupboard  knowing that they can't feed their kids.    Think about that for a moment. It's a truly terrible thought.    This is not something I can stand by and watch without doing something.    As the founder of a community of 100k Mums  it feels like we CAN do something together to make a difference in the short term at least.    We have a chance to give whatever we can to provide urgently needed help to our most needy families.     All money raised will go directly to FairShare  the UK’s longest running food redistribution charity. They have seen demand for food skyrocket  particularly among frontline organisations providing food to children and their families. With the coronavirus pandemic pushing thousands of people into financial hardship  and the government's recent decision  many more families will struggle to put food on the table.    They urgently need help to deliver more healthy  nutritious food to the food banks  community groups  activity schemes and schools supporting the UK’s most vulnerable children during this crisis.      Every £1 could provide four meals for children in need. Our goal is to raise £5000 which could provide 20 000 meals to children in need.    Many of you already support this  or other similar organisations - you are wonderful  thank you.

We have been supporting those who are living in poverty or struggling under austerity since our inception in 2016. We help the homeless  refugees  the elderly and anyone who needs a little help or support in their lives.  We have a small charity shop in the Basford area of Nottingham and have very recently opened a small coffee shop which helps combat hunger.     We recieve no funding and no Grant's and rely heavily on the support of our local community. Now many of those who have been there for us and countless strangers over the past years need our...and your help.    The elderly who have been our lifeline are now  in many cases in isolation. They are struggling financially and struggling to get out and get the supplies they need to be able to fight the Covid 19.  We have people in their latter years struggling for food. A lady of 92 who for the first time in her life is looking for charity and needs help to access a food bank.  I'm both heartbroken and appalled that life has come to this for her and many like her.  Can you help us to help her?    Our action plan is to rally those in the community that are physically able to help us. We are hoping to raise enough money to supply hundreds of elderly and disabled people in Nottingham with an emergency care parcel.    We already have a small food bank but it is nearly depleted of supplies.  Can you donate some tea bags? Milk or eggs? A jar of jam or a much loved treat of a bar of chocolate?  Each bag will contain essentials  tinned veg  soup and a pack of biscuits. Toilet rolls (yes we can get them but they cost money)...a bar of soap or a card to say 'hello  your loved by a stranger'.    I realise that this fundraiser will be read by many of you who are not in Nottingham or have any links to this city.  However those in need are our fellow human beings  they could be your gran  your great aunt Edith or that school teacher that you loved in secondary school. The soldier that stood for you in a foreign land.    Every penny will be appreciated  every penny accounted for.     Thank you for reading thus far and thank you for your support.

We urgently need your help to pay for the food costs. Any money you can give will be a fantastic gesture to support people most at need now.     Harissa Kitchen  part of the Newcastle upon Tyne based Food Nation social enterprise CIC (03169228)  is launching a free meals service for vulnerable people living in Byker  Walker  Sandyford  Ouseburn and Heaton  coordinated through the Newcastle City Council’s Citylife Line service to ensure the people most at need get the help.     All vulnerable people in the household will receive 6 days food each week  delivered on Monday  Wednesday and Friday consisting of a breakfast pot  soup and an evening meal. Weekends will also see a special treat of a cake added to the meal. We are expecting to initially serve up 540 free meals a week – and will look to expand this to 900 each week as referrals come through. We are anticipating providing at least 9 900 free meals to people that need the most help over the next three months.    The following people will be provided with support:    · Older people living alone with no other support network; who can’t leave the house due to mobility issues or are self-isolating due to health conditions but haven’t been sent an NHS letter and therefore not eligible for emergency food parcels; or who have no access to internet or cannot order online.  · Families who are self-isolating with virus symptoms with no other support system  have low or no income or can’t get a delivery slot for food.    Some people are in need of ongoing help whilst others need one-off support whilst waiting for delivery slots with supermarkets or for newly unemployed to receive benefits. No one else is offering this support to these isolated people at this scale.     The food is being prepared by trained chefs for free and will provide a varied and nutritionally balanced meals. Food will be delivered by volunteers in re-heatable containers. All food preparation and delivery will fully comply with the Government’s Covid-19 food and safety and working standards.    We are looking for funding to pay for food and volunteer travel costs. The cost for providing this service is £5 a day for one person. Food Nation receives some grant support from Newcastle City Council  but this will not cover the cost of the food or delivery. Volunteer drivers where needed will be able to claim 45p a mile expenses. Where possible we are sourcing reduced cost or donation food to reduce costs.     The cost of providing the food over 3 months is £16 500. We are also applying to local grant funders for help - but this takes time and people need our help now. The more money we raise  the more people we can help.     Food Nation is a well-respected social enterprise (CIC 03169228) that has been working with families and some of the poorest communities in Newcastle upon Tyne  helping them to make healthy food choices and improve their wellbeing. As part of this – we have run a popular community restaurant Harissa Kitchen serving great quality and nutritionally balanced food  whose profits went back into supporting our wider work. Due to the coronavirus situation  we can no longer keep our restaurant open and our premises are not suitable for takeaways.    Please donate to help as we’ve started to receive urgent referrals now. We know times are hard for everyone – but for the people we will support it will really be a lifeline.    · £5 will pay for a days food for a vulnerable person  · £30 will pay for a weeks food for one person    The people identified have no support networks to help them  and are struggling now. This service will provide a much needed short term lifeline. Requests already received include:    - 'I'm visually impaired and autistic. I also have depression  anxiety and Diabetes Type 2. I'm having difficulties getting medication and food and can't get an online delivery slot.'  - 'Me and my 9yr old daughter both have symptoms of COVID 19 and need to self isolate. I need help to get food. I have financial difficulties and am struggling to manage as my next Universal Credit isn't due until 14th April. I don't have enough money to pay for my gas and electric.'  'She has no food at home and has a young daughter and I feel she needs priority. She does not receive any benefits and relies solely on food banks.'    Food Nation are also providing a ‘Food Nation Friend’ befriending service for isolated people and food shopping service for people who can cook but cannot leave the house. They are also linking people into wider support and ensuring they have access to advice and support networks to combat isolation including their newly remodelled Virtual Tuesday Lunch Club.

I would like to try and raise £100 for my local food bank. When I was shopping with my mum we noticed that the food bank box by the door in the supermarket only had a few things in it and it made me feel sad. I told my mum I wanted to help get some food for babies children and families who need it  so we thought I could do a virtual bike ride from my house all the way to Chester Zoo and ask people to sponsor me. It is a long way from my house. I will ride 50km altogether. Once I get there I am going to do a virtual tour of the zoo! With the money I raise cycling to Chester Zoo I am going to buy as much as I can to help so that families will have lots of food and things that they need. I am very excited to help. ",False

We fund locally owned cafes and restaurants to provide families most in need with a good meal. By doing this we are not only providing urgent support to desperate families but also supporting businesses most affected by the COVID pandemic.     Due to COVID people are losing their jobs  businesses are closing and there has been a significant increase in food poverty in the UK. Families are sacrificing food to pay their bills. The Trussell Trust have predicted that there will be a 61% increase in food bank use alone this winter and this doesn't even consider the social impact of poverty on children and families.     Every penny raised will go directly to feeding families with meals provided by local businesses. We have no overheads during the trial phase so everything you donate will go directly to providing food to families and children in real need of a meal. The trial phase will begin as soon as we can feed one family and we hope  with your support  to feed 100!     For just £5 you can feed a child a two course meal in a warm  welcoming environment. For another £5 you can feed their brother or sister a further £7  their parent(s) too. Please help us to provide these children and their families with food and human connection during these trying times.     Your donation will help us add to the growing network of food aid in the UK  help us do what the government can't and work towards ending hunger poverty!     Thank you for your support  we will keep you updated.     The Hungry Minds Team",False

This year has hit everyone hard. So many families  couples and single people are not looking forward to an enjoyable Christmas. Thankfully  with the help of the Cleckheaton Food Bank  Christmas will hopefully be a nicer time for them. I recently set up the Cleckheaton Virtual Christmas Market 2020 on Facebook after the real market had to be cancelled. This is to allow local businesses to showcase their goods  and so shoppers had one easy place to find what they were looking for. I’m not usually involved in the Christmas Market  but I do know their event each year raised funds for the town’s beautiful Christmas lights. With all this in mind  I have set up this GoFundMe to raise funds for both the food bank and the Christmas lights fund  so the stallholders and shopper in the group  and whoever else who wants to  can donate to these great causes. I know times are hard  but even £1 helps!! Please give what you can  and thank you everyone for getting involved. Merry Christmas ❤️",False

To summarize  I lost my Dad to Leukemia 4 years ago and a year later my Mom was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer. I quit my job to care for her fulltime and she died in my arms 11 months later. What an honour and privilege it was to comfort my best friend as she took her final breath. I miss her every day with a constant ache in my heart.    A few months later  my 20 year marriage ended in divorce and so  my 3 sons and myself decided to leave Cape Town and move to the UK. We LOVE it here. The beauty of the English countryside brings so much peace  tranquility and serenity to my soul.    In February last year  I was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer and my operation at Lister Hospital was the day before lockdown began. After 10 months of chemotherapy  radiation and bone infusions  I am cancer free for now  but need to continue treatment and deal with the lingering side effects.    I lost my job at the end of July due to the effects of COVID-19 on the business  and because I have had to isolate with the cancer treatment  have been unable to find alternative employment. Until now that is. Whoop whoop. I have an amazing job offer which is secure  but I can only start once lockdown is lifted and the company is working back at the premises around mid to late February.    As I am here on an Ancestral Visa I have no recourse to public funds and McMillans  other charities and food banks are helping as much as they can. I have survived these 6 months through my savings and the donations and kindness of so many on my previous GoFundMe account.    My last hurdle is the next month and not being able to pay my rent or other monthly expenses and this is where I am appealing once again to your caring  generous and compassionate souls.    It is so hard to have to keep asking and I have had to learn a lot about my pride. Giving is so much easier than receiving. I just want to be able to provide for my boys  work hard as we South African woman do and have some degree of stability after a really challenging year. I pray that soon I will be able to give back and love those around me in the same way that you have loved and cared for myself and my boys.    Original appeal: (August 2020)    My name is Cara Rayner and I came to live in the UK with my boys just under a year ago. I was diagnosed with advanced stage breast cancer which had spread to the lymph nodes in February of this year. My surgery was a day before lockdown began and 8 weeks later  the chemotherapy sessions started  which will be followed by radiation therapy. The chemotherapy has been aggressive and relentless  but a Mama will do anything for her children  so I am fighting with everything in me.    Unfortunately  due to COVID-19  the company I worked at could no longer keep me on  so my employment ended at the end of July 2020. I am still shielding and have another two months of treatment left. Although I can interview for positions  I cannot work until November. As a single Mom  my savings are very low and I need to cover rent  monthly accounts and food for myself  but more importantly  my boys. As I am here on an Ancestral Visa  I do not have recourse to public funds. The NHS and McMillans Cancer Centre have been brilliant with their care  compassion and in helping me find solutions to the various problems experienced with cancer.    I lost my Dad to leukemia 4 years ago and my Mom to colon cancer 2 years ago. This was followed 6 months later by my divorce after a 20 year long marriage. All this prompted our move to the UK for a fresh start and exciting opportunities. I am humbly requesting assistance to get through the next few months with a focus on healing and being able to provide for my family. I am in love with the UK. The ever changing countryside brings me great peace and contentment. My faith in God is strong and He has always come through for me on every front.    Update (September 2020):I am completely humbled and blessed and honoured and overwhelmed by all this support. I did post an update on Facebook about my last chemo session for now. Thank you so much for helping me and my boys and for giving me a sense of peace about the next two months. We have a roof over our head and food and my bills could get paid. As a Mom there is no greater gift. And YOU each made that all possible. I am eternally grateful for each and every pound and the beautiful hearts that blessed me and my boys so much. Thank you thank you.",False

Oaks recently heard that family’s local in Burnley and surrounding areas are struggling and without food to feed their children. He didn’t want children to go without food so he wanted to raise some money to buy some food which he will deliver to them.. via the food bank at St Matthews Church Burnley.

Community Fitness can be anything from a Zumba Fitness class in your community centre  to a small walking group  to Pilates in the local primary school. Fitness can have such a huge impact on a community and helps build one. Besides the obvious fitness benefits  it also build social circles  removes barriers  and looks after mind and body.      In 2019  the campaign supported over 380 food banks and saw a huge 125 000 meals donated by instructors all around the Country. 2020 has a mission of 500 000 meals and we need your help to make that happen!    Participants can donate food hampers instead of physically delivering tins to classes at a time where contact is limited and the supply chain needs to be kept as short as possible.",False

The United Grace Charity is so excited to be hosting a Christmas Dinner for the Homeless during the Christmas Period this year. Homelessness is on a increase. There is a huge deprivation in services within the Islington North Borough that provide effective services and help to the needs of the Homeless and vulnerable people and whilst we offer a Food Bank service for them  we decided to take it a step further and offer them a feast fit for a king and queen this Christmas.     Whilst many of us are creating Christmas lists and running around looking for the best presents for our loved ones  we tend to forget the many homeless people who are sat on the roadside hoping that £1 will drop from our pockets to get a cup of tea or a family that is at risk of an eviction causing family and relationship breakdown or take it a step further  a family that has only enough to just buy a gift for their children to keep a smile on their face that they will be eating cereal as a meal this Christmas.     United Grace Charity will be hosting a Christmas Dinner for the homeless and vulnerable families for the Islington North community and those across London on the 19th December 2015 at 3pm. Christmas dinner will be provided for over 100 homeless people. As well as providing a full Christmas style dinner  the facility will be decorated and those attending will receive a present (shoebox size)  with such items as toiletries  hat  socks and gloves. The dinner is cooked and served by our local community volunteers  called the United Grace Community Angels.    On the 20th of December 2015  we will be visiting the Lennox Care Home  a elderly residential home where gifts will be distributed also and Christmas provisions donated so that they can enjoy a Christmas Dinner also.     We are asking for just £10 to reserve a seat for a homeless person today! Your generosity will change a life. Let's turn this vision into a reality.     What will my £10 donation do?     Your generous donation of £10 will first and foremost reserve a place for a homeless person.  Secondly  it will provide three course nutritious hot meals including a full Christmas Dinner.   Thirdly  prominent key note speakers in the community and MP's (Jeremy Corbyn  David Lammy  Cllr Richard Greening Representatives of whittington hospital) offering advice and insight from a parliamentary viewpoint will be present including expert advice on life changing issues like housing and employment.   Fourth  an opportunity to change their clothes and hairdressing upon request.   Fifth  a gift (shoebox size) to take away.   Lastly and more importantly  creating a lasting friendship.     Give generously and let's awaken hope and illuminate love to the homeless this Christmas. Be a part of an incredible and life changing annual event. You won't be disappointed.

We are continuing to support these families in term time and the holidays.     £50 raised will be able to feed 25 young people    £100 raised will be able to feed 50 young people    £1000 raised will be able to feed 500 young people     There is power in our community. Join us.        Food provision through schools and youth clubs play an essential role in providing food for children and families who are in need of it - this is especially true during the holidays  when Free School Meals (FSM) are not usually available. Recently  the government (after several U-turns) decided to extend funding for FSM over the school holidays  but several families received substandard food packages that still forced them to rely on extra aid from food banks and mutual aid community groups.    Many young people are also not entitled to free school meals during term time because their parents earn above the amount allowed for eligibility for free school meals. In England  earnings from employment must be less than £16 190 for families in receipt of Child Tax or Working Tax Credits  and only £7 400 per year for families in receipt of Universal Credit.     This is staggeringly low and  when combined with measures such as the two child limit on Universal Credit payments  means that many families struggling to put food on the table are nevertheless deemed ineligible for free school meals. Other families are unable to claim FSM for their children because they have no recourse to public funds (NPRF) which is a condition the government imposes on some families due to their immigration status.      What does this mean?    Those recently impacted by the financial costs of COVID-19 (which are only increasing)  are more likely to go hungry. This will have bothphysiological and psychological impacts on young people and their families.     Why?    The data collected by CPAG on child poverty in the UK are enraging: 4.2 million children were living in poverty in the UK in 2018-19  out of which 700 000 were in London. This has been worsened by the fact that parents and carers are twice as likely to lose their jobs due to the pandemic.     In Lewisham  according to Trust for London   37% of children are in a situation of food insecurity  and 14% of the population needs social benefits to survive. It's deeply distressing that this level of inequality exists in the UK  particularly given that we are one of the richest countries in the world.     Don’t know what living with food insecurity feels like? See here .    The figures above reflect the shocking inequality in Britain  which was already severely impacting children and young people before the worst financial effects caused by the pandemic began to be felt. Due to the government’s lackluster response to the pandemic  it is projected that the number of children in poverty will increase to 5.2 million by 2022.     We also cannot ignore that this impact has not been distributed equally: people coming from Communities of Colour and immigrant background are over twice as likely to live in hardship than their white British counterparts and  due to the wider structural racial injustices  these communities are also disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. We are certainly not 'all in this together'.      What are we doing about it?     Legendary Community Club  which was named by Chevrington Odoh from the Pro Plus FC   is a grassroots project set up by some members of Lewisham Mutual Aid in partnership with local organisations. Our aim is to deliver emergency food provision to ensure that young people do not go without out  for as long as there is a need.       We will make this happen in three ways:    1. Temporary food provisions have been set-up for families who require this support  in partnership with local schools and community groups.    2. A kitchen has been set up to prepare nutritionally balanced meals for young people through their youth clubs which run after school and in the school holidays.    We know that food charity is not a long term solution. This is not the world we want to live in and we refuse to normalise food banks as a solution to food poverty. This is NOT an inevitable situation.    3. With this in mind  we will continue to work alongside The Children's Society  who have been calling on the government to ensure that every local council adequately funds emergency support for families   so that nobody is left behind in a time of crisis. For more information about their campaign 'Strengthening the Safety Net' see here   and sign the petition here.    We will also continue to support the calls from Save the Children and Child Poverty Action Group who have been lobbying for reforms to the benefits system  as well as an increase in the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit by £20  and an end to the two child limit and the £20 000 a year benefit cap which hits families in high-rent areas such as Lewisham particularly hard. Lastly  we will continue to support IFAN with the #CashFirst campaign  which has already inspired us to start our very own community-led participatory research project (stay tuned for more on this!).     The way our tax and welfare system is designed is a political choice. There are solutions . We will call on the government and its representatives to be bold  brave and radical in how they approach this problem.       What will we use the funds for?      We will use the money raised from the community to buy food and equipment for the project.    We have a host of volunteers  and multiple clubs and schools signed up and ready to go.

Businesses and families coming together in so many ways to help provide a good meal for our people. The true sense of community and a nation united and agreeing to understand that no matter what our personal circumstances are we can all do something to help and there could not be a better cause than our future generations chances of a decent education and life.    Me and my mum were helped many times throughout my childhood from volunteer workers  food banks  homeless housing  free school meals and many other services which were available to us. We still struggled. It scares me to think what some parents would be forced to put themselves through to make sure their child gets a meal. it scares me to think where i would be if i did not have these services available.    This is me wanting to do my bit  inspired by the amazing efforts from our entire nation  while struggling ourselves  still giving back.    We want to raise 50 THOUSAND POUNDS!!!! Every single penny will be split across local foodbanks and help services in need around greater Manchester.    What a feeling it will be to deliver such help to the most deserving people.    Please. we need 10.000 5ers     thats it! please share  please actually ask people and make them aware.    no child should go hungry.",False

The fall off in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that we have had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased our costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries.

The virtual market launched in May 2020 following tremendous support from kind donors. www.localheroes.fadne.org. This initiative is currently completely self-funded and is being built from the grassroots up with the help a number companies  organisations and individuals with experience in storage  logistics  distribution  transport and digital technology who are all eager to see it succeed. So far  the initiative has been a huge success; 120 + orders 180 + boxes 80% + of suppliers have received orders. Our 10% 'Community Fund' has enabled us to deliver 1200 local eggs and 200 litres of fresh  local milk to the West End Food Bank. Currently delivering within a 5 mile radius of Newcastle  we are now looking to extend and deepen our reach by establishing a Local Heroes distribution hub in the Tees Valley. We need your incredible support once again to help us ensure that the 'new normal' includes a critical role for local  community driven food and drink. We will need to raise £4000 if we are to make this a reality. That would take our total to £10 000 which would be an incredible achievement A Tees Valley hub will also allow us to broaden the impact of our Community Fund to assist those in need south of the region.

One such couple are my brother and sister in law have had to close their snack bar due to government restrictions because of covid 19. This was their only source of income as well as a much loved family business  built by my late dad and brother for the last 20  plus years. I’d say the van is a bit of a fife icon - being down the prom in Kirkcaldy  Highland games and most recently in Randolph industrial estate. This business means the world to my brother and he is absolutely devastated to have had to cease trading  particularly so soon after losing our Dad. As well as the business suffering  Chris has also suffered some pretty difficult health issues this year which has really knocked him for six  making dealing with this even more emotional and challenging. For those of you who know my brother personally  you’ll all know what a big heart he has and how much he helps anyone who needs it. He’s helped out local food banks and raised money for lots of charities over the years and now he is the one who needs a bit of help. The van has been off the road for sometime now and is in urgent need of repair. Let’s keep the pie guy and his snack bar open! Every little would be so greatly appreciated.   Thanks ",False

But it's a slightly different one so I'd be really grateful if you could have a quick read and  if you're able to  make a donation to help provide some Light During Lockdown to the kids who need it.     On Monday 20th April most children in the UK would have been going back to school to start the summer term. With the whole country in lockdown due to COVID-19 and no end to this currently in sight  it is expected that kids will miss at least a few weeks of school  if not half a term or possibly even a full term. The schools have all been amazing in sending out resources and setting up online learning but not all children are able to access these  or have supplies at home to be able to continue their learning  or even keep themselves entertained  during lockdown.    With many families now facing financial difficulties  it is not possible for all children to get supplies such as reading books  stationery  craft supplies and workbooks. We are aiming to raise funds to put together packs of key resources for kids who need them to make sure that they can continue their education and  more importantly  find things to keep them entertained during this ongoing lockdown period. We are working with the Potters Bar Food Bank who will distribute these packs to any families that need them.     We are grateful for any donation and appreciate your support in what is a difficult time for everyone. Your donation will go towards making sure that kids are supported during lockdown and they are still able to find outlets through play  reading and writing.    Please spread the word – all donations are gratefully received and if you know of any other food banks that would be willing to distribute these packs in their local area  please let us know via the message function below and we will be in touch.

With no football   social events or meetings in the club house  sadly means no income  but still lots of expenditure due to utility costs.  With no date of when we can reopen and return to normality we are reaching out to our local community  members and friends for some support.  Buckingham Athletic is a community club and as most people are aware it has been the hub for the Emergency Food Bank recently.

Covid has affected us all but it has hit parts of our community harder than others.     We carried on the amazing work that St Barnabas Primary School began with a 'Community Food Share'  providing food and essential items to local families in this time of need.     We currently support families within the BS2 and surrounding areas  100% of your donations helps us maintain our resources to provide a varied weekly package.     Job security is becoming less stable as the furlough scheme tapers out  gig economy workers can find less work and self employed people are also facing uncertainty  there is still a further need to do more and support people at this time.     We stand together and bridge the gap with this amazing and unified part of Bristol.        Thank you.

GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw Since We Care was launched as the UK's largest independent food bank and advice and support hub in Lewisham in 2014  we have always ensured that  during school holidays and Christmas  children and the hungry families they come from do not have to worry about putting food on the table. This half term  however  and over this coming Christmas  we truly need your help to feed the new wave of people and pets from across London who are in crisis and will be coming through our doors this winter at Kath's Place  50 Friendly Street  Deptford SE8 4DR.    Can you imagine losing up to 40% of your monthly income? That is the reality for so many people in the present crisis. Rents are so high in our area that people in work do not have enough cash to pay the rent and  probably for the first time in their lives  are having to trade a visit to their local coffee shop for a visit to the We Care Food Bank and Food Pantry for help  advice  support and solidarity. Embarrased and even ashamed  but even more desperate and distraught that their kids are going hungry  mums tell us that they can go days without food  and  on average  it takes people at least a week of going hungry before they finally come through our doors and ask for help. We really do need your donation this Christmas GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw . Becasue we help everyone and anyone and do not focus on one particular group (such as refugees or the homeless) we get absolutely NO national or local government funding or any other type of funding.

At around 1.15pm on Monday 27th April  Peter was robbed of £2 500 cash in Lidl car park  after leaving the Halifax Bank in Denton. The money was earmarked to purchase a replacement car to enable him to continue with his voluntary work which  during the current COVID-19 pandemic  includes collecting food & medical packages from local residents for distribution to vulnerable members of the community from the food bank in Haughton Green.    The crime was witnessed by several shoppers  and also caught on CCTV. The Police have been informed.     Peter also transports people to & from their appointments at Tameside General Hospital. Away from volunteering & entertaining  he is a a regular visitor to Denton St Lawrence Cricket Club  both to watch the cricket and attend social events at the Club. So  in one way or another  he is a familiar face in the local area.    Everyone at DSL is appalled that this crime should happen at ANY time in our community  let alone during the current health crisis. We’re asking for donations  however small  to help to re-imburse Peter.    Thank you!",False

This vital local resource has seen an overwhelming increase in demand since the onset of COVID-19. In April alone   the Community Fridge provided vital ‘food support ‘ to over 500 families across West Lothian.           These families are facing real ‘gut wrenching ‘ hardship and the Community Fridge has seen an unprecedented demand for the vital support they provide . This is a difficult time for everyone in society but some families are facing the daily challenge of accessing food and supplies for their children and the most vulnerable in our local community . It is no exaggeration to say they are quite literally relying on food banks like the Community Fridge to survive.           John and Grant are local boys who truly understand the area and the daily challenges and choices local families are facing and how these challenges have been further amplified by this pandemic.           Their personal and professional ethos is unselfishly about helping others   providing support and a ‘helping hand’ wherever they can. The thought of vulnerable families and young children going without access to food saddens and terrifies them . Through ‘More Than Fitness’ they’ve routinely provided support to the fridge. Over the last 3 months they’ve put on ‘food bank bootcamps’   free online classes for companies in return for a food bank donations and much more . However   they both realise this current situation requires a much bigger effort and response .           So   these extraordinary times and the associated local need will result in an extraordinary effort from both !           This challenge is a further continuation of their efforts to strive to achieve an outcome where families across West Lothian and Edinburgh have access to the food they need. To ensure no family or individual has to face the nightmare scenario of not being able to feed themselves  their children   or vulnerable relatives . These families should not have to go without   no one should.

There are many families struggling to put food on the table and the support forFood Banks is rising to meet the demand of those that are struggling. What started off for me was helping out one family which then turned in to a one man operation helping many Hostels Food Banks  vulnerable individuals across London.   From my home   I started contacting friends and families to support with food donations which Were then delivered in Harrow which turned into supporting Food Banks Hostels across London.   What I have realised being on the road and talking to various groups that this situation will not go away anytime soon and may get worse as more job losses occur and the reliance on Food Banks increasing .   I have decided that with the connections and networks I have formulated over the last 3 months I will create a network working with local partners where we can deliver the Aid for all those Food Banks  Hostels and families who struggle.    With that comes cost and I am raising funds to initially set up this network across London and to continue to support the community.",False

Elias Mattu Foundation had been helped by Lakshmi Sweet Centre Restaurant in Blakenhall  for hot meal on a daily base but needed others to come forward.    Some of the people we are helping are on benefits  and are elderly and vulnerable. A lot of them can't get out of the house because they are self-isolating and have no one else to do the shopping for them.    We are desperate to keep on supporting them but we need food donations.    For more information visit the Elias Mattu Foundation's Facebook page  or call Asha Mattu on 07[phone redacted]30.

We have been doing this for one month already  and aim to do it for as long as we can. We are reliant on donations from the community  whether it's monetary  ingredients  spaces  or time. We have a changing and varied group of recipients  from those who are recovering from the illness  those experiencing financial difficulties from the illness  those self isolating as a result of the illness  or those who just need some neighbourly support in these crazy and surreal times. We support anyone in any situation  of any faith  of any background. We are working with families with young children to elderly individuals to street homeless people and everyone in between. We are also now receiving referrals from local organisations who are asking us to send them food. These include councils  Women's Aid  Age UK East London  the L&Q Housing Association  the Hackney Migrant Centre and some healthcare services. More information on our story and supporters is below - thank you for any help you are able to give. Haggerston Mutual Aid.     OUR STORY SO FAR...    We started doing hot meals to those in the community over the Easter weekend when A Plate For London and Queen Mary's University kindly donated us some of their food. We saw there was a need for long term meals  and partnered with Suleymaniye Mosque on Kingsland Road to provide daily hot meals to the community (of any faith) across Ramadan. We also had further donations of food from Queen Mary's University and help from St. Michael and All Angels Church  so we started this Go Fund Me to tide us over a couple of weekends in between. The support grew at an amazing rate  and soon we had enough support to do more meals than we initially hoped. We formed a rota of tens of professional chefs  dozens of kitchen helpers  and even more delivery volunteers and co-ordinators  who started ensuring 200 meals went out daily to individuals  families  and charities across Hackney. We have just moved to Pub on the Park who have kindly offered their kitchen for us to use while they can't. We're applying for grants to keep the funding coming  and asking supermarkets and suppliers to donate as much as they can  but we do need money to buy ingredients  packaging  and pay for things like insurance. For anyone able to help  we would welcome any amount - we are not a registered charity  but we are being governed by Charity officials  and are spending every penny we receive on crucial things we need to keep feeding those who need it.     Thank you so much for any support you can give - it's hugely appreciated.    James  Kat  Caroline  Harry and all involved in Haggerston Mutual Aid :-)      ORIGINAL POSTS FOR REFERENCE...    I've recently been cooking and distributing food through some London food banks  ensuring families and individuals who are particularly vulnerable as a result of COVID-19 get daily hot meals. People have asked how they can help  so... For the next two weekends I'm cooking 150 meals a day  600 in total. I'm aiming to do yummy  hearty  healthy dishes for £3 per meal. I'm therefore looking to raise £1800 for food and £200 more for costs like packaging and kitchen hire. The meals will be going out this weekend (2-3 May) and next weekend (9-10 May) so any contributions towards this would be very gratefully received.    **UPDATE** Your donations have been incredibly generous and the target to cook meals for two weekends was hit very quickly - thank you. I've now added more weekends on to the schedule (16-17 May and working out future dates) so please keep donating if you are able to. Thank you so much!!    For clarity: this is being done through a Hackney community initiative where vulnerable people have asked for help  either because they are self isolating and are unable to shop and cook  they are elderly and are receiving reduced support  they are struggling financially as a result of their income drying up  they are not receiving free school meals for their children due to schools being closed  they are homeless  or they fall through the cracks of our welfare system and need our support for some other  genuine reason. This is not through an official charity (I have worked previously with The Red Cross  Hackney Winter Night Shelter and Lives Not Knives on similar initiatives) but instead is just a short term  community initiative to provide some immediate help to those asking for it in these strange and unknowing times. All money will go direct to either ingredients  packaging  kitchen hire  or costs directly linked to cooking and distributing the food. If anyone wants a breakdown of funds afterwards I will happily supply.     Thank you for any contribution  it's very much appreciated.     James X",False

The masks are distributed ‘free of charge’ to residents  community agencies  key services  care homes  food banks  the medical profession and those most in need across the city Volunteers sew the face masks and help us source material  though donations by residents  which are recycled into masks. Recycling material allows us to help the environment and deliver mask free of charge. Since launching on 8th April 2020 we have made and distributed over 1 000 masks but the demand is increasing especially as more people are going out as we come out of lockout. Volunteers have covered any additional costs to run the project to the stage but now need to raise funds to continue and deliver the increasing demand for masks. ALL the money will be used to: - purchase essential items which are not available through donations. - make and distribute the masks  free of charge to those that request them across the city (Glasgow). - help set up sewing hubs in other cities to provide the same service to residents in that area.

With the resounding government message that the biggest support we can give NHS is social distancing  we're hearing from a lot of our friends and colleagues that they feel unable to make a difference in a meaningful way during this unprecedented global and national crisis.     In day four of our self quarantine (and with a lot of time on our hands!)  we've come up with an idea.     i. How can commuters help?     In total  most professionals working from home are likely to make inadvertent economies  for example in London commuters will no longer be paying:    - The daily TfL capped tube fare is £10.40  - A daily coffee will set you back £2.50 (on average)    If we were to invest the savings we weren't expecting to have (or even a portion of it) to a charity  we could all make a huge difference to those on the frontline in hospitals and in the charity sectors (e.g. managing food bank shortages)  with funds being made quickly available to those who are in critical need.     ii. Why support the National Emergencies Trust?    On Wednesday 18 March  Prince William launched a Coronavirus fundraising appeal as part of the National Emergencies Trust. It is working collaboratively with a wide range of organisations to ensure the maximum amount of money is raised and distributed securely  effectively  and fairly to those organisations and local charities who can do most to help those in need.     Through a partnership network established over the past few months  the funds raised will only be channelled through the most trusted and reputable organisations  so you know you’re giving to those who need it the most.    iii. Next steps     Calculate your daily/weekly work-from-home savings and make a donation here of an appropriate amount  which will be directed to The National Emergencies Trust.     We've set a target of £5 000 but let's aim BIG!     Thank you for your time and contribution!",False

Half of the walking duo that decided back in November 2019 to walk 10 000 steps every day  starting from the 1st January 2020. For those of you have followed us from the start  you might know this  but we thought we’d give the back story of how this came about…     I’ve been friends with Brian Snr on Facebook for a while now  and every year since 2012 he has attempted to walk 10 000 steps a day  every day  for as long as possible. Like we do now  he always reported daily to prove that he was one step closer to his end goal. It started off as a way for him to lose weight and get fit. He quickly gathered support from friends and family  liking the posts  commenting messages of support  and one particular follower (me!) started posting silly hashtags #TeamScullySnr #WalksForDays #HeAlwaysWalksAlone becoming some of my favourites.     Brian’s previous record was 142 days back in 2016.    Fast forward to November 2019. Brian Jnr and I met up in London to watch a show at the o2. As Brian Snr works in the city  we arranged to meet up at the pub at Kings Cross station. I had to ask the question that people that had seen his posts for the last few years  were dying to know ‘are you going to walk again next year?’ Brian was unsure.     I quickly came out with ‘if you do it  I’ll do it with you’ – I might have been a couple of pints/gins in at this point! Brian Jnr laughed. Claimed that we’d never be able to do it. So confident  that he wagered £100. If we both walked 10 000 steps a day  for 143 days  he would pay us £50 each. The bet was made and the challenge set.     I’ll be honest  the only day I’d walked 10 000 steps last year  was that day in London. And I got no-where near it again for the rest of November and December. First of January came and I was worried what I had got myself into!    On Friday 22nd May 2020  we’d done it! No-one had ever heard of coronavirus back in November when this was discussed. Through all dark  cold and wet nights  to the country going into lockdown and only being allowed out once a day to exercise  we’d managed to still walk 10 000 steps every.single.day.    It had never been about the money for us. We streamed a zoom call between the three of us to Facebook live and announced that we wanted to donate the money to a local Peterborough charity. Brian Snr lives just outside of Peterborough  and although I now live in Bournemouth  I grew up in Market Deeping  so it seemed like a no-brainer. Amazingly  our dear friend Maxine offered to match Brian Jnr’s donation too!    We’ve had so much amazing support  and with the excitement and emotion that came on that day  we somehow managed to sign up for another 143 days!! Our new target date is Monday 12th October 2020. We have another £100 wagered with Brian Jnr.    Thank you so much if you’ve managed to read this far. And please if you can  help us raise as much money possible for all the amazing work Give Back Peterborough do in their local area.

For the last 4 years we have helped and provided the parents in The Amazon NICU and transitional care by giving essentials such as food drink and hygiene products.

With it being a tough few months for everyone stuck in lockdown  as the restrictions ease we are looking to get back to netball as soon as possible.    Many of the opportunities where we would fundraise for our netball club such as presentation night  quiz nights etc were cancelled therefore we are looking at a different approach to raise some funds this year which will benefit our club. We aim to run/cycle/walk 100 miles in October and to allow all members of our club to participate the younger players have been put into teams to complete this with one another. This will encourage team work to get the miles complete as well as a bit of fitness which we all love since we have not had any pre-season! Our older players will either work in teams of 2 or complete the 100 miles as an individual to really set the challenge! Not only will our club benefit from the fundraising but we have chosen 2 charities that we feel would really benefit from this too: Inverclyde Food Bank and Talk on Inverclyde    Both of which are very important during these hard times and we are working together to help a little where we can. 60% of the funds raised will go to the Clyde Netball Club and 20% each to the above charities.    Any donations would be greatly appreciated and we will keep you updated on our journey through the Clyde Netball Facebook page!",False

My daughter Amanda Bruce is a victim of a situation similar to that of the wind rush generation. She was made stateless in February 2016 and was unable to work  lost her job and unable to claim any benefits until the resolution in May 2018 and was given a passport within 24 hours of calling the wind rush hotline and reinstating her right to work. I am a British citizen   as was my partner. We went on a family holiday to Australia for a year (as my partners both again British parents emigrated to in the 1960 s)where my daughter was born. We returned to the UK when she was just 6 months old and has spent her entire life in this country  worked from the age of 16  paid her taxes all up until February 2016. Amanda is a hard working single mother of 2 children  she has struggled to keep the roof over her and her children’s family home in which they have lived for over 10 years . The past 2 years with no income have left her in tremendous debt. Unable to pay council tax which is now in arrears of £2 500 and her rent which is now in arrears of £2000. During the period of being unable to work or claim  my daughter prioritised feeding her son and daughter with the money friends  family and the children’s father although separated; all while sometimes starving her self and paying what little she could to keep the house as the council could not help her in any way due to the fact she was not classed as a British citizen by the government(and was unable to even claim food bank vouchers as she was not in receipt of any benefits due to being left stateless) . My daughter is now faced with the threat of eviction from her private rent company and is unable to be rehoused by the council due to the arrears over the 2 years she could not pay them (a catch 22 situation) . Bailiffs are a common sight knocking on her doors and she fears for her son and daughters well being. We do not come from a rich family  we are working class people and have struggled to keep the rent paid to date but have fallen behind and struggling to get the money together to keep the house. The Christmas holidays are coming up and while many will be celebrating  I know that my daughter will be having many sleepless nights fearing the risk of losing everything through no fault of her own. We are distraught at the way our own government has treated us over these past 2 years; when a hard working individual is victimised by the very system they have worked in for over 20 years. We ask you today for help. All we want for Christmas this year is to know that my daughter and my grandchildren will sleep in their own beds on Christmas Eve. If you wish to read more on this story  the article can be found on the evening telegraph website. I would also like to note that the wind rush compensation scheme(to which was our only means of calling the hotline to get this horrid situation finally sorted) is still in the works and we have been told it could take over 5 years to receive a penny if any ; the threat of eviction is immediate and we worry how long it will be before they are homeless. We hope you can find it in your hearts to help us in our time of need and we thank you all sincerely for taking the time to read my daughters horrific story. Any sort of help would go a long way and would be greatly appreciated  thank you all. We hope no more people are affected by this in the future it really is a horrendous situation for anyone thank you.",False

Age UK helps people make the most of later life by providing companionship  advice and support.  Bracknell food bank  brings communities together and campaigns to end hunger and poverty in the UK.     To raise money we will be walking two marathons in two days.   We are 13 years old and want to do our bit to help our community.

The HRFC development team are asking you to swap your comfortable beds for a sleeping bag / duvet and pick an unusual spot in the house or garden  spending a night out of your bed to help support a local community charity.      The Salvation Army in Hawick has been running a foodbank for a number of years in Hawick and in recent times  it has been vital in supporting the local community as the full effects of the pandemic were unfolding  more and more people were needing support. Since the beginning of Lockdown one in March 2020 the Salvation Army have provided 462 food parcels in excess of £23 100 value to the people of Hawick and its surrounding communities. This number continues to grow each day as poverty effects those from all corners of the community.      The event aims to raise some much-needed funds for the foodbank and to support its ongoing work within Hawick. Additionally  the event will allow that’s players who are involved within the ‘School of Rugby’ programme from Hawick HS and Hawick Youth RFC to deliver and be part of an event the contributes positively towards their local community.      So  if you have a shed  garage  tent  bath or even if you make a den in the living  please help support the players  coaches  volunteers and development officers in taking part in this community wide event  supporting with the fund raising efforts so that a local charity can continue their much needed  amazing work for Hawick.

However  we have seen that our current government has voted against this which is awful. We know that being hungry will affect children’s ability to concentrate in school  their sleep  their behaviour and their mental health.    Please give a fiver and if you are unable to do that  please donate some money to your local food bank or start a fundraiser yourselves!

My Dad  James Yule  recently turned 81 and  being on housebound lockdown for 12 weeks  he decided to do Couch to 5k on the back garden path.    (When my friends heard about Major Tom’s 100 laps for NHS  they thought it was my Dad!) Why?  Someone  BP  from a group he’s on  posted on the group page that - even though James didn’t ask for it - BP wants to sponsor him to complete his challenge  and he offered a donation to a charity of James’s choice!    This gave James his altruistic idea - That if people would like to encourage him to do it  by way of sponsorship  and other people can benefit from what he’s doing  then why would he get in the way of such generosity?!    As food and basic health needs are so fundamental/crucial for the people in the world who are most struggling  he would like the raised monies to go to the local food bank and/or care needs in the community.  St. Andrews Foodbank says:    “Those we serve may have lost their job  had a family split up  be victims of domestic violence  or had benefits delayed or suspended. In desperate times we are able to meet their immediate need for food.”  May we extend our human kindness to them.    How?  So  to make it easier for you to give  if you feel inclined  I’ve set up this page.    I will post updates between now and the end of May  by which he hopes to be able to complete a 5km run  actually running  for the half hour that the programme builds runners up to (and do the remainder by whichever means)!    What makes this a challenge  you might ask?   Doesn’t James do the Parkrun?    Indeed  James has done the Parkrun  before  and consistently since my Mum died  a year ago today  20th April.    He also has angina  a heart condition which makes running that bit more challenging for his body. So he will be doing it gradually/sustainably.    His mind/heart  whilst keeping it fit and agile - as well as desiring to support other people in the community to be well and healthy - is determined. How can you help?    With the challenge food banks face in receiving food from their usual sources (church congregations  supermarkets etc)  you giving money to this cause will ensure food banks are stocked  and people who need the support they offer can still access it.    Thank you for your generous support and donations.    Amitaśūrī  and James    ",False

This grant along with our Food bank helped us to put together grocery packs which we delivered on Good Friday.     Unfortunately this is only the beginning & we need to continue in our endeavour to support the community.     We have set up a gofundme page which we feel will be a great asset in helping us in the work that we have already started & in supporting the more vulnerable during these difficult days.    It is important to note that we are not asking assistance from anyone we have delivered a grocery pack to. We are asking for donations from anyone who feels that they can afford to help us in our campaign. The old saying 'A little goes a long way' is very true especially in these uncertain times    We are a small club with a big heart and want to help all members in our community who may find themselves in need in these uncertain times.

Hopefully pull together and look out for the vulnerable members of our society. And that is exactly what we are doing for our community here in Great Sankey and Penketh.    An army of willing volunteers have stepped up and started putting leaflets through every door. This is to let the elderly and people who have had to isolate themselves know  people are offering them help. Help by way of shopping  picking up prescriptions  the newspaper  and much more. This has gone down extremely well and people are genuinely grateful there are people out there  neighbours they know and neighbours further afield  who are there for them.    However we have come up against an issue that you can help us with. People isolated in their homes are unable to get out and get cash to give to the volunteer doing the shopping. Therefore they won’t ask as they don’t wish to offend. Likewise we know we have people who would be willing volunteer but haven’t as they know they can’t afford to get someone else’s shopping  not even if they are able to pay them back once they have the shopping.     Then there are the people who of course can’t go out to work as they have been told to isolate and they & their families need to eat  but simply don’t have the funds.    So we have set up this Go Fund me page in the hope some people may feel this is a way they can contribute to the wellbeing and support of the people we speak of. We are receiving help from our Penketh & Sankey Parish Council but this fund is setup to run alongside that help to ensure we have money to immediately help those in most need in our community.    If you can donate  any sum no matter how small  then the fund will give us emergency finances which in turn will enable volunteers to go out and get the essentials for our “at risk” group of people in need and those in full isolation who simply cannot get out even if its solely to collect food as allowed.    If at the end of this journey we do have money left we will donate that to the local food bank  ensuring people who still need support  still get it.     If we all do a little we can achieve a lot",False

I’m asking for help because  like so many people at the moment  Covid 19 and lockdown has financially defeated me. I started studying for my makeup artistry qualification during the first lockdown  and I am ready to begin my career in this field... but unfortunately  I am unable to raise the funds for my stock  insurance and even a car (which has died a death during lockdown) because I’ve been unable to work. I’m a mum of two and have been studying and homeschooling for almost a year now!   To put it bluntly  my kids and I don’t know how we’ve managed. I’ve been collecting food bank parcels  had family help me out with groceries and I’ve even had to let a few monthly bills go into arrears for a month or two because it was a choice between the bills and food. I cut down on the unnecessary bills as soon as lockdown hit us the first time  but it’s merely offered the ability to get a little more food in. It’s taken a lot of courage to admit that... not many people around me have known how bad it has been at times in my house     Makeup  for me  is about freedom of expression. It is about treating a face as a beautiful blank canvas with same scope for creativity.     Any face can be transformed by the application of makeup. It can be transformed  enhanced... and for some  improved. People use makeup for all manner of reasons; some wear it to make them feel more attractive  some wear it to feel empowered  ready to take on the day... a kind of war paint so to speak... some wear it simply for a level of personal enjoyment and creative freedom it offers... not to mention fun!!     For me  to do makeup on someone else’s beautiful face  the pleasure of seeing them feel transformed  beautiful and ready for any occasion is the most satisfaction one can experience. To take the stress of having to do yet another task for a bride on her big day  to pamper someone getting ready for going out to celebrate their birthday/anniversary anything... and see their happiness is so rewarding!     When I create looks on myself  I get to satisfy the artist in me. I can create literal art on my face and feel beautiful and confident all at once!! The level of freedom is immeasurable because there are simply no limits. And there is no greater fun in that kind of freedom.    I appreciate any support I may receive through this  it has taken a lot of courage tocreate this account  so any help will be greatly appreciated beyond words!! I only started exploring makeup properly during the first lockdown to help me stay focused  motivated and boredom free... and found myself better than I ever expected! I enrolled with Girl Meets Brush Academy and started entering challenges they posted and entered a competition last summer. I won a number of the individual challenges and was awarded the Highly Commended award and also was named one of the winners in the big competition held in August. The prize was to have a homemade video of a makeup creation showcased in the Digital London Fashion Week!! To win such a dream competition as that in such a short space of time gave me the encouragement and confidence to continue this career. My work is unique  my looks are innovative... and my passion is unmeasurable!! To say I love what I do is a severe understatement!!! ",False

Cricket in Buckley is a big part of our community we provide a facility for over 70 children and many adults to enjoy the sport. In addition many people enjoy social membership at the club and enjoy our event or just a nice pint in the sun..    The club is run by a dedicated group of volunteers  they have been challenged with ensuring we can survive financially through this pandemic. Our club survives through the money that is made from our bar - any profit is used to run the club or reinvested to improve the cricket facilities & training we provide. We are going to have to rely heavily on fundraising to survive these coming weeks & months... We still have many bills to pay even whilst we are closed...     We know our playing members are missing running between the wickets so we are challenging everyone to run for their Club ! We invite everyone and anybody to take part - all we ask is £5 donation to take part and then we want to accumulate as many runs as we possibly can !! Invite friends and family to sponsor your running efforts.      We also want to give something back to the community - we are aware that families are struggling so we will be sharing some of the funds we raise to support our local food bank.

He was the kindest  funniest  most unique and incredible person. He commited suicide on October 23rd 2014. He was very troubled towards the end of his life and had undiagnosed mental health problems as well as addiction problems. We  his family and friends  set up Johnny's Happy Place to hopefully change some lives in Kettering where Johnny was born and lived.     We wanted to help the homeless  lonely and those without much so we set up JHP. Initially it was just a Facebook page as a way to remember Johnny; beyond that we didn't know what we were going to do. Did we want to set up a night shelter or a refuge? A food bank? Somewhere for those with mental health problems? We came to the conclusion that we would try to create a fun and inspiring place  with the biproduct of helping people.     Johnny always wanted to set up his own ""Happy News"" channel. He hated seeing all of the awful things going on in the world and thought it would benefit people to perhaps have a channel which only broadcast happy news. This is what inspired us. There are many people out there who for one reason or another  through circumstance  are having a tough time. They might have mental health issues  they might have depression  they might not have any family  they might be homeless or just feel isolated. We decided  simply  to focus on opening a warm and inviting cafe that encourages social inclusion and that we hope enables people to walk out happier than they came in. We want it to be a warm and inviting environment and to include all of the things Johnny loved and was about: food  art  music  laughter and most of all compassion.    We are going to open Johnny's Happy Place as a creative weekend hub in Kettering  Northamptonshire: a relaxing café and imaginative space  open to all. We want to create a happy and engaging space with the by-product of helping people  by using art and being creative. We would love to offer free classes so people can learn something new  be it yoga  DJing  circus skills or a writing group for example. We've got a host of fantastic people willing to volunteer and teach their skills to others which is wonderful. We'd like art to be a main feature of Johnny's Happy Place so we'd have tables dedicated to making art  be it drawing or painting etc. We'd love to showcase local artists too  who perhaps wouldn't normally get to show off their skills. We especially want to help the lonely  homeless and those with mental health and addiction problems.    It will cost money to realise our ambitions and for it to be ongoing. It will cost money to run the building even for a weekend; we want to feed people and have a cafe and with pay what you can tea/coffe/fruit therefore we will need money to buy food and drink; we will also be redecorating!

Being part of a coastal economy is always difficult over the winter months  but the impact of COVID-19 is potentially catastrophic. Every time we ask a family to self-isolate with COVID symptoms  we’re essentially asking them to spend 14 days in a cold flat with no food. Very few of our families have a support network to rely on  because they are fleeing gang  drug or domestic violence in other parts of the UK; this means that most left their extended support network behind in Birmingham  Liverpool or Glasgow  in order to live in a place with no available infrastructure to deal with the escalating child poverty that’s been growing since the 1980s. All of our families live no more than 2 days ahead as far as food is concerned; they can’t afford to bulk shop and they don’t have a fridge or freezer to fill with supplies. Many of the young women we work with receive their feminine hygiene products from us as a school via the “Red Box” programme. Without that support  they have NO ACCESS to female hygiene products. Any period of time away from a free school meal means no access to food at the best of times; a second national or local lockdown will be catastrophic. Last time the country locked down (in March/April) we had parents ringing us in tears because they had no income  no food and (very frequently) no electricity to power the laptops that the government provided for remote learning. If this surprises you  it probably shouldn’t  because there are very many schools like ours. However  in this particular case you CAN help if you choose to. Please consider donating to our food bank; no donation is too small. We started with a small bunch of shopping bags  intending to provide a “Lockdown Survival Box” to every family we have to ask to self-isolate. Things have escalated since then  so we’re trying to run a full-on  in-house food bank from our school over the winter. We are THE BURTON ACADEMY (www.burtonacademy.org.uk) and our families need your donations  reshares and general goodwill. We’ll pick it up and run with it from there  yes? X ",False

Many families have been left to fend for themselves during this time with little support from schools and other social services. “Bridge the gap have a passion to support families  parents  children and those with additional needs as this is something dear to our hearts. At Bridge the Gap  we believe in social inclusion and want to combat the digital divide that has left so many people with no access to information  resources and learning.” - Melissa Francis had started to provide support to local families in the beginning by: Signposting them to services for further support for Befriending also offering virtual tutoring for children. Enabling access to food banks  food hubs and hot meals  Providing information on available support schemes and youth services for children’s basic educational needs (such as http://www.hackneyquest.org.uk/ and http://www.shortbreakshackney.com/short-breaks-offer-update-covid-19)  Supporting SEN families with information through https://www.hiphackney.org.uk/home.html Sourcing laptops and other devices for families that are not eligible for other kinds of funding  Sharing of information to families regarding benefit claims so that people are not pushed into homelessness. At the beginning of the pandemic  we worked with T’s tasty cuisine to provide 1 hot meal  food parcels and essential items every Wednesday for a short period. We continue to work alongside Hackney quest  the wickers charity  Caribeats and Connecting all communities organisation to provide care packages or a hot meal to families. Our main focus going forward is to provide laptops and other devices to families who otherwise would not be able to access them. These months of enforced homeschooling and unpredicted lockdown period have revealed the many barriers facing low-income families (incl. job losses  food insecurity  housing issues  domestic abuse  family bereavements and many more…). The closure of libraries and community cafes that were previously used for learning  job applications and other resources has further worsened this divide  with many people struggling to access information on where to get help. Many families have been left with no access to a laptop to continue their children’s learning and larger families have struggled to share one computer between parents working from home and multiple children needing access to online learning. since schools began to reopen after the first lockdown  we had still seen numerous amount of families still struggling for devices for their children till current  and even at present through this uncertain wave of numerous lockdowns  the list of referrals are rising as families desperately require a device for their children  hence our determination to continue with this project to help families. We have teamed up with tutors around different boroughs to provide online learning for children with the aim for children to be supported with learning they have missed out on. We aim to continue to support families to help make a difference to their lives.     Your generous donation can help make a difference.      £1000 can help support 10 families and their children or 7 families.     The break down per refurbished device is £85 per unit £15 for windows 10 to be installed per device equal to £100 per device and software.    For 10 families this will be £1000 required to raise to offer support.    For a new device purchased from curry's under a business rate of £150 we will only be able to support 7 families with a device.     1 X Amazon Tablet for a family in need (£50.00) Fuel costs to cover the expenses of our generous Community Helpers so they are not out of pocket. We think this is a really effective way to support families in Hackney and in other borough's that has reached out to our service  as we are offering a long-term solution to an urgent need. So far we have been able to offer 136 plus digital devices to families  and have 47 families are on the waiting list with more requests coming in.

We are so excited about the prospect of bringing this old Grade II listed building back to life! It was originally built in the early 1900’s as a Temperance Hall  since then it has had a plethora of uses  most recent of which left the building in a semi-derelict condition which included severe fire damage.    However  following its acquisition by The Tab Church  fresh ideas began to surface as to how it might be rescued  restored  and adapted to suit the needs for modern usage as Church  Community and Conferencing facility.    The ‘Tab1Milli’ is what will enable this most significant part of the Big Build project vision to become a reality  and the building actually able to be used.    But we can’t pull this off without your generous support because this is the largest financial project The Tab has ever undertaken.    We are therefore asking you to join with us through radical generosity  as together we step out in faith towards hitting the £1Million target by continually bringing our financial gifts together now and over the coming weeks and months.    Once the entire building is renovated  it will enable The Tab to continue and expand its traditional church functions and community initiatives  which are not limited to but currently include:  · Sunday services  · Kids church for children  · Crèche during the Sunday services  · Weekly prayer meetings  · Christian education and classes  · Administrative offices  · Bookshop/resources  · Food Bank – hosting Lewisham Central’s foodbank and distribution point. This is currently offered two-three times a week  staffed by 8-12 volunteers.  · Youth mentoring – support for vulnerable young people in the local community.  · Community action team (Restoration Empowerment and Community Help) – which focuses its support and resources on three vulnerable groups in Lewisham:  The elderly (offering days out and grocery food supplies);  The homeless (offering food clothing to those living on the streets)  and  Women and children escaping from domestic abuse (offering support).    *The Big Build Project includes the overall vision of Tabernacle Global Ministries and therefore maybe used for general purposes....",False

Pauline greinir frá því á söfnunarsíðunni gofundme.com að mikil veikindi hafi hrjáð fjölskylduna. Aníta er sex barna móðir. Tvær elstu dætur hennar eru komnar yfir tvítugt  eru báðar með sérþarfir og búa á Akranesi ásamt Anítu  Benedikt manni hennar og yngstu dætrum þeirra þremur  sem eru tíu ára gamlar. Þríburarnir fæddust löngu fyrir tímann og tvær þeirra hafa glímt við heilsufarsvandamál frá fæðingu. Sonur Anítu er námsmaður og býr í Reykjavík.    Aníta greindist með góðkynja heilaæxli árið 2015. Læknar afréðu að grípa ekki til aðgerðar  þar sem æxlið væri góðkynja og nálægt mjög viðkvæmum hreyfi- og sjónsvæðum í heilanum. Síðar þetta sama ár uppgötvaðist að æxlið var farið að stækka og valda skemmdum og Anítu óbærilegum verkjum  svo slæmum að nokkrum sinnum þurfti hún að leggjast inn á spítala til verkjameðferðar. Til stóð að senda Anítu í uppskurð  en það var talið of áhættusamt og þá var afráðið að senda hana til London í laser-aðgerð í október á síðasta ári.     Aníta átti að fara aftur til London í svokallaðan jáeindaskanna  eða PET-skanna  í febrúar síðastliðnum til að kanna áhrif aðgerðarinnar  en vegna niðurskurðar í íslenska heilbrigðiskerfinu voru ekki til peningar til að borga fyrir PET-skönnun fyrir Anítu í London. Þess í stað þarf hún að bíða fram í ágúst  eða þar til eftir að PET-skanninn sem Íslensk erfðagreining ákvað árið 2015 að gefa Landspítalanum  hefur verið afhentur og tekinn í notkun. Þangað til veit enginn hvort laser-aðgerðin í haust hafi heppnast sem skyldi. „Verkir hennar hafa aukist síðan þá og ef laser-aðgerðin heppnaðist ekki þá þarf hún að gangast undir heilaskurðaðgerð með allri þeirri áhættu sem henni fylgir. Hún hefur miklar áhyggjur af því að blindast eða lamast í aðgerðinni. Þess vegna langar hana að komast með þríburana í frí í Lególand í Danmörku  draumaáfangastað þeirra  áður en hún þarf að leggjast undir hnífinn  svo þær geti átt góðar stundir og skapað skemmtilegar minningar saman “ skrifar Pauline á söfnunarsíðuna.    „Aníta hefur átt við ýmis heilsufarsleg vandamál að stríða í mörg ár en engu að síður hefur hún aðstoðað og litið til með svo mörgum öðrum “ skrifar Pauline  en Aníta veitti til dæmis Mæðrastyrksnefnd Vesturlands forstöðu oftar en einu sinni og oftar en tvisvar. „Fjölskyldan er því miður skuldsett og laun eiginmannsins og örorkulífeyrir hennar nægja aðeins fyrir helstu nauðsynjum. Þess vegna langar mig að hjálpa henni að safna því sem til þarf svo fjölskyldan komist í frí “ skrifar Pauline.

The two oldest 25 years and 22 years have special needs  and live with Anita  her husband Benedikt and her youngest 3 girls who are 10 year old triplets. The triplets where born very premature and 2 of them have had medical problems since birth. One is autistic and another has a problem with her leg not growing properly. She has one son who lives in Reykjavik attending college.Anita was diagnosed with a non malignant brain tumour in 2015. It was decided by her team of doctors not to operate as it was non-malignant and deep inside her brain around very sensitive areas responsible for sight and motor controlLater in the year it was discovered that the tumour was growing and causing damage that caused her to have horrific pain shooting down her face and headaches that caused her to be hospitalised on many occasions.The doctors wanted to operate but at the last moment decided it was too risky and so sent her to London's Cromwell Hospital for lazer surgery in October 2016. She was meant to fly to London in February 2017 for another PET scan to see if the lazer treatment worked but as Iceland's health service has had it's budget cut in recent years there was no money to pay for the PET scan in London and so they are waiting until the end of August when Iceland will recieve a donated PET scanner  the first in Iceland.So she has no way of knowing for now if the lazer surgery has worked and the tumour receding. Her pain symptoms are getting worse and if the lazer treatment has not worked then she will have to have brain surgery with all the risks that it brings.She is very worried that she might be blinded or paralysed. So she is wanting to take her 10 year old triplets on a holiday before the operation to their dream location LegoLand in Bilund  Denmark  so that they can have fun  memories together.Anita has had health problems for many years but yet she looks after so many and even helped establish  years ago  a food bank in her town of Akranes in Iceland which she ran for many years but had to step down from that position in 2015  when the brain tumour started to cause her so much pain that she could not continue.Aníta's husband suffered a heart attack on January 8th 2014 when he was just 38 years old due to one coronary artery being 100% blocked and another 90% blocked.Unfortunately the family is riddled with debt since the economic crash of 2008 and the husband's salary and Anita's disability pension is not enough to pay for anything extra than basic needs. Therefore I want to help her raise the money the family needs.Thank you for your support.    We are looking at dates in early August and so will continue to fundraise until then.Flights will cost 256 000 IkrYouth hostel room 195 000 IkrCar rental 162 000 IkrEntry to Legoland 43 601 IkrZoo entry 15.000 IkrMeals 80 000 IkrOther expences 46 000 IkrTotal: 798 000 Ikr or £5 800.Accommodation and car rental are quite big parts of this so if someone is willing to host them in their homes or let them borrow their car  that would greatly reduce their expenses.

We are understandably gutted. Not only is Canned Laughter incredibly fun but all proceeds from ticket sales go directly to the local food bank in the area the gig is put on in and right now food banks need our support more than ever: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-51837892    All ticket holders will be offered refunds. But ideally we would still like to raise the money we would have made in ticket sales from these two gigs to help the two food banks they would have supported.    We have set our target amount roughly at 80% of all available tickets sold to both events which would have been £2 560. We will split any money raised from this drive between Eat or Heat  The Waltham Forest Food Bank (Canned Laughter - April 25th) and Euston Food Bank (Canned Laughter: Karaoke Roulette - April 4th)    We thank you so much for your support.

NC500 is a route in the Scottish Highlands covering the West and East Coast. I will be managing the equivalent by cycling a certain distance per day throughout Caithness. I will be using the app “MapMyRun” (can change to cycling) to measure the distance each day up until 516 miles is complete! The proceeds will go towards our local food bank of which is busier than ever during this pandemic (big thank you to Pat & Grant Ramsay  and their volunteers). These guys help people with emergency food supplies and aid them to getting back on their feet - and I’m sure at a time like this there will be a fewof us struggling! Any other monies raised I will put towards the retail services in Wick and small businesses - as they are the ones keeping their doors open allowing us to get our basic needs. Our NHS and carers are all doing a fantastic job  as are the retail and community members  etc etc! So a huge thank you to every key worker in Caithness. ",False

They are being faced with the horrible reality of either feeding their family or heating their house and buying fresh groceries has become a luxury  this is something we at ‘Free Shop’ want to address.   Our vision is to have a ‘free shop’ where ANYONE who is in need  no matter their background or circumstances  can shop for FREE. They will be able to choose from as range of fresh groceries and daily essentials completely free of charge. These will be procured through local donations from Crawley businesses and individuals. ""From Crawley to Crawley"". We want to put the pride back into the simple act of feeding the family and allow those in need  the gift of choice.    We are a group of mums who saw a need and are doing something about it.    We aim to provide:    • Fresh groceries   Butter  dairy free butter  Bread  glutten free bread  Fresh milk  Eggs  Apples  Satsumas  Pears  Potatoes  carrots  parsnips  butternut squash  broccoli  cauliflower.  • Non perishables   Baby formula ( variety of brands) UHT milk  free from items  gluten free pasta  dried pasta  canned sweetcorn  peas  beans  tomatoes  • Non-food items   Nappies  baby wipes  teething gel  calpol  napisan  nappy rash cream  washing tablets  washing up liquid  toilet roll  kitchen roll  shower gel  bubble bath  shampoo  conditioner ( where necessary children and adult versions)  • Baby bank outpost  Baby clothes 0-8years  small selection of other essential baby items. Provided though a collaboration with Little Gifts (an already established baby bank)    WE NEED YOU!  We are already in contact with local supermarkets to provide a selection of stock through the FareShare Scheme but in order to provide a large enough quantity of fresh food to the growing number of people in need  some items will need to be purchased in bulk using the funds raised here.    Our buy in for the Fare Share Scheme costs us money. We need £450 by December to continue to be part of the scheme (to cover December-March) to recieve fresh items at this heavily discounted rate each week (first month is free). This is not out of date produce  it is for fresh items direct from the supermarkets at a reduced bulk buy price especially for charities such as ours. We will need approximately £150 per month for this plus any items we need from the cash and carry. We expect our current food costs to be approximately £250 per month. This is before we purchase alcohol gel and cleaning products etc. So please support us if you can!    If you are in a position to support us financially  even the smallest donation would help us to provide fresh food for someone in need.    So from Free Shop Crawley     THANK YOU from the bottom of our hearts for your kind donations.    With love...    Free Shop Crawley Team",False

So many are struggling right now  and for many reasons are unable to provide or be provided with proper warm  nutritious meals due to many devastating circumstances.    I will be making the meals and providing a collection service (location to be confirmed)  until I am able to set up a full collection point in Saffron Walden. I will also be offering a local delivery service for people who are unable to collect meals whether that being due to having to isolate  no transport or having to work. Whatever reason is 100% ok and there will be no questions asked. As soon as a collection point is confirmed  I will publish it. If meals are being delivered  they will be done within a 2 hour time slot each day.    I will be serving meals Monday and Wednesday to start with  dependant on demand  and will be gradually increasing to Monday to Friday.    Meals will be ready to collect/deliver every morning with a daily menu rotation.     All meals will be vegetarian reworked ‘classics’  such as bolognese  pesto pasta and shepard's pie and served with a portion of vegetables.    Whilst starting out  the meals will be served on a first come first serve basis. Please message to reserve. Any leftover meals I will make all community groups aware of and if there’s no takers  I will deliver to the local food bank.    Please pass this message on to anybody who could benefit from receiving these meals  or any sources who can reach people who may need them.    The most important thing to know is it’ll be no questions asked and 100% confidential. Everyone needs a little help right now.    I am hoping to start rolling these meals out ASAP  start date will be announced as soon as it’s confirmed.

To date we have over 400 volunteers who have supported over 150 households on a day to day basis – and done so much more as well  delivering information  building social media platforms  planning interventions to improve security and well being of all residents.     In terms of the support we offer  from shopping services to prescription pick-ups to a weekly check in and chat  everything has been possible thanks to a grant from the parish council  and mostly  the free time and willingness of our volunteers.    As we head to the summer  there is a growing need across Charlton Kings and our wider community. We are committed to keeping our phone lines open  our virtual connections active  and will be running community events. We will also continue our support to shielded households and those needing help to reconnect with the outside world. Within the Friends community there is a listening ear for anyone who needs it  any time.    We stand by to help every family whose circumstances are difficult - to do this we will need a bit of help. There are costs to what we are doing and many of you have asked along the way if you can donate or help to our cause – thank you. This crowd fund will support local people in Charlton Kings whose circumstances make food provision challenging. Every penny will put food directly into the hands of local person who risks going without (young or old). And every penny will be spent with Charlton Kings local businesses; returning your support into our local economy.    Need will be assessed locally by our thriving community groups  or signposted by schools  churches and more – those that can pay do  those that cannot  do not – and no-one beyond the very small core Friends team knows the difference.    Please give whatever you can. £3 is a lunch for someone. £30 is a food box for a week for a single household. £300 is a community BBQ. Please help us  help everyone  in difficult times.    Our funding ambition is based on 1 in every 100 homes needing some form of support.        Thank you              *This is in addition to government school meal vouchers and food bank support. While both are welcome and necessary  there is a long list of need that can fall through the cracks. Having a fund available enables us to move within 24 hours of changing circumstances – and we always provide food  not money  which can be particularly important when children or other vulnerable people are involved.",False

That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks  supported by The Trussell Trust  working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.    ABOUT OUR FOODBANK  An introduction to the Morecambe Bay Foodbank project.  Morecambe Bay Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. It began life at the GYM Church on Green Street in Morecambe and has now moved to The West End Community Centre on Westminster Road in Morecambe. We receive and distribute over six tonnes of food each month and our operation has been growing since its inception in 2012.     We have a small staff team led by our Foodbank Manager  Annette Smith  and over eighty regular volunteers who give up their time to help us each week.    ABOUT  HOW FOODBANKS WORK  Providing emergency food to people in crisis.  Every day people in the UK go hungry for reasons ranging from redundancy to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems.    FOOD IS DONATED  Schools  churches  businesses and individuals donate non-perishable  in-date food to a foodbank. Large collections often take place as part of Harvest Festival celebrations and food is also collected at supermarkets.    FOOD IS SORTED AND STORED  Volunteers sort food to check that it’s in date and pack it into boxes ready to be given to people in need. Over 40 000 people give up their time to volunteer at foodbanks.    PROFESSIONALS IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN NEED  Foodbanks partner with a wide range of care professionals such as doctors  health visitors  social workers and police to identify people in crisis and issue them with a foodbank voucher.    CLIENTS RECEIVE FOOD  Foodbank clients bring their voucher to a foodbank centre where it can be redeemed for three days’ emergency food. Volunteers meet clients over a warm drink or free hot meal and are able to signpost people to agencies able to solve the longer-term problem.",False

Research conducted by several scientific institutions is showing that a significant number of people affected by COVID-19 go on to have symptoms for months after their initial illness. Most of us are young  previously healthy individuals who  by the official definition  initially suffered a “mild” form of the disease. Yet  months later  most of us are unable to return to work and to function at the level we were previously functioning at before falling ill.    This is beginning to attract the attention of the media  with articles being published in The Guardian  The Independent  the BBC  the Atlantic  and almost every major news provider. Despite that  the U.K. Government has so far failed to acknowledge our existence and to provide us with the medical attention and treatment we need  as is being done in other countries. We have therefore decided to launch a campaign to raise public awareness of our ongoing plight. The money we gather will be used to fund three different projects.    1.) Open letter: We plan to write an open letter signed by as many of us as possible that will be sent to decision makers  key figures  and officials in the U.K. government and the Healthcare sector to raise awareness of what we’re going through.    2.) Short Film: We are planning to produce a short film that will highlight what we’re going through. The film will include pictures of fellow “Long Haulers” holding up personal messages.    3.) Message in a Bottle: We plan to deliver a number of messages written by fellow Long Haulers to the door of Number 10  Downing Street. The messages will detail the suffering each writer has endured and will each be individually packed in a test tube to emphasise how trapped and isolated we feel. The funding will cover the costs of all three projects plus any future endeavours that the campaign team believes will contribute to raising awareness of long term covid sufferers  as well as any additional costs incurred.      The campaign team will not receive payment from the funds.      A detailed breakdown of costs as well as a description of the work currently being done can be provided by contacting the campaign team.      Any enquiries should also be directed at the campaign team.      Any funding we don’t use will be donated to food banks across the nation.

I heard about how Marcus Rashford has been trying to get free school meals for kids during half term and thought that maybe I could help too. My dad told me that since there has been no fans allowed into the stadiums for a while the food banks have lost out on lots of donations. So if we can't donate at professional level why don't we do it at grassroots level? My football club  Knowsley South FC  have given me their full support from reception age all the way up to the grown ups. We're organised collections at our football matches  a donation point locally and have arranged collections from people who are can't get out to the shops or drop off points. I've already got some lovely food donations and have got lots more to come! Because lots of people are are having to Isolate my mum and dad have set up a Go Fund Me Page for anybody who wants to help but can't donate food. Money can then go straight to the food banks. No kids should have to got to bed with a sore tummy because it's empty. If you can  please donate anything you have spare. As little as £1 can fill somebody's tummy. Thanks ⚽",False

The Canal stretches 204km (127 miles) through Merseyside  Lancashire and Yorkshire and we will be hoping to complete the entire length of the canal in what we presume to be (although haven’t checked) a record 5 days. Having eaten our way through lockdown we will be putting on our walking boots and getting in some much needed steps. We will be walking on average 10 hours per day to hopefully burn off as many Dominos and Cheeseburgers as we can. We are  however  aware that many people living in the UK do not have access to the same basic necessities that we can sometimes take for granted. A large population of people within the UK are currently living in poverty and are heavily reliant on charitable organisations such as food banks to maintain basic standards of living. The current Covid-19 climate has only gone to highlight and exacerbate these issues. As such we will be doing this walk in aid of those most vulnerable in our society and raising funds for the Trussell Trust. The Trussell Trust offer a lifeline to those most in need and we would welcome any donations  no matter how big or small  which will go a huge way to supporting those who need it most. We have added some more information on the work done by the Trussell Trust below.    • In the UK  more than 14 million people are living in poverty- including 4.5 million children.   • Between April 2018 and March 2019  food banks in the Trussell Trust network provided a record of 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis  a 19% increase on the previous year.   • 30% of children in the UK are living in property  that’s nine in a classroom of 30.  • Children from black and minority ethnic groups are more likely to be in poverty: 46%  compared with 26% of children in White British families.   • Work doesn’t provide a guaranteed route out of poverty in the UK. 72% of children growing up in poverty live in a household where at least one person works.     Primary referral causes in 2018 to 2019 to Trussell Trust food banks:  1. Income not covering the cost of essentials (33.11%)  2. Benefit Delays (20.34%)  3. Benefit Changes (17.36%)    The Trussell Trust doesn’t just provide food  their aim is to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty  and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK. All of the statistics above were taken over the course of 2[phone redacted]  as you can imagine the statistics for 2[phone redacted] will be a far lot worse.

I work for an NHS Older People Community Mental Health Team; so my clients are generally over the age of 70 and have diagnosis such as anxiety  depression  schizophrenia and dementia.    Many of my clients are self-isolating  and lots of them have family or carers that are doing their food shopping  so they are well supported.    However  quite a few of our clients live by themselves or with their elderly husband or wife  with no other support. These are the people my colleagues and I are most worried about. They are unsupported and at high risk.    As you know there has been an amazing volunteer movement in response to Corona Virus lockdown. However  due to red tape issues the volunteers aren't being linked with our clients in need of this support as quickly as we'd like.    My colleagues and I have set up a mini food bank to help our most vulnerable clients whilst we wait for volunteer support to be put in place.    I know times are hard but please please give a donation  of whatever you feel you can  so we can help our most vulnerable clients live through their self-isolation.    If there is any food or money leftover after this crisis will be donating it to a food bank charity.    Thank you so much!!!!!",False

Volunteers are coordinated via the Eternity Church to help those in need with groceries  post  prescriptions  errands and more.      This page has been created to help with 3 critical aspects of this service.       1. Many people in self-isolation do not have access to cash. So far all transactions are paid for in cash  but this is tricky  and as time goes on  access to cash will become harder.     Anyone needing to use the service can now pay for their transaction here.      2. Well-meaning residents of Downham Market wish to make donations to the food bank  while these are still needed we must be discouraged from purchasing extra supplies  to avoid putting pressure on supermarket stock levels.    Via this page we can support anyone wishing to donate from the safety of their own homes  to their families  neighbours  or just anyone who needs it. This allows us to put the funds into the most needed items.      3. Volunteers are incurring costs while helping  and we wish to reimburse them.     All donations received here will be paid directly into the bank account of the Eternity Church  for the purchase of supplies through a reputable supply chain  and reimbursing volunteers the costs of providing support to vulnerable and self isolating people.

The latest statistics for the UK show one in three (4.1 million) children live in poverty in the UK  with an estimated 2.5 million living in food insecure households.     Despite record employment  the proportion of children in poverty with working parents has now reached an all-time high of 72%. This figure is set to increase as the results of unemployment following the first 2020 lockdown is felt.    Across BET's family of schools  there are more than 800 students eligible for free school meals  with significant further increased predicted over this year.    BET’s game-changing ethos is built on empowering students to act for a better world.     The fundraiser    We are inviting our students to give a voluntary donation (suggested amount: £1) to support local food banks or The Trussell Trust - a charity supporting those in poverty and campaigning for change to end the need for food banks. Schools will run either a non-uniform day or sell silicone wristbands on Tuesday 1 December - The First for Food.    About the charity    The Trussell Trust supports a nationwide network of more than 1 200 food banks  together providing emergency food and support to people locked in poverty  and campaigning for change to end the need for food banks in the UK.

Many people have lost their jobs because of the virus  there has been a surge in the number of people becoming homeless and without food.    Being the community school we are  its only right that we are at the forefront of ‘building our community for our community’ we are doing this by setting up a food bank to provide food and essential items for our most vulnerable young people and families within our school and wider community.      More than 2.3 million Londoners live below the poverty line and 33% of adults have skipped meals to save money so that their children can eat.      The Charter School North Dulwich Go fund me page will help us to raise money to purchase food for our most vulnerable young people and families. During the festive period food was donated to the Southwark central community hub.     Our donations page will be ongoing after the new year and all throughout the academic school year and beyond     Food parcels are available on request.

We are getting reports from the ground that food donations are gradually slowing down  and so at Essex Coronavirus Action we are raising funds to provide immediate payments to a number of food banks around Essex for the purchase of food and supplies. We are also in discussions with a number of retailers to make sure that food banks can purchase the items that they are running short of  while still managing to respect the new guidelines about reserved shopping hours for those who need them.

Katrina enjoys writing stories for children in her spare time. Some of her stories have been shared with the children in our school and she has recieved some amazing feedback from the children who have loved her stories. She has kindly shared another story with us  that she has written about the Coronavirus. This is to  hopefully  enable us to raise funds for our food bank that has been extremely useful to those in need at this difficult time. Not only that  it has helped 71 families so far. If you'd like to  you can make a donation here  but only if this is feasible. The smallest amount of money can make the biggest difference. WE THINK THIS STORY IS BRILLIANT! We hope you enjoy it too!

There is more reliance on food banks such as The Trussell Trust which help provide meals for those who need it the most. £10 is all it takes for one family to be provided with an evening meal.

The Home Office have refused to help him pay their extortionate application fee so that Olusegun can join Glenford in the UK – we need £2523 to reunite this father and son.     Glenford Knight came to the UK from Jamaica at the age of 9. He grew up in Brent  worked for London Transport  and then trained in Computer Studies  after which he launched his own successful business. His whole life was here.     In 1996  Glenford travelled to Jamaica for what was supposed to be a 3 week holiday  but found himself trapped in Jamaica when he was prevented from returning to the UK  even though his passport had a ‘No Time Limit’ stamp. Suddenly  he was homeless  jobless  and separated from his family. After experiencing destitution and a severe deterioration in his mental health  he managed to start to rebuild his life in Jamaica and had two children  Gemma and Olusegun. Gemma is now 22 and Olusegun is 16.     In November 2018  Glenford was contacted by the Windrush Task Force  having been identified as a victim of the Windrush Scandal. He was initially told that his children  who were 20 and 15 at the time  would be able to return to the UK with him. However  after further communication with the Home Office  he was told that this would not be possible. He made the heart-wrenching decision to travel to the UK and make arrangements for his teenage son Olusegun to come and join him once he had arrived.     Glenford arrived in the UK in May 2019  and instructed solicitors to apply for entry clearance for Olusegun to come to the UK. But there was no way that he could afford the extortionate Home Office application fee of £1523  or the cost of Olusegun’s flight to the UK from Jamaica (around £1000). Glenford is unable to work due to a diagnosis of severe PTSD  brought on by the harrowing experience of being caught up in the Windrush Scandal and his separation from his son. He receives Universal Credit  and the vast majority of his monthly payment goes towards his housing and utilities bills  leaving him with just £50 a month to live off. He depends on food banks to feed himself.     Glenford has submitted a claim to the Windrush Compensation Scheme  but it is well documented that the Home Office is taking months or even years to settle claims: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/windrush-compensation-payout-delay-home-office-a9692251.html. Waiting for his claim to be settled before bringing Olusegun home would mean waiting indefinitely.     His solicitors made an application for an exceptional emergency payment under the Windrush Scheme to cover the cost of the application fee and flights. But this was refused by the Home Office on the basis that the request was ‘neither sufficiently urgent nor exceptional’ to warrant a grant. In the words of Glenford  ‘if my situation isn’t exceptional  I don’t know what is’.    His solicitors have lodged an application for Judicial Review of the refusal to grant an emergency payment. But he is still waiting for the High Court to grant permission for the case to go to a full hearing. Even if permission is granted  it could be over a year before the case is heard  and the outcome is uncertain.     The effect of this prolonged separation is having a devastating effect on both father and son. Glenford calls Olusegun every day; they are desperate to be reunited.     We need your donations to bring Olusegun to the UK so that he can be with his father  where he belongs.",False
