CHESS currently operates a direct access 9 bedroom shelter in Chelmsford, providing a safe enviroment and services, including a bedroom, hygiene/laundry facilities, home cooked meals and drinks.  During the Covid pandemic we changed this property to a self sufficient 4 bedroom property which operates 24/7, to enable self isoloation if required. CHESS also provides 7 other properties including an annex to the shelter which serve as a further step towards independent living. This in turn means we can house up to 42 individuals in total currently. We aim to further increase this so we can accommodate up to 64 individuals at any one time. Not having access to everyday essentials and services makes it difficult for those experiencing homelessness to sustain relationships, employment and contribute to society. They often come from chaotic backgrounds with complex needs. Many CHESS Service Users have had the additional trauma of rough sleeping and health related issues. Not having any structure to their day makes it extremely hard for them to gain control of their lives, which can have a detrimental effect on their health, leading to addiction, depression and poorer physical well-being. Once enrolled into the CHESS Change Programme, residents are assigned to a Support Worker who works with the individual to indentify causes of homelessness and address issues they may be facing.  They will assist them with registering with local services, and ultimately securing more permanent accommodation. We offer a professional counselling service, and refer to other providers to help them with any problems they have that empowers them to move on in their lives. We offer certificated training courses providing qualifications that could lead to employment. Our Outreach Team support any rough sleepers referred via Streetlink, covering Chelmsford, Maldon, Braintree, Rochford and Epping. We provide sleeping bags, warm clothes and snacks, with the possibility of temporary accommodation at our Shelter for emergency cases.","2021-04-25 20/2021-03-31 20/2021-03-31 5/2021-03-31 25/2021-03-30 10/2021-03-30 25/2021-03-30 50/2021-03-30 20/2021-03-29 10/2021-03-29 10/2021-03-28 5/2021-03-28 10/2021-03-27 100/2021-03-27 5/2021-03-27 5/2021-03-27 15/2021-03-26 30/2021-03-26 5/2021-03-26 15/2021-03-26 10/2021-03-25 50/2021-03-24 50/2021-03-24 5/2021-03-23 20/2021-03-21 50/2021-03-20 5/2021-03-20 10/2021-03-19 20/2021-03-19 20/2021-03-19 5/2021-03-19 15/2021-03-19 5/2021-03-18 20/2021-03-18 50/2021-03-10 20/2021-03-09 30/2021-03-08 10/2021-03-08 30/2021-03-07 10/2021-03-07 20/2021-03-07 10/2021-03-07 30/2021-03-07 10/2021-03-07 50/2021-03-07 10/2021-03-07 10/2021-03-07 5/2021-03-07 5",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=rosiew&pageUrl=7,2021-04-25,,,1055

Shelter will help anyone with a housing problem, whether they are a home-owner struggling to pay their mortgage, a tenant in conflict with their landlord or a homeless person looking for a roof over their head. Our housing experts give advice and support by phone or email, or face-to-face at our network of housing aid centres and in county courts and outreach centres.   We also have specialist projects that provide long term support to people who are trying to escape bad housing and homelessness.   Shelter tackles the root causes of bad housing by lobbying government and local authorities for new laws and policies, and more investment, to improve the lives of homeless and badly housed people.  Our influential campaigns bring aspects of bad housing to the attention of the media and the public, who  help us fight for solutions.   Shelter believes that everybody needs a home in a place they can thrive.

We’re committed to making a real difference to the lives of young people aged 16 - 24 in the local community who are homeless or threatened with homelessness. We offer support, advice and information and help them achieve the skills they need to be able to live independently. We work closely with vulnerable people and their families, using mediation to help them stay in their homes whenever we can, and if that’s not possible, providing practical solutions and crisis intervention to make sure they feel safe and secure in their new environment.  hyh also gives valuable support to groups with specific needs, such as care leavers, young offenders, those with mental health issues and people recovering from drug and alcohol abuse. We want to make sure they have a firm base for a brighter future – and your fundraising activities are an essential part of this. Where will the money go?  All the funds you raise will contribute towards helping vulnerable young people who are either homeless or faced with homelessness find a safe place to live, receive support when they need it and have someone to turn to when they feel they have nowhere else to go. Most of all, you’ll be giving them hope and a real opportunity for a positive future.       ","2020-12-18 250/2020-12-09 15/2020-12-01 20/2020-11-04 85/2020-10-06 160/2020-09-22 10/2020-09-17 10/2020-06-25 10/2020-04-30 5/2020-04-30 10/2020-04-29 5/2020-04-29 15/2020-04-27 15/2020-02-24 45/2020-02-10 70",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=UnoCharityOfTheYear&pageUrl=1,2020-12-18,,,771
32,,"c/o Crisis Skylight,66 Commercial Street  London,London  E1 6LT","Vision Care For Homeless People",False,2021-03-02,"Vision Care for Homeless People is a charity set-up to provide free eye care services to homeless and other vulnerable people in an accessible and friendly environment in which they feel safe, welcome and comfortable. WHAT WE DO: We preserve, protect and promote the ocular health of homeless and vulnerable people in the UK. We carry out a fully comprehensive eye examination and provide spectacles all totally free of charge. Homeless people are more vulnerable than the general population. They have a higher risk of being assaulted or having property stolen, so spectacles might be lost or broken beyond repair. By providing this service we help thousands of people see a brighter future. We currently have nine clinics, details of which can be found here. Do sign up to receive our bi-monthly newsletter here. OUR GOAL: Our goal is to expand our services so that by 2022 we can reach 40% of the UK's homeless people and ensure that they have access to regular eye care and the provision of spectacles so that they can enjoy the gift of sight. THE CHALLENGE: To meet our ambitious goal we need to raise £1.5 million by 2022 to ensure we have the ability to not only continue providing our current high level of service but to expand our capabilities and offer help to the many thousands of people that desperately need it. WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP: We know there are lots of people in the UK who wish they could give us that money all in one go, but we recognise that not everyone can, so we're asking everyone to help us out by giving us something small that you can afford so that together we do great things. A pound may not seem like much but if everyone in the UK gave us just a single pound each we would have enough money to run our service and match our ambitions for many years to come. We also welcome those seeking to help us in other ways. We've previously had people perform sponsored runs, bike rides and even bungee jumps for us so we're always open to new and innovative ways for people to raise support for the charity!
