0,,"56 Alleyn Road,  London,  SE21 8AH","Norwood and Brixton Foodbank Limited",False,2020-12-15,"  The Norwood and Brixton Foodbank is part of the Trussell Trust network of foodbanks that provide essential food and toiletries to people in crisis. The Foodbank was formed in September 2011 with the support and encouragement of a number of local churches. Having established distribution points in West Norwood, Brixton and Streatham the foodbank regularly feeds 10,000 people in poverty each year. Over 70 tonnes of food is needed to meet the need in our community and your donation will help us towards meeting that goal. **Corona Virus Update: Since the outbreak of Covid-19 we have adapted our parcel distribution model to ensure the safety of our clients and staff. We have developed a delivery service shipping parcels directly from our Streatham warehouse to our client's homes. Despite the huge logistical challenge this presents, and an estimated 400% increase in demand, we have still been able to provide essential food parcels to all those referred to us. Thank you for your continued donations that are making this possible**  ","2021-01-05 10/2020-12-22 10/2020-12-22 20/2020-12-21 30/2020-12-21 10/2020-12-21 100/2020-12-18 10/2020-12-18 10/2020-12-18 30/2020-12-18 20/2020-12-18 15/2020-12-18 15/2020-12-18 15/2020-12-18 15/2020-12-17 15/2020-12-16 10/2020-12-16 10/2020-12-16 15/2020-12-16 30/2020-12-16 40/2020-12-16 20/2020-12-16 30/2020-12-16 20/2020-12-16 10/2020-12-16 15/2020-12-15 50/2020-12-15 15",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=NLambethCouncilHousingDepartment&pageUrl=1,2021-01-05,,,600

The Foodbank was formed in September 2011 with the support and encouragement of a number of local churches. Having established distribution points in West Norwood, Brixton and Streatham the foodbank regularly feeds 10,000 people in poverty each year. Over 70 tonnes of food is needed to meet the need in our community and your donation will help us towards meeting that goal. **Corona Virus Update: Since the outbreak of Covid-19 we have adapted our parcel distribution model to ensure the safety of our clients and staff. We have developed a delivery service shipping parcels directly from our Streatham warehouse to our client's homes. Despite the huge logistical challenge this presents, and an estimated 400% increase in demand, we have still been able to provide essential food parcels to all those referred to us. Thank you for your continued donations that are making this possible**  ","2020-11-23 5/2020-11-15 15/2020-11-10 30/2020-11-10 30/2020-11-09 20/2020-11-09 30/2020-11-08 30/2020-11-08 20/2020-11-08 10/2020-11-08 20/2020-11-08 16/2020-11-08 15/2020-11-08 15/2020-11-08 15/2020-11-08 5/2020-11-08 30/2020-11-08 20/2020-11-08 30/2020-11-08 20/2020-11-08 50/2020-11-08 25/2020-11-07 20/2020-11-07 5/2020-11-07 17/2020-11-07 20/2020-11-07 15/2020-11-07 15/2020-11-07 50/2020-11-06 50/2020-11-05 10/2020-11-04 15/2020-11-04 10/2020-11-04 50/2020-11-04 100/2020-11-03 15/2020-10-31 30/2020-10-31 20/2020-10-29 20/2020-10-29 20/2020-10-29 20/2020-10-29 15/2020-10-29 50/2020-10-29 15/2020-10-29 100",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=4LFoodbankchallenge&pageUrl=1&isTeam=true,2020-11-23,,,1362

Through food and cash donations we are able to supply 3 day emergency food parcels to those in financial crisis. With every passing year we have seen the demands on our service rise as the pressure of low income, benefit issues, debt and issues following the rollout of Universal Credit drag more people into crisis. The support Worcester Foodbank provides helps to restore people with a fresh hope for their future.  By the end of this year we anticipate that we will have provided food parcels to feed over 10,000 people and over 53,000 since opening in June 2012.  That will represent about 665,000 meals, and 665,000 occasions upon which someone did not go hungry.   Our Vision and Values Worcester Foodbank operates under the Charitable status and Trustee governance of All Saints Church, Worcester, and under a franchise from the national foodbank charity, the Trussell Trust. Our vision and core values reflect both organisations; and we are committed to: In all of this we seek to remove the need for our services by reducing food poverty in this country.

We are now supporting 10,943 charities, helping to feed 924,325 people every week who would are living in food insecurity.  Last year we redistributed enough food for 46.5 million meals. But it’s about more than meals. The organisations we supply food to, from breakfast clubs for disadvantaged children, to homeless hostels, community cafes and domestic violence refuges, are places that provide life changing support, as well as lunch and dinner.   By making sure good food is not wasted, we turn an environmental problem into a social solution.","2021-01-21 15/2021-01-20 10/2021-01-20 13/2021-01-20 15/2021-01-19 10/2021-01-18 10/2021-01-18 10/2021-01-18 10/2021-01-18 15/2021-01-18 15/2021-01-18 10/2021-01-18 15/2021-01-18 10/2021-01-18 10/2021-01-15 25/2021-01-15 2/2021-01-15 10/2021-01-15 10/2021-01-15 10/2021-01-15 10",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=SagePowerPAs&pageUrl=4&isTeam=true,2021-01-21,Essex,"SS11 8SH",255

The peninsula, surrounded by water and connected to the mainland by just a thin strip of land had already suffered enough from a 30 year civil war that had left the region destroyed. Many locals had left the region for safety reasons a long time ago. One of those people was Anandan Arnold, who had migrated to England in 1983. On seeing the utter horror and loss of life broadcast in television images after the Asian tsunami in 2004, he decided to return to Jaffna and do whatever he could to help.    He was devastated by the destruction he encountered in his home village of Manipay. Vivid  recollections of a childhood growing up in once peaceful Manipay – playing in the gardens of the Green Memorial Hospital with his brothers – all these things began to haunt him; and he knew he had to do something to help the people that he felt he had left behind. Seeing the dilapidated, sad and forlorn state of the Green Memorial Hospital, which had been a premier Hospital in Northern Sri Lanka during his childhood and a significant landmark of Manipay particularly moved him. He brought back news to the rest of us in the UK that something must be done to revive the hospital, so that it could serve this long-neglected community properly.    The Hospital was started by Dr Samuel Green, a medical missionary from America, in 1847. He trained medical graduates who worked for the Medical Services Board run by the then colonial British Government. This was, in fact, the second oldest medical school in Asia (after Kolkata in India) but ceased training doctors after Dr Green returned to the US in 1875.    Later the Hospital was run by the American Ceylon Mission (ACM) and a Medical   Board was established by AMC in 1945 after which the mission transferred   responsibility for its institutions to the local community.    The Charity Soon after Anandan’s visit, a charitable Trust was soon formed - known as the “Friends of Manipay Hospital” (FOMH) to raise funds and assist the hospital. We were fortunate to receive a kind, early donation from the family of the Late Emmanuel Lewis, who had travelled to Sri Lanka during World War 2 in the services of the Merchant navy. The family donated around £1000 to our cause - half the money was contributed in lieu of flowers at his funeral.    We used this money and our own contributions of a further £1000 to repaint one of the dilapidated buildings and re-commence clinical services at the hospital. We also paid for newly recruited nurses at the hospital to go to India for nursing training.    This was followed by a Consultant Anaesthetist (Dr. Preman Jeyaratnam) from Stoke- on Trent, dedicating a whole year to the Hospital, volunteering as Medical Director to oversee the resurrection of the Hospital.   An Orthopaedic Surgeon Mr Michael Beverley from Richmond-upon- Thames who   was working at Ealing Hospital in West London at the time - also volunteered at the Green Memorial hospital and provided consultations in 2012.    Another cousin, Dr George Mather from Letchworth, ran week-long free dental   clinics especially for Deaf children and children with learning difficulties for 3   successive years. The charity has since donated funds/equipment to Green Memorial Hospital either  directly or indirectly with the support of other charities:  The charity has since donated funds/equipment to Green Memorial Hospital either directly or indirectly with the support of other charities:  The funding that has been received, together with contributions made by patients who can afford to pay, has helped the hospital to be revived and provide basic medical care to locals who would otherwise have to travel long distances to seek government-provided care. Often families do not have the resources to pay for transportation by car, which they would need when feeling unwell.  An urgent care centre/emergency service operates around the clock to care for medical emergencies. Around 30 patients are seen daily. A free out-patient clinic is run twice monthly.  Around 10 patients who have suffered strokes receive in patient rehabilitation.  We started the Institute of Medical Sciences (IMS) with seed funding as a Sri Lankan based charitable Trust with local trustees to run the Nurse training programme. IMS took in students from orphanages, with inadequate arrangements for further care, to train as Health Care Assistants.  All students were given meals accommodation and clothing for 1 year. IMS has now commenced Diploma courses in Nursing with the approval of the Sri Lankan Health Ministry.  Fundraising for 2017  Michael Arnold, also from Manipay, moved to London from Italy some years ago and thereafter ran a charity Cricket match in Barnet, north London, in the summer of 2016 to raise funds for the hospital and is once again spearheading efforts to raise funds by encouraging some of his London-based friends to do a cycle ride of 400 Km in Sri Lanka in March this year. Gerald Simon from Twickenham is the passionate person heading up the team Rideforcharity.  On the 1 st of March 2017, they will begin their charity ride and with it our 2017 fundraising campaign kicks off.  Being only their first project, RideForCharity is looking to raise a mere eight thousand dollars (US) -- and any material donation such as medical equipment or hospital furniture.  It is poignant that most people in rural Manipay visit the hospital by bicycle and even when a child is sick the bicycle often becomes their method of transport.   We hope our story inspires you to undertake similar campaigns for the welfare of people less privileged than us.

This remote region of 39,000 people has no electricity, no running water and is severely affected by the HIV & AIDS epidemic. There are no other NGOs (non-governmental organisations) working in the region and the local government strongly encouraged Temwa to work in this area due to its desperate need for basic development.  Temwa’s initial projects were in Usisya, which is made up of 56 villages. The first project undertaken was to build a community centre in Usisya, which is where Temwa's headquarters are. Temwa has recently expanded to cover the whole of Nkhata Bay North, which incorporates 89 villages.  Overseen by a project manager in Malawi, Temwa consists of a series of programmes that are aimed at providing sustainable community-driven development in four key areas: Health Education Skills Development Agriculture and Irrigation Schools Support Temwa works to provide hope for the future among the people of Malawi by: -providing an infrastructure to support Malawian families facing financial and humanitarian hardship, irrespective of religious orientation. -creating partnerships and programs to equip the local population with the skills and resources to ensure ongoing health, education and financial stability for families and the wider community.","2020-11-03 75/2020-11-02 30/2020-11-02 30",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=CarolineBeckett1&pageUrl=2,2020-11-03,"Bolton, Bury, Manchester City, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford City, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan",,135

The peninsula, surrounded by water and connected to the mainland by just a thin strip of land had already suffered enough from a 30 year civil war that had left the region destroyed. Many locals had left the region for safety reasons a long time ago. One of those people was Anandan Arnold, who had migrated to England in 1983. On seeing the utter horror and loss of life broadcast in television images after the Asian tsunami in 2004, he decided to return to Jaffna and do whatever he could to help.    He was devastated by the destruction he encountered in his home village of Manipay. Vivid  recollections of a childhood growing up in once peaceful Manipay – playing in the gardens of the Green Memorial Hospital with his brothers – all these things began to haunt him; and he knew he had to do something to help the people that he felt he had left behind. Seeing the dilapidated, sad and forlorn state of the Green Memorial Hospital, which had been a premier Hospital in Northern Sri Lanka during his childhood and a significant landmark of Manipay particularly moved him. He brought back news to the rest of us in the UK that something must be done to revive the hospital, so that it could serve this long-neglected community properly.    The Hospital was started by Dr Samuel Green, a medical missionary from America, in 1847. He trained medical graduates who worked for the Medical Services Board run by the then colonial British Government. This was, in fact, the second oldest medical school in Asia (after Kolkata in India) but ceased training doctors after Dr Green returned to the US in 1875.    Later the Hospital was run by the American Ceylon Mission (ACM) and a Medical   Board was established by AMC in 1945 after which the mission transferred   responsibility for its institutions to the local community.    The Charity Soon after Anandan’s visit, a charitable Trust was soon formed - known as the “Friends of Manipay Hospital” (FOMH) to raise funds and assist the hospital. We were fortunate to receive a kind, early donation from the family of the Late Emmanuel Lewis, who had travelled to Sri Lanka during World War 2 in the services of the Merchant navy. The family donated around £1000 to our cause - half the money was contributed in lieu of flowers at his funeral.    We used this money and our own contributions of a further £1000 to repaint one of the dilapidated buildings and re-commence clinical services at the hospital. We also paid for newly recruited nurses at the hospital to go to India for nursing training.    This was followed by a Consultant Anaesthetist (Dr. Preman Jeyaratnam) from Stoke- on Trent, dedicating a whole year to the Hospital, volunteering as Medical Director to oversee the resurrection of the Hospital.   An Orthopaedic Surgeon Mr Michael Beverley from Richmond-upon- Thames who   was working at Ealing Hospital in West London at the time - also volunteered at the Green Memorial hospital and provided consultations in 2012.    Another cousin, Dr George Mather from Letchworth, ran week-long free dental   clinics especially for Deaf children and children with learning difficulties for 3   successive years. The charity has since donated funds/equipment to Green Memorial Hospital either  directly or indirectly with the support of other charities:  The charity has since donated funds/equipment to Green Memorial Hospital either directly or indirectly with the support of other charities:  The funding that has been received, together with contributions made by patients who can afford to pay, has helped the hospital to be revived and provide basic medical care to locals who would otherwise have to travel long distances to seek government-provided care. Often families do not have the resources to pay for transportation by car, which they would need when feeling unwell.  An urgent care centre/emergency service operates around the clock to care for medical emergencies. Around 30 patients are seen daily. A free out-patient clinic is run twice monthly.  Around 10 patients who have suffered strokes receive in patient rehabilitation.  We started the Institute of Medical Sciences (IMS) with seed funding as a Sri Lankan based charitable Trust with local trustees to run the Nurse training programme. IMS took in students from orphanages, with inadequate arrangements for further care, to train as Health Care Assistants.  All students were given meals accommodation and clothing for 1 year. IMS has now commenced Diploma courses in Nursing with the approval of the Sri Lankan Health Ministry.  Fundraising for 2017  Michael Arnold, also from Manipay, moved to London from Italy some years ago and thereafter ran a charity Cricket match in Barnet, north London, in the summer of 2016 to raise funds for the hospital and is once again spearheading efforts to raise funds by encouraging some of his London-based friends to do a cycle ride of 400 Km in Sri Lanka in March this year. Gerald Simon from Twickenham is the passionate person heading up the team Rideforcharity.  On the 1 st of March 2017, they will begin their charity ride and with it our 2017 fundraising campaign kicks off.  Being only their first project, RideForCharity is looking to raise a mere eight thousand dollars (US) -- and any material donation such as medical equipment or hospital furniture.  It is poignant that most people in rural Manipay visit the hospital by bicycle and even when a child is sick the bicycle often becomes their method of transport.   We hope our story inspires you to undertake similar campaigns for the welfare of people less privileged than us. Thank you.","2020-12-10 50/2020-12-08 30/2020-12-07 20/2020-12-07 50/2020-12-07 50/2020-12-07 30/2020-12-06 75/2020-12-06 20",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=CycloneBureviFoodandWaterAid&pageUrl=8&isTeam=true,2020-12-10,,,325

118,,"Friends Of Manipay Hospital,1 Beauchamp Court  Victors Way,Barnet  EN5 5TZ","Friends Of Manipay Hospital",True,2020-12-06," The Beginning - Friends of Manipay Hospital Copy link to Visit video tour of the Hospital https://manipayhospitaldotorg.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/manipay-green.mp4  When the tsunami of 2004 hit Sri Lanka, the Jaffna peninsula in the northern far reaches of the island was one of the areas that bore the brunt. The peninsula, surrounded by water and connected to the mainland by just a thin strip of land had already suffered enough from a 30 year civil war that had left the region destroyed. Many locals had left the region for safety reasons a long time ago. One of those people was Anandan Arnold, who had migrated to England in 1983. On seeing the utter horror and loss of life broadcast in television images after the Asian tsunami in 2004, he decided to return to Jaffna and do whatever he could to help.    He was devastated by the destruction he encountered in his home village of Manipay. Vivid  recollections of a childhood growing up in once peaceful Manipay – playing in the gardens of the Green Memorial Hospital with his brothers – all these things began to haunt him; and he knew he had to do something to help the people that he felt he had left behind. Seeing the dilapidated, sad and forlorn state of the Green Memorial Hospital, which had been a premier Hospital in Northern Sri Lanka during his childhood and a significant landmark of Manipay particularly moved him. He brought back news to the rest of us in the UK that something must be done to revive the hospital, so that it could serve this long-neglected community properly.    The Hospital was started by Dr Samuel Green, a medical missionary from America, in 1847. He trained medical graduates who worked for the Medical Services Board run by the then colonial British Government. This was, in fact, the second oldest medical school in Asia (after Kolkata in India) but ceased training doctors after Dr Green returned to the US in 1875.    Later the Hospital was run by the American Ceylon Mission (ACM) and a Medical   Board was established by AMC in 1945 after which the mission transferred   responsibility for its institutions to the local community.    The Charity Soon after Anandan’s visit, a charitable Trust was soon formed - known as the “Friends of Manipay Hospital” (FOMH) to raise funds and assist the hospital. We were fortunate to receive a kind, early donation from the family of the Late Emmanuel Lewis, who had travelled to Sri Lanka during World War 2 in the services of the Merchant navy. The family donated around £1000 to our cause - half the money was contributed in lieu of flowers at his funeral.    We used this money and our own contributions of a further £1000 to repaint one of the dilapidated buildings and re-commence clinical services at the hospital. We also paid for newly recruited nurses at the hospital to go to India for nursing training.    This was followed by a Consultant Anaesthetist (Dr. Preman Jeyaratnam) from Stoke- on Trent, dedicating a whole year to the Hospital, volunteering as Medical Director to oversee the resurrection of the Hospital.   An Orthopaedic Surgeon Mr Michael Beverley from Richmond-upon- Thames who   was working at Ealing Hospital in West London at the time - also volunteered at the Green Memorial hospital and provided consultations in 2012.    Another cousin, Dr George Mather from Letchworth, ran week-long free dental   clinics especially for Deaf children and children with learning difficulties for 3   successive years. The charity has since donated funds/equipment to Green Memorial Hospital either  directly or indirectly with the support of other charities:  The charity has since donated funds/equipment to Green Memorial Hospital either directly or indirectly with the support of other charities:  The funding that has been received, together with contributions made by patients who can afford to pay, has helped the hospital to be revived and provide basic medical care to locals who would otherwise have to travel long distances to seek government-provided care. Often families do not have the resources to pay for transportation by car, which they would need when feeling unwell.  An urgent care centre/emergency service operates around the clock to care for medical emergencies. Around 30 patients are seen daily. A free out-patient clinic is run twice monthly.  Around 10 patients who have suffered strokes receive in patient rehabilitation.  We started the Institute of Medical Sciences (IMS) with seed funding as a Sri Lankan based charitable Trust with local trustees to run the Nurse training programme. IMS took in students from orphanages, with inadequate arrangements for further care, to train as Health Care Assistants.  All students were given meals accommodation and clothing for 1 year. IMS has now commenced Diploma courses in Nursing with the approval of the Sri Lankan Health Ministry.  Fundraising for 2017  Michael Arnold, also from Manipay, moved to London from Italy some years ago and thereafter ran a charity Cricket match in Barnet, north London, in the summer of 2016 to raise funds for the hospital and is once again spearheading efforts to raise funds by encouraging some of his London-based friends to do a cycle ride of 400 Km in Sri Lanka in March this year. Gerald Simon from Twickenham is the passionate person heading up the team Rideforcharity.  On the 1 st of March 2017, they will begin their charity ride and with it our 2017 fundraising campaign kicks off.  Being only their first project, RideForCharity is looking to raise a mere eight thousand dollars (US) -- and any material donation such as medical equipment or hospital furniture.  It is poignant that most people in rural Manipay visit the hospital by bicycle and even when a child is sick the bicycle often becomes their method of transport.   We hope our story inspires you to undertake similar campaigns for the welfare of people less privileged than us. Thank you.","2020-12-10 50/2020-12-08 30/2020-12-07 20/2020-12-07 50/2020-12-07 50/2020-12-07 30/2020-12-06 75/2020-12-06 20",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=CycloneBureviFoodandWaterAid&pageUrl=8&isTeam=true,2020-12-10,,,325

EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by three full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.   EFP operates 8 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme. Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances. Each food pack provides at least three meals/per day for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave). In 2019-20, we provided 16,984 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 73% increase on the previous year. We were able to do so by receiving 190,000kg of food from donations. Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps. Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres.  Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.

For every £1 donated, the Felix Project saves £4 of food. Our operation is simple, reliable and efficient.

In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year. That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger.

The peninsula, surrounded by water and connected to the mainland by just a thin strip of land had already suffered enough from a 30 year civil war that had left the region destroyed. Many locals had left the region for safety reasons a long time ago. One of those people was Anandan Arnold, who had migrated to England in 1983. On seeing the utter horror and loss of life broadcast in television images after the Asian tsunami in 2004, he decided to return to Jaffna and do whatever he could to help.    He was devastated by the destruction he encountered in his home village of Manipay. Vivid  recollections of a childhood growing up in once peaceful Manipay – playing in the gardens of the Green Memorial Hospital with his brothers – all these things began to haunt him; and he knew he had to do something to help the people that he felt he had left behind. Seeing the dilapidated, sad and forlorn state of the Green Memorial Hospital, which had been a premier Hospital in Northern Sri Lanka during his childhood and a significant landmark of Manipay particularly moved him. He brought back news to the rest of us in the UK that something must be done to revive the hospital, so that it could serve this long-neglected community properly.    The Hospital was started by Dr Samuel Green, a medical missionary from America, in 1847. He trained medical graduates who worked for the Medical Services Board run by the then colonial British Government. This was, in fact, the second oldest medical school in Asia (after Kolkata in India) but ceased training doctors after Dr Green returned to the US in 1875.    Later the Hospital was run by the American Ceylon Mission (ACM) and a Medical   Board was established by AMC in 1945 after which the mission transferred   responsibility for its institutions to the local community.    The Charity Soon after Anandan’s visit, a charitable Trust was soon formed - known as the “Friends of Manipay Hospital” (FOMH) to raise funds and assist the hospital. We were fortunate to receive a kind, early donation from the family of the Late Emmanuel Lewis, who had travelled to Sri Lanka during World War 2 in the services of the Merchant navy. The family donated around £1000 to our cause - half the money was contributed in lieu of flowers at his funeral.    We used this money and our own contributions of a further £1000 to repaint one of the dilapidated buildings and re-commence clinical services at the hospital. We also paid for newly recruited nurses at the hospital to go to India for nursing training.    This was followed by a Consultant Anaesthetist (Dr. Preman Jeyaratnam) from Stoke- on Trent, dedicating a whole year to the Hospital, volunteering as Medical Director to oversee the resurrection of the Hospital.   An Orthopaedic Surgeon Mr Michael Beverley from Richmond-upon- Thames who   was working at Ealing Hospital in West London at the time - also volunteered at the Green Memorial hospital and provided consultations in 2012.    Another cousin, Dr George Mather from Letchworth, ran week-long free dental   clinics especially for Deaf children and children with learning difficulties for 3   successive years. The charity has since donated funds/equipment to Green Memorial Hospital either  directly or indirectly with the support of other charities:  The charity has since donated funds/equipment to Green Memorial Hospital either directly or indirectly with the support of other charities:  The funding that has been received, together with contributions made by patients who can afford to pay, has helped the hospital to be revived and provide basic medical care to locals who would otherwise have to travel long distances to seek government-provided care.

This remote region of 39,000 people has no electricity, no running water and is severely affected by the HIV & AIDS epidemic. There are no other NGOs (non-governmental organisations) working in the region and the local government strongly encouraged Temwa to work in this area due to its desperate need for basic development.  Temwa’s initial projects were in Usisya, which is made up of 56 villages. The first project undertaken was to build a community centre in Usisya, which is where Temwa's headquarters are. Temwa has recently expanded to cover the whole of Nkhata Bay North, which incorporates 89 villages.  Overseen by a project manager in Malawi, Temwa consists of a series of programmes that are aimed at providing sustainable community-driven development in four key areas: Health Education Skills Development Agriculture and Irrigation Schools Support Temwa works to provide hope for the future among the people of Malawi by: -providing an infrastructure to support Malawian families facing financial and humanitarian hardship, irrespective of religious orientation. -creating partnerships and programs to equip the local population with the skills and resources to ensure ongoing health, education and financial stability for families and the wider community.","2020-11-17 20/2020-11-03 20/2020-11-02 15/2020-10-31 10/2020-10-31 10/2020-10-30 50/2020-10-30 10/2020-10-30 80/2020-10-30 10/2020-10-30 10/2020-10-30 3/2020-10-30 10/2020-10-29 10/2020-10-29 10/2020-10-29 3/2020-10-29 15/2020-10-29 15/2020-10-29 20/2020-10-29 10/2020-10-29 10/2020-10-29 10/2020-10-29 10",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=SamRussell70&pageUrl=3,2020-11-17,"Bolton, Bury, Manchester City, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford City, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan",,371

The peninsula, surrounded by water and connected to the mainland by just a thin strip of land had already suffered enough from a 30 year civil war that had left the region destroyed. Many locals had left the region for safety reasons a long time ago. One of those people was Anandan Arnold, who had migrated to England in 1983. On seeing the utter horror and loss of life broadcast in television images after the Asian tsunami in 2004, he decided to return to Jaffna and do whatever he could to help.    He was devastated by the destruction he encountered in his home village of Manipay. Vivid  recollections of a childhood growing up in once peaceful Manipay – playing in the gardens of the Green Memorial Hospital with his brothers – all these things began to haunt him; and he knew he had to do something to help the people that he felt he had left behind. Seeing the dilapidated, sad and forlorn state of the Green Memorial Hospital, which had been a premier Hospital in Northern Sri Lanka during his childhood and a significant landmark of Manipay particularly moved him. He brought back news to the rest of us in the UK that something must be done to revive the hospital, so that it could serve this long-neglected community properly.    The Hospital was started by Dr Samuel Green, a medical missionary from America, in 1847. He trained medical graduates who worked for the Medical Services Board run by the then colonial British Government. This was, in fact, the second oldest medical school in Asia (after Kolkata in India) but ceased training doctors after Dr Green returned to the US in 1875.    Later the Hospital was run by the American Ceylon Mission (ACM) and a Medical   Board was established by AMC in 1945 after which the mission transferred   responsibility for its institutions to the local community.    The Charity Soon after Anandan’s visit, a charitable Trust was soon formed - known as the “Friends of Manipay Hospital” (FOMH) to raise funds and assist the hospital. We were fortunate to receive a kind, early donation from the family of the Late Emmanuel Lewis, who had travelled to Sri Lanka during World War 2 in the services of the Merchant navy. The family donated around £1000 to our cause - half the money was contributed in lieu of flowers at his funeral.    We used this money and our own contributions of a further £1000 to repaint one of the dilapidated buildings and re-commence clinical services at the hospital. We also paid for newly recruited nurses at the hospital to go to India for nursing training.    This was followed by a Consultant Anaesthetist (Dr. Preman Jeyaratnam) from Stoke- on Trent, dedicating a whole year to the Hospital, volunteering as Medical Director to oversee the resurrection of the Hospital.   An Orthopaedic Surgeon Mr Michael Beverley from Richmond-upon- Thames who   was working at Ealing Hospital in West London at the time - also volunteered at the Green Memorial hospital and provided consultations in 2012.    Another cousin, Dr George Mather from Letchworth, ran week-long free dental   clinics especially for Deaf children and children with learning difficulties for 3   successive years. The charity has since donated funds/equipment to Green Memorial Hospital either  directly or indirectly with the support of other charities:  The charity has since donated funds/equipment to Green Memorial Hospital either directly or indirectly with the support of other charities:  The funding that has been received, together with contributions made by patients who can afford to pay, has helped the hospital to be revived and provide basic medical care to locals who would otherwise have to travel long distances to seek government-provided care. Often families do not have the resources to pay for transportation by car, which they would need when feeling unwell.  An urgent care centre/emergency service operates around the clock to care for medical emergencies. Around 30 patients are seen daily. A free out-patient clinic is run twice monthly.  Around 10 patients who have suffered strokes receive in patient rehabilitation.  We started the Institute of Medical Sciences (IMS) with seed funding as a Sri Lankan based charitable Trust with local trustees to run the Nurse training programme. IMS took in students from orphanages, with inadequate arrangements for further care, to train as Health Care Assistants.  All students were given meals accommodation and clothing for 1 year. IMS has now commenced Diploma courses in Nursing with the approval of the Sri Lankan Health Ministry.  Fundraising for 2017  Michael Arnold, also from Manipay, moved to London from Italy some years ago and thereafter ran a charity Cricket match in Barnet, north London, in the summer of 2016 to raise funds for the hospital and is once again spearheading efforts to raise funds by encouraging some of his London-based friends to do a cycle ride of 400 Km in Sri Lanka in March this year.

On the 1 st of March 2017, they will begin their charity ride and with it our 2017 fundraising campaign kicks off.  Being only their first project, RideForCharity is looking to raise a mere eight thousand dollars (US) -- and any material donation such as medical equipment or hospital furniture.

Through food and cash donations we are able to supply 3 day emergency food parcels to those in financial crisis. With every passing year we have seen the demands on our service rise as the pressure of low income, benefit issues, debt and issues following the rollout of Universal Credit drag more people into crisis. The support Worcester Foodbank provides helps to restore people with a fresh hope for their future.  By the end of this year we anticipate that we will have provided food parcels to feed over 10,000 people and over 53,000 since opening in June 2012.  That will represent about 665,000 meals, and 665,000 occasions upon which someone did not go hungry.   Our Vision and Values Worcester Foodbank operates under the Charitable status and Trustee governance of All Saints Church, Worcester, and under a franchise from the national foodbank charity, the Trussell Trust. Our vision and core values reflect both organisations; and we are committed to: In all of this we seek to remove the need for our services by reducing food poverty in this country.
