However we understand that providing accomodation isn't the only way to end homelessness and provide a range of holistic opportunities for our clients. With the help of their support worker, they can learn the skills needed to live independently, address their past and build a positive future.    We offer homeless prevention and wellbeing education sessions, mediation, counselling, a foodbank and have 4 furniture shops selling quality donated items and new low cost white goods.  We operate an outreach programme to engage with and support rough sleepers plus offer daily support from our main homeless site, Reconnect.     We are affiliated to YMCA England, but are responsible for raising our own funds so every penny you raise is spent locally.    With your donation you are helping to change lives Thank you               ","2020-11-07 10/2020-11-01 10/2020-10-24 10/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-17 15/2020-10-17 10/2020-10-17 10",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=maylow&pageUrl=1,2020-11-07,"Throughout Wales",,80
