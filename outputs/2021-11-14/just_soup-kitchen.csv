,,,"England and Wales 298858, Scotland SC042140","British Liver Trust",False,2021-09-14,"<p>My childhood friend, Sharon Riley, turned 50 in December last year but I was unable to celebrate this special birthday with her due to the pandemic. I also turned 50 this year and Sharon &amp; I were looking forward to marking our milestone birthdays together with our families. &nbsp;Sadly, this was not to be, as Sharon unexpectedly died in April of this year, two months before my birthday. She had started to feel unwell in December but put a lot of her symptoms (exhaustion, lack of appetite and nausea) down to the menopause. &nbsp;Unknown to us all, Sharon's symptoms were something more sinister and in March she was admitted to hospital with concerns about her liver. &nbsp;She was tested for hepatitis A, B and C &nbsp;but results were all negative. &nbsp;She was also tested for Hepatitis E ( I had never even heard of this), which also proved to be negative. &nbsp;Even though all her symptoms were pointing to liver failure, the CT scan showed no scarring or enlargement of her liver. &nbsp;She was not transferred to a liver specialist hospital (such as the Royal Free in London) as her case was considered not <span>acute enough. &nbsp;The doctors were optimistic that her liver would heal and she wouldn't need a transplant. The family were advised to be patient as her recovery could prove to be a slow journey. &nbsp;However, Sharon was in hospital for just one month, due to the pandemic, she was unable to be visited by friends and family and died on April 13th.</span><span>&nbsp;For all of us that knew Sharon, there will always be so many unanswered questions and what ifs. What we do know is, that even though Sharon was tested for the known types of Hepatitis, there are other types out there that are still unknown.&nbsp;</span><span>The British Liver Trust provides advice and information to patients and families; campaigns and works with healthcare professionals to improve early diagnosis and patient care; raises awareness of how to look after your liver and supports research.&nbsp;There</span><span>&nbsp;are over 100 types of liver conditions; some are rare and others can be prevented.  20% of the population is at risk of liver disease, there are many causes we still don’t know about.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I have so many beautiful memories of Sharon, ones that make me smile and some that make me laugh out loud. &nbsp;One such memory is dragging Sharon running with me, along Zig Zag Lane, wearing her 'daps' from Woolworth's, both of us getting the giggles and &nbsp;her complaining the whole time of a stitch. &nbsp;She never came running with me again. I was very proud of her though when she took up running as a mum in a concerted effort to get fit later in life.</p><p>As I run my first half marathon through Hackney, my thoughts will be with you Sharon and the forty years of memories we shared together!</p><p><span>Thank you for your support, and please don’t forget to Gift Aid your donation if you are a UK taxpayer.</span></p>",44,44,"2021-10-18 30/2021-10-04 30/2021-10-02 20/2021-10-02 20/2021-09-30 20/2021-09-29 250/2021-09-29 20/2021-09-28 30/2021-09-28 30/2021-09-28 10/2021-09-28 50/2021-09-27 15/2021-09-27 20/2021-09-27 10/2021-09-27 25/2021-09-27 10/2021-09-27 10/2021-09-27 20/2021-09-27 20/2021-09-27 100/2021-09-26 20/2021-09-26 30/2021-09-26 40/2021-09-25 30/2021-09-23 20/2021-09-23 20/2021-09-23 20/2021-09-22 30/2021-09-22 10/2021-09-22 50/2021-09-22 20/2021-09-17 100/2021-09-17 40/2021-09-17 50/2021-09-16 30/2021-09-16 40/2021-09-15 30/2021-09-15 10/2021-09-14 50/2021-09-14 20/2021-09-14 30",https://www.justgiving.com/Kirsten-Kitchen50,2021-10-18,1480,0,"Kirsten's page"

The rest of the journey will be organised as I go along. My aim is to be in Jerusalem by the end of November and back home in the UK for Christmas (I’ve promised my family). That’s roughly 10,000&nbsp; kilometres in just over three months. I’ve avoided a detailed plan in preference for spontaneity but the headlines are I will be travelling out through France, Italy, Greece and Turkey, and returning via the Balkans, then central and Western Europe. Unfortunately I will be forced to fly to Israel from Turkey as the land route either through Libya or Syria is too dangerous at the moment.</p><p>I will be generally sleeping in the back of the car, with<br>seats removed.&nbsp;<span> </span>I use my mum’s old 1970 sofa cushion for a bed, and it serves the purpose well. Other than a map, a washing up bowl, a kettle, basic car repair kit and half a dozen changes of clothing that’s it. I’m doing everything on the ultra-cheap.</p><p><b>Why-</b>&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly it’s for myself. I don’t feel right unless I take on a few big trips a year especially now that I’m retired. But it’s also to raise money for my favourite charity 'Become' (<a href=""http://www.becomecharity.org.uk/"">http://www.becomecharity.org.uk/</a>),which is the leading charity helping young people coming out of the care system and starting adult life. In my career as a psychiatric nurse I encountered many people for whom this transition had gone badly wrong. This is common. 'Become' works with care leavers to help them establish a firm footing, as they take their first steps toward independent living</p><p><b>What equips me for<br>this?</b> -</p><p>&nbsp;I am a sixty year old overweight, rheumatic retired psychiatric nurse with a lifelong love of independent travel using local transport, walking, hitch hiking or driving ordinary vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p>There has been scores of these trips but just taking the best this hobby has taken me on over 10,000 miles worth of trips by motorhome around the USA. More recently I have travelled by long distance bus and ferry boat around Argentina (including Northern Patagonia) and the nearer parts of Uruguay.&nbsp;</p><p>I spent a month travelling around India by train using second class carriages, that is those used by the poorest local people. Despite a general lack of fitness I’ve walked the first hundred miles of the Via Egnatia, a rough country track which follows a Roman road across Albania. Each spring for the last five years I have walked 100-200 miles&nbsp; on the ancient pilgrimage route, the Camino Sangtiago de Compestela that runs from France to Galicia in North-Western Spain.&nbsp;</p><p>During the 1980’s and early 1990’s I lived In South Africa and travelled extensively in neighbouring countries (Lesotho, Swaziland, Zambia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe). </p><p>I enjoy this kind of thing, and have been doing it<br>since I was a teenager. I do my best to be around local people, talk to strangers and find out how they live. I stay well clear of any tourist hubs and instead hop between smaller towns and immerse myself in local life for a few days. I’m the resilient type and tend to find a way of getting through or past obstacles.</p><p>On this trip I will be posting a daily blog and Facebook updates where ever possible. Sponsors will be able to follow my journey through these.</p><p>I have been very fortunate in my life but I've known many people who grew up in care, and then failed to find the help and support they needed when the time came to leave. Often they were ill equipped to cope alone and went on to have serious mental health or drug and alcohol problems. The charity 'Become' is all about helping such people with this transition. I've supported them for a number of years through personal donations , and have seen the quality of help they provide. Its really all about improving the life opportunities of people for whom things can...and&nbsp; often go badly wrong&nbsp; That's why I have chosen to undertake this trip to benefit 'Become'.</p><p>All the costs of travel are being met by myself and a separate network of sponsors. No money raised for 'Become' will come to me.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

None of us have ever taken part in an event like this before and regardless of our background we will all find this challenging.<br></span><span><br></span><span>Taking place on the longest day of the year, we will relay through the day into the night. We will push the limits of human endurance and run a 228km relay across the John Muir way in Scotland from Helensburgh on the west coast to Dunbar on the East coast, each runner will have to run a total of between 50km and 64km in 4 stages of anything from 7km to 24km.  There will always be 1 runner on the route whilst the other 3 move by car to set exchange points, this is repeated until we finish some 24 hours after we start.  With a combination of running varied distances and being crammed in to a car between legs on top of little to no sleep, this will test us all physically and mentally.<br></span><span><br></span><span>There are an estimated 136,000 people living in slavery in the UK (Global Slavery Index 2019).

,,,1124833,"The Mayor's Fund for London",False,2021-07-29,"<p><b>Support Children at Risk of Food Insecurity!</b><br><br>We are master’s students from the School of Management at the University of Bath raising awareness of food insecurity and funds to combat this issue. Households that are ‘food insecure’ mean that they cannot guarantee sufficient quality or quantity of food.<br><br>Our efforts will be directed to support Kitchen Social, a leading holiday food provision programme in this space. <br><br>Founded by an independent charity, the Mayor’s Fund for London, Kitchen Social gives children and young people a safe place to socialise, learn and get a free, healthy meal. The programme helps to alleviate the financial strain on families that comes with accessing food and childcare activities during the school holidays. Long school breaks, without the support that young people need to thrive, is one of the drivers of educational attainment gaps between young people from different socio-economic backgrounds. Food insecurity over the school holidays can lead to learning loss, lower self-esteem, and weight gain. Poor nutrition and social isolation not only affect a child’s wellbeing but also impacts physical and mental development, thereby perpetuating the cycle of poverty.<br><br>Kitchen Social has a city-wide network of over 100 local community organisations including schools, adventure playgrounds, and youth clubs that provide nutritious food and fun activities. In response to the pandemic, Kitchen Social also created ""Take and Make"" – a recipe box series designed to engage children at home with their families. These boxes contain ingredients for four portions of nutritious food, alongside recipe cards and online video tutorials.<br><br><br><b>What we'll deliver:</b><br><br>&nbsp;・Raise funds for Kitchen Social’s Take and Make boxes so they can be distributed to young people during the Christmas break, providing opportunities for children to learn new skills and cook together with their parents</p><p><span>・Contribute to Kitchen Social’s Christmas Grant Activities where families can attend a Christmas party in their local area, access food, and take part in entertaining activities</span></p><p><br><b>Why it's a great idea:</b><br><br>Covid-19 has caused the number of families living in food insecurity to rise. A recent Mayor’s Fund for London survey revealed that 75% of families reported having less money for food. Many do not qualify for government support.  <br><br>Kitchen Social is stepping up to support more local community organisations during school holidays. Take and Make boxes help to ease the pressure that some parents feel outside of term-time. It is a fantastic way to support a child's wellbeing and encourage young people into the kitchen to learn about ingredients, try new skills and cook nutritious food with families and friends. <br><br>We will be running an online cooking class to fundraise for this project. Engaging with two nutrition-based TikTokers and a chef who will be doing a live cook along. These activities aim to: <br><br>・Contribute towards Christmas holiday funding, providing young people with activities, social engagement, and a delicious meal during the Christmas break</p><p>・Fund ingredients for Take and Make boxes</p><p>・<span>Provide children at risk of food insecurity with Take and Make boxes</span></p><p>More information about our online cooking class is available at the link below!!!:</p><p>https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/online-cooking-class-with-nigel-thompson-teawithmrt-tickets-165170827391?keep_tld=1<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",12,12,"2021-08-08 5/2021-08-08 10/2021-08-02 5/2021-08-02 30/2021-08-01 30/2021-07-31 4/2021-07-31 25/2021-07-31 20/2021-07-31 5/2021-07-31 20/2021-07-31 20",https://www.justgiving.com/mayorsfundxbath,2021-08-10,300,300,"Online Cooking Class"

This is just a small part of my project and I'm partially hoping that it will work as a form of non-traditional&nbsp;public art. Whilst brainstorming ideas for this project, I focused on Peterborough because I have lived here most of my life meaning I have a personal attachment to this specific Urban Environment. A big issue in most urban environments is homelessness because of the overpopulation of the area, meaning it is difficult to earn money and afford a roof over your head, let alone food to eat. This is a huge problem in Peterborough so I'm using this project to start a campaign and raise awareness. </p><p>I have started this fundraising page mainly to raise awareness about Peterborough Soup Kitchen. Upon researching them recently, I have found out that they provide food and drinks for 35 - 76 people A DAY.

Rough sleepers need additional support to self-isolate and protect themselves from Covid-19.  Providing someone with a place to stay, a meal to eat and someone to talk to, are invaluable in supporting struggling individuals find their feet again during times of a global pandemic or otherwise.</p><p><br>Christmas time can be the most difficult for homeless people, both <br>because of the cold weather that makes sleeping rough even more <br>dangerous and because of being without family at Christmas. Unfortunately Covid-19 pandemic has only increased this. There are <br>many factors that can lead to homelessness and it is often the most <br>vulnerable people in our community that are affected. <br><br>To watch the video click the link<a href=""https://herringbonekitchens.com/herringbone-and-catching-lives-christmas-donations"" target=""_blank""> Together We Can</a></p><p></p><p>According to <a href=""https://www.catchinglives.org/"">Catching Lives</a>, a homelessness charity aimed at supporting rough sleepers, homeless and vulnerably housed in Canterbury and East Kent, there is even less support available than previous years due to funding cuts by the government. Homelessness rose by a record 22% last year, with 726 deaths in 2018 and expected increase this winter.&nbsp; For the people that Catching Lives supports, it can be a long journey to getting back on their feet and recovering from the trauma of rough sleeping. Providing someone with a place to stay, a meal to eat and people to talk to, simple things that most of us take for granted, are invaluable first steps to getting the support they need.</p><p>At <a href=""https://www.herringbonekitchens.com"" target=""_blank"">Herringbone Kitchens</a> we know how fortunate we all are to have warm homes. As a company we have supported Catching Lives, for the past 7 years through donations and by giving our time cooking meals for the homeless. A service particuarly close to our hearts is the Catching Lives Night Shelter, which provides 2400 bed spaces over December through to March for people in need.&nbsp;The charity also offers basic meals, showers, laundry and storage facilities.</p><p>This year we want to help Catching Lives show the real face of homelessness and to help raise money for the Winter Night Shelter. To encourage businesses and people about the small things we can all do to make a difference, we  worked together with Catching Lives to produce a Christmas tale - “Together We Can”. This video is a spin on the popular Christmas Ad’s often ran by large department stores this time of year and has set a goal to help raise £15k to keep the Winter Shelter open.   </p><p>There were no actors used in the video, the family in the film are Lydia and Rob Merry,  clients of Herringbone Kitchens and the homeless man is James Duff, who was previously homeless and now is a Trustee of Catching Lives. <a href=""http://redcapeproductions.co.uk/"">Red Cape Productions</a> made and produced the film and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/maxinescottt/"" target=""_blank"">Maxine Scott</a> produced and recorded the single ‘Together We Can.’ The filming was shot across Canterbury and at the Winter Night Shelter at Catching Lives. </p><p>Together there are easy ways to help support the homeless, through giving time or money.

The personal story is as important as the recipe. For those who don’t like to cook (mentioning no names!), there’ll be a section of easy recipes which are useful when we’re touring. There will be vegan/gluten/dairy-free/Keto recipes in there so everyone has something to try. Not all recipes will make the book, but I will create a digital resource where you can subscribe and access all of the submitted recipes.

,,,1186569,"NHS Charities Together",False,2020-04-16,"<p><span>Hi everyone!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Just a little page I’ve set up here as I know, like many people, I’ve felt a little bit helpless and wanting to support more during this strange time we're all living in. There’s not one of us who won’t be effected in some way by what’s going on and I know we are hearing a lot about the devastation, but there are many positives popping up too with people coming together (virtually), raising money, and the general recognition for the incredible key workers and those on the frontline (NHS, Armed Forces, Carers, Food suppliers and Supermarket workers, Hospital cleaners, Police, Teachers, etc).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>The brilliant 5k challenge got me wondering if there’s something similar but from home, especially for anyone unable to run or get outside right now. I so far haven’t found a page where you cook/bake, post, nominate, and DONATE some money for EACH INGREDIENT used in your masterpiece…so this is what I’m starting here! I’ve seen so many fab chefs and bakers come out of the woodworks during this period - so why not help and donate a little something whilst you’re at it (it may be something you're making for yourself or others, and can also be a therapeutic way to manage any anxieties this may all be bringing).</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>I’ve baked/made a load of things mainly with ingredients we already had since the lockdown began and have now donated £1 for every ingredient used. Just ONE bake or dish (it doesn’t have to be cake or anything overly fancy - unless you want it to be! Anything sweet or savoury, baked or cooked) could make a difference (even those ‘3 ingredient recipes’ will still be something) and they can be healthy too (although this isn’t a requirement...😉). We all know some essentials are a little scarce right now so consider it a challenge to get creative too!</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>This can include something you’ve made during this period already, just:</span></p><p><span>- Share a picture of it</span><span>&nbsp;on your Instagram or Facebook (if you don’t have access to these, send to someone who can share it for you)</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>- Add #pitchinfromthekitchen<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>- Nominate however many people<span>&nbsp;you’d like for them to give it a go too (although you DON’T need to wait to be nominated as you can start your own chain!)</span></span></p><p><span>- And DONATE £1 for EACH ingredient used in that recipe.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There are tonnes of completely worthy charities this could go to. A key one is of course ‘NHS Charities Together’ who I donated half to; the other half I donated to Trussell Trust (supporting food banks). As you can only select one charity through Just Giving, ALL donations through this page’s link will go directly to ‘NHS Charities Together.’ In addition to the sheer importance of the NHS to me (and all of us), I’ve chosen this one having read about the invaluable support these funds could offer to the incredible NHS volunteers, frontline staff, isolated patients and their families right now, which I’m hoping will last a long time even after this has passed. I've also heard first hand accounts from those I know who are working at all costs on the frontline; so this is my very small way of saying a very big thank you.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Here’s to a target of £200 to start with and&nbsp;</span><span>ki</span><span>cking it off by nominating people who I know love to bake or cook!</span><span>&nbsp;Enjoy, and stay safe! x&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span></span></p><p>NB: Any donations have been processed once you receive the ‘donation complete or thank you ✅’ message, but this can take a few hours to show up on the fundraising page. <br></p><p>Instagram: pitch_in_from_the_kitchen&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook: Pitch in from the kitchen&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>- - - - - -&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

,,,1180847,"Friends of Clinks Care Farm",True,2021-06-03,"<p>Me and Georgia are aiming to do a skydive on the 25th June. My charity I’ve chosen is for ‘Clinks care farm’ and this is something close to my heart. As many know my autistic brother who is also mute attends here, makes friends and they do everything in their power to provide support in all aspects. They’ve been part of my life for a while and never seen a fault. So as a little charity I thought I would do this skydive to help support the amazing work they already do. If you can’t donate just a share of this would be appreciated. If you can donate you can do it through this page or to me directly if easier. Thank you so much. 😊💪<br></p><p><br></p><p>The next big expense for Clinks Care Farm is the expansion and enlargement of the Log Cabin kitchen area. This was needed even before Coronavirus because more Farm Helpers and Volunteers have been coming to the Farm. Now, with the new arrangements having to be put in place because of the virus, the enlarged area is vital before the autumn and winter months so we can safely meet up, have lunch and socialise - which is an important part of being on the Farm. In order to achieve this we need to raise £10,000. The charity has already raised some funds, but our fundraising events for this year are cancelled so we are running out of time to get the works completed. Please help us out to ensure this vital piece of work can be finished as soon as possible.

Join us on the SNAP Facebook page as well to give us some words of encouragement - we're going to need it!!!""</span></p><p><font color=""#000000"">This really is an incredible challenge and we can not wait to watch it live on SNAP's Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/SnapCharity&nbsp;</font></p><p>Every donation is hugely appreciated and will go a long way towards helping SNAP continue to be here for Essex families who have a child or young person with any special need or disability.

I might only be little but I wanted to do my bit to support a great charity who have helped me and my family a lot.

My plan is that each day, I will complete 26 laps of the kitchen island. I will do this for 26 days.

Food is a language the crosses all borders.<br><span><br>In the words of our founder Max.....</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>""This group was never about trade in the economic sense. It was always about humanity and it was always about love. And it was also about understanding that music is an *essential* element of our being human. We have every reason to think that communities have been singing, playing, drumming and dancing together for hundreds of thousands of years, with every song and beat binding people together, literally creating and perpetuating harmony across our planet.</p><p>In our modern world, and contrary to all our instincts, we have commodified our artistic output and although we have created great art, high and low, in the process, we have also forgotten that music belongs to us all. If you have ever felt like expressing yourself artistically but stopped because you felt that your art was not worthy, the Viral Jukebox is your home. I mean it.</p><p>More than once since I created this group people have suggested that I could find a way to monetise it. They are missing the point. The currency here is love. Spend freely. Give freely. And remember, if you sang or played it from your heart, you played it right.""<br><br>So this Christmas, with the Pandemic rolling on and weird hybrid lockdown in place, we thought it would be great to raise money, together, for our favourite causes, so choose the one closest to your heart (or follow the person who made a song you like and vote for a cause they love!)<br><br>Happy Christmas Jukeboxers!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br></p>",4,4,"2020-12-25 25/2020-12-19 10/2020-12-18 10/2020-12-11 10",https://www.justgiving.com/ViralJukeboxforRefugees,2020-12-25,52,1007,"Viral Jukebox Christmas Crackers - Christmas Songs for Refugee Kitchen"

This time, I have set up a Just Giving page to help the NHS fight the Coronavirus. </p><p> Not only am I raising money for the NHS fighting COVID-19 but I am raising money for them to help my Grandad (David Kitchener) who has unfortunately contracted the virus last week. With great sadness he passed away on the 6th of may midday. He was an amazing man and my best friend.&nbsp;</p><div><p> If you know me then you know that I am very close to my Grandad and have travelled all over the country with him when he has taken me to my athletics meetings. He has supported me through thick and thin and now it is time to support him in his hour of need. If it wasn't for my Grandad I wouldn't be the man that I am today as he helped shape me and pushed me to be the best that I can through sport and his endless love for his family. My Nan (Jane Kitchener) is at home alone now and it seems unfair but this is how things are now. She is surrounded by people who love her and the support that we have had from the people around us is amazing<span>.</span></p><p><span>My grandad was an amazing man and will be so proud and grateful for all your donations.

From the Doctors and Nurses to the reception staff they have all had a hand in helping loved ones get back on their feet, no matter the challenge. </p><p> Please donate to this fantastic cause and help the people we love return to the people that they love. </p><p> We will start streaming at 1800hrs on Sunday the 10th of may through to the 11th of may at 1800hrs.</p><p> I will be streaming over on twitch so please feel free to drop by.

<p><span><span>The response I got from everyone was amazing and quite simply the tourists I met along the way could not believe it and the donations I received showed their respect for the Soldiers in the Rifles Regiment. (Nearly £500), all that brass made my rucksack even heavier !</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I have now received nearly £4000 and this does not include the gift aid, the money will be used well and greatly appreciated by the Soldiers and their families, once again many thanks.</span></span></p>

<p><span>I am going to be dropped off for free at St Bee's by my mate who lives at Robin Hood's bay I will then buy a local postcard put a 2nd class stamp on it to give me a fighting chance and Address it to my mate then look out Royal Mail as I attempt to race your snail mail back to Robin Hood's bay!!!</span></p>
<p><span>I will walk, run stroll or trot it don't matter a jot as long as I get from West to East with my Ironing Board on my back and collect donations along the way, I will be seen by many flying the Rifles Flag and standing in places like Kirby Stephen I will ensure that everyone is made aware of the Care for Casualties Charity.</span></p>

We are lucky enough to have working ovens and we are going to use them to raise these much needed funds at a time of crisis. Each sponsor will receive gift of love heart cookies as a thank you as will the amazing volunteers and the Streetlytes guests.
You can’t feed people without an oven! Any money left over once the oven is up and running will go towards giving them a boost in 2021 when their needs are bigger than ever. This is small fundraiser which will make a huge impact.

We want to begin by addressing the physical need of food by starting a Saturday Feeding project, initially for 40-60 of the most vulnerable children, rising to 100 kids in the Jambiani area.<br></p><p>To begin with we will rely upon a small group of volunteers, led by Clalence to identify the most needy children, and to deliver the Saturday Club. </p><p>As well as the provision of food, the Saturday Club will also begin to meet the social needs of children by providing group activities such as acrobatics and street dancing.&nbsp; </p><p><b>About my friend Clalence:</b></p><p></p><p>Clalence was the very first child we helped in Iringa in 2007!<br>He lived on and off the streets for many years, but thanks in part to the love and help he received from FISCH, he not only survived but became a man with a heart for helping others in need.<span>In the past few years Clalence set up Move Zanzibar, a&nbsp;</span><span>non-profit organisation whose vision is to move, educate and motivate the young </span><span>generation of Zanzibar. The plan is for Move Zanzibar to become a project of </span><span>FISCH, so we can work together to make a difference for the most vulnerable </span><span>children in Zanzibar.</span></p><p></p><p>FISCH always aim to have a direct impact on the needs of the most<br>vulnerable children.&nbsp; There long-term aim is for these children to become self-sufficient, balanced, well rounded and valuable members of the community. </p><p></p>",0,0,,https://www.justgiving.com/Isobel-Goodall,,0,0,"Sebastian Goodall's Birthday"

<h3>Hadrian’s Wall Path</h3>
<p>When the Roman Empire decided to build a wall to keep the marauding Pictish Scots out of northern England, they likely didn’t consider that their handiwork would one day form the backdrop for one of the country’s finest walks. Spanning 135km from Bowness-on-Solway in Cumbria, to appropriately named Wallsend in Tyne and Wear, this moderately challenging National Trail fuses bracing hiking with the cultural heritage for which the UK is famous. Large sections of the wall remain intact, along with a fine museum at the painstakingly excavated Roman fort of Segedunum</p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>While serving I won Exercise Yorkshire Canter twice in the eighties, covering 100 miles in 24hrs, carrying full kit and Rifle, changed my socks after the first 60 miles whether they needed it or not, when you do something such as this you just keep your body moving, there's plenty of time to rest at the finish point. I Completed an 85 km X Country Ski marathon in 7hrs 01 min and even managed to run the B.F.T. 1 &amp;1/2 mile backwards in under 11 &amp;1/2 mins, I am coming out of retirement to complete this challenge because I want to ""do"" something to Support <span>'The Rifles Charities- Care for Casualties'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to raise as much money as possible because they are commited to:</p>
<p>1. Caring for members of the 'Rifles family', both those serving and their families.</p>
<p>2. Offer enduring support to injured Soldiers and their families.</p>
<p>3.Continue to fundraise to ensure the Soldiers and their families receive the highest quality care as possible.</p>
<p>This is why I need your help in sponsoring me, any donation will help in maintaining the high care and support that <span>'Care for Casualties'</span> currently gives out.</p>
<p><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong></p>
<p>I am going to walk Hadrians wall from Solway Firth in the West to Wallsend in the East, total mileage 84 miles, over undulating ground, unaided, with nil costs, eat on the hoof and complete it in 2 days, oh ! and I will be carrying a <strong>kitchen sink</strong> on my back and hoping to get sponsorship from <strong>B&amp;Q</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have today 9/7/10 had confirmation that B&amp;Q are going to sponsor me and now have the Kitchen sink complete with taps etc. Once I have secured it to my rucksack I will post more photographs wearing the bright orange B&amp;Q apron with my name on it and of course the much sought after Rifles Regimental T Shirt.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Thanks to everyone who has sponsored me so far</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I have 50 Rifles wrist bands to give out to people I meet along the wall &amp; a Rifles pennant to fly off my rucksack.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Fund raising going well, big effort being carried out by B&amp;Q in Stockton to raise as much cash in the store.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Once again big thanks to all of you for your kind donations.</span></strong></p>
