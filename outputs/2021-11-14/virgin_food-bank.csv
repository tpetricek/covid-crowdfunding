,,"St Christopher's Hospice","At St Christopher’s Hospice our vision is of a world in which all dying people and those close to them have access to care and support, whenever and wherever they need it.   Each person is unique and we tailor our care to meet social, emotional and spiritual needs, as well as manage physical symptoms. Our goal is to help people live well until they die and support those affected by the loss of a loved one. Every year we provide care and support to over 6,000 people across South East London, both at home and in the hospice.   We passionately believe that everyone should have access to the best care at the end of their lives and have an extensive education programme, working with people across the world, to improve and develop hospice care.   We were founded in 1967 by Dame Cicely Saunders and, 50 years later, her words still remain at the heart of everything we do: “You matter because you are you and you matter until the last moment of your life.”   As a registered charity we need to raise £16 million every year to continue to care for people when it matters most. Without the support of our local communities this wouldn’t be possible.

,,"The Trussell Trust","We support a nationwide network of food banks and together we provide emergency food and support to people locked in poverty, and campaign for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year. That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK. If you'd like more information or have any questions about fundraising please don't hesitate to contact us. We'd be delighted to hear from you. ",False,2021-03-31,"2021-04-29 30/2021-04-27 10/2021-04-23 30/2021-04-01 50/2021-03-31 30",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROSomeoneSpecialPage?pageUrl=GeneralDonations,2021-04-29,,,570
,,Tommy's,"Tommy's funds research into miscarriage, stillbirth and premature birth, and provide pregnancy health information to parents. We believe it is unacceptable that one in four women lose a baby during pregnancy and birth. We want every parent to have the best possible pregnancy outcomes and to take home happy, healthy babies. We fund four research centres in the UK that investigate causes and find treatments for miscarriage, stillbirth and premature birth. Our research centres also have clinics where we provide specialised antenatal care for women who are at high risk of having miscarriage, stillbirth and premature birth. They also have an opportunity to be part of our research through taking part in trials for pioneering new treatments. We are supported by people who want to do something about the lack of research and information around pregnancy issues.

In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year. That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK.

,,"The Trussell Trust","We support a nationwide network of food banks and together we provide emergency food and support to people locked in poverty, and campaign for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year. That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK. If you'd like more information or have any questions about fundraising please don't hesitate to contact us. We'd be delighted to hear from you. ",False,2021-06-25,"2021-07-06 25/2021-07-05 25/2021-07-05 25/2021-07-02 25/2021-06-28 25/2021-06-25 25/2021-06-25 30/2021-06-25 50/2021-06-25 25/2021-06-25 25/2021-06-25 30/2021-06-25 25/2021-06-25 25/2021-06-25 25/2021-06-25 30/2021-06-25 25/2021-06-25 25/2021-06-25 25",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=BankofAmericaSummerGolfleague&pageUrl=5&isTeam=true,2021-07-09,,,520

,,"Duchenne UK","Duchenne UK has one clear aim, to end Duchenne. As the leading Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) charity in the UK, we want to find effective treatments for DMD and end its devastating impact.  We’re going further than anyone has before, and we’re doing it faster, because this generation of people living with DMD can’t wait. The only way we can achieve this is together: we connect the best researchers with industry, the NHS and families to advance and accelerate every stage of drug development.    What is Duchenne muscular dystrophy?   Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive condition diagnosed in childhood. It causes muscles in the body to gradually weaken.  There is currently no cure for DMD, but there is hope. We are at the forefront of advancing treatments and care for everyone affected by the disease.  For more information about our work or DMD please visit our website duchenneuk.org or watch our charity film.      Support us There are lots of ways you can support us. Make a donation on this page, create your own fundraising page, or visit our website to find out about the latest events and challenges you can take part in.     Together, we will end Duchenne.    ",True,,,https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=FoodbuyDuchenne2021&pageUrl=2&isTeam=true,,,,0

As the leading Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) charity in the UK, we want to find effective treatments for DMD and end its devastating impact.  We’re going further than anyone has before, and we’re doing it faster, because this generation of people living with DMD can’t wait. The only way we can achieve this is together: we connect the best researchers with industry, the NHS and families to advance and accelerate every stage of drug development.    What is Duchenne muscular dystrophy?   Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive condition diagnosed in childhood. It causes muscles in the body to gradually weaken.  There is currently no cure for DMD, but there is hope. We are at the forefront of advancing treatments and care for everyone affected by the disease.  For more information about our work or DMD please visit our website duchenneuk.org or watch our charity film.      Support us There are lots of ways you can support us. Make a donation on this page, create your own fundraising page, or visit our website to find out about the latest events and challenges you can take part in.     Together, we will end Duchenne.    ",True,,,https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=FoodbuyDuchenne2021&pageUrl=2&isTeam=true,,,,0

,,"Project Trust","A Year With No Gaps Aged 17-25? Challenge yourself, learn about the world, and be a positive force within it, with Project Trust! Volunteers fundraise for Project Trust, enabling and empowering themselves to experience a meaningful long-term placement in Africa, Asia, or Latin America.  Challenge and Adventure A Project Trust placement is more than an adventure. It is also a responsible, challenging, positive life-enhancing experience, helping develop and hone skills for life beyond those gained through education alone. Project Trust is one of the original international volunteering charities, with Volunteers in placement before NASA put a man on the moon. Since 1967, more than 8,000 young people have explored their potential, experienced cultural exchange, and made a difference to others' lives through their Project Trust placement. As such, Project Trust, based on the Scottish Isle of Coll, is highly respected and widely regarded as a leader in the field of international volunteering. This is by many organisations from across the sector, in the UK and beyond. Education, Youth Development, and Global Citizenship lie at the heart of the work of Project Trust, which strives to be open to all young people with the desire, motivation, and aptitudes required to succeed.  The Next Generation of Global Citizens Project Trust's vision is of empowered generations of young people acting as responsible and active global citizens. Through the opportunities the expert staff team offer, Project Trust is able to empower young people to be confident, effective, creative, independent, and resilient.  Volunteers complete their 12- or 8-month placements with broadened horizons, increased maturity, and a wide range of transferable skills. And it is this unique immersive experience and growth at a formative stage in young people's lives that they carry with them as they step into their next life stages, and beyond. For Volunteers, Project Trust offers or reinforces direction. For many, it is the friendships made that hold the best memories of their adventure.  Find out more  Find out more about the life- and career-enhancing benefits to young people of a Project Trust, and apply, by visiting projecttrust.org.uk/why-volunteer Or speak to the team today via the live website chat, instagram and other social messaging, or by completing the contact us form: projecttrust.org.uk/contact-us    Thank you The Project Trust Team #AYearWithNoGaps  ",False,2020-12-02,"2021-08-02 15/2021-07-11 5/2021-07-11 10/2021-06-23 50/2021-06-18 10/2021-06-15 50/2021-06-04 15/2021-06-04 10/2021-06-03 15/2021-06-03 5/2021-06-03 10/2021-06-03 10/2021-06-03 10/2021-06-02 10/2021-06-02 10/2021-06-01 10/2021-06-01 20/2021-05-31 10/2021-05-31 5/2021-05-31 5/2021-05-04 50/2021-04-25 10/2021-04-20 100/2021-04-08 15/2021-04-03 11/2021-04-03 100/2021-04-03 20/2021-04-02 30/2021-03-29 15/2021-03-26 50/2021-02-16 20/2021-01-30 30/2021-01-27 5/2021-01-25 15/2021-01-16 15/2021-01-16 15/2021-01-13 15/2021-01-10 10/2021-01-06 4/2021-01-05 6/2021-01-05 10/2021-01-05 10/2021-01-05 5/2021-01-04 5/2021-01-03 5/2021-01-03 8/2021-01-03 5/2021-01-03 10/2021-01-01 30/2020-12-25 25/2020-12-20 10/2020-12-14 5/2020-12-13 10/2020-12-13 5/2020-12-13 50/2020-12-13 10/2020-12-13 20/2020-12-13 40/2020-12-13 10/2020-12-13 5/2020-12-13 10/2020-12-13 50/2020-12-13 5/2020-12-13 10/2020-12-13 5/2020-12-13 5/2020-12-13 50/2020-12-13 5/2020-12-13 5/2020-12-02 1/2020-12-02 20/2020-12-02 10",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=EilidhBanks&pageUrl=1,2021-08-02,,,1356

,,VICTA,"VICTA is a national charity that provides support to children and young people who are blind or partially sighted and their families. We believe that everyone has the right to an independent and fulfilling life. VICTA’s support, advice, grants and activities enable young people and their families to build skills, develop confidence and help each other toward a more positive future. Founded in 1987, VICTA has grown from a local support group into a national charity. VICTA was born out of the sense of empowerment a group of families found when they came together to ensure that their children were given the same opportunities as sighted children. Today, VICTA works hard to involve children and young people who are blind or partially sighted so they are able to make a difference to their own lives. www.victa.org.uk",True,2020-01-23,"2020-02-01 15/2020-01-31 15/2020-01-29 15/2020-01-29 15/2020-01-29 20/2020-01-23 10/2020-01-23 10",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=LauraBanks6&pageUrl=1,2020-02-01,,,100

But one in three of us will still get cancer at some point in our lives. Our groundbreaking work, funded entirely by the public, will help ensure that millions more people will survive.

,,Miracles,"  Hello and welcome to the Virgin Money Giving account for Miracles. Being told your child has a life changing or life limiting illness is devastating. If you live in poverty, it can literally rip your family apart.  Additional financial burdens can quickly mount up and become overwhelming – sending the family into irreversible debt.   For the past 25 years Miracles has been there to help relieve those burdens from families living in poverty and facing a crisis. We can help solve an immediate crisis through rapid and practical support. We can take away some of the pressure they are under and help create space for the family to focus on recovery, on their children and on dealing with the day to day issues of living in poverty. Here’s How Miracles Works Miracles’Rapid Response Crisis Funding:           Miracles provide grants to cover a broad spectrum of issues from hospital travel to specialised equipment; through the funding of food and clothing, to helping to halt evictions and reconnecting essential household facilities.  With the current stringent cuts in welfare benefits, more and more  families are turning to Miracles as their only means of survival. We also provide special treats for the many siblings who tend to get overlooked when a brother or sister is critically ill.  Miracles’ Respite Breaks: For families with severely sick and disabled children undergoing or recovering from hospital treatment, Miracles provides Respite Breaks in its caravan (specially equipped for the disabled) situated on the Bunn Leisure Holiday Complex in Selsey, West Sussex. Miracles provides the caravans free of charge with all the holiday facilities on-site, plus welfare grants for travel, food and even a bit of spending money. A respite break can help families come to terms with a difficult prognosis as well as help in the healing process Miracles' Feed London: Feed London is our response to the desperate food poverty crisis taking place amongst children and young people in London - exacerbated by COVID - 19 - specifically during the school holidays when so many children’s access to a hot meal has been stopped. In particular we wanted to support children living in those regions with the highest rates of child poverty - at present the top 10 are all in London. We provide each family with a vital Food Box packed full of enough fresh and healthy ingredients to make seven main meals along with recipes, a supermarket voucher, creative activity sets for children and lots of treats. For the summer holiday we aim to include hygiene kits plus local 'whats on?' guides for families in their areas as well as vouchers for days out to London attractions.

,,"The Trussell Trust","We support a nationwide network of food banks and together we provide emergency food and support to people locked in poverty, and campaign for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year. That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK. If you'd like more information or have any questions about fundraising please don't hesitate to contact us. We'd be delighted to hear from you. ",False,2021-02-26,"2021-08-05 11/2021-08-04 5/2021-08-03 3/2021-08-03 5/2021-08-03 2/2021-08-03 5/2021-08-03 25/2021-08-02 2/2021-07-29 2/2021-07-28 15/2021-07-27 5/2021-07-27 3/2021-07-27 15/2021-07-27 10/2021-07-27 5/2021-07-26 5/2021-07-23 5/2021-07-23 2/2021-07-20 10/2021-07-20 10/2021-07-20 5/2021-07-20 15/2021-07-02 5/2021-06-25 20/2021-06-25 20/2021-06-25 20/2021-06-22 10/2021-06-22 5/2021-06-21 10/2021-06-21 15/2021-06-21 10/2021-06-18 5/2021-06-18 21/2021-06-17 10/2021-06-17 25/2021-06-17 10/2021-06-17 10/2021-06-17 10/2021-06-17 5/2021-06-17 10/2021-06-17 10/2021-06-17 5/2021-06-17 30/2021-06-17 4/2021-06-16 5/2021-06-15 4/2021-06-15 10/2021-06-14 5/2021-06-10 5/2021-06-10 10/2021-06-10 4/2021-06-10 5/2021-06-10 5/2021-06-09 5/2021-06-08 5/2021-06-07 10/2021-06-01 30/2021-05-28 5/2021-05-28 5/2021-05-28 10/2021-05-28 10/2021-05-28 10/2021-05-27 5/2021-05-26 4/2021-05-26 5/2021-05-25 5/2021-05-25 10/2021-05-24 15/2021-05-24 5/2021-05-24 5/2021-05-24 10/2021-05-24 5/2021-05-06 50/2021-05-06 20/2021-05-06 65/2021-04-30 5/2021-04-30 5/2021-04-30 10/2021-04-08 5/2021-04-08 10/2021-04-08 5/2021-04-07 2/2021-04-07 5/2021-04-06 5/2021-04-06 30/2021-04-01 20/2021-04-01 20/2021-04-01 20/2021-03-29 20/2021-03-29 10/2021-03-29 10/2021-03-26 30/2021-03-25 10/2021-03-25 20/2021-03-23 5/2021-03-23 15/2021-03-22 15/2021-03-22 2/2021-03-22 10/2021-03-19 10/2021-03-19 30/2021-03-19 5/2021-03-19 15/2021-03-19 5/2021-03-19 5/2021-03-19 1/2021-03-19 5/2021-03-19 2/2021-03-19 5/2021-03-18 2/2021-03-17 5/2021-03-17 10/2021-03-17 30/2021-03-17 5/2021-03-16 40/2021-03-16 5/2021-03-15 10/2021-03-15 5/2021-03-15 5/2021-03-12 2/2021-03-12 5/2021-03-12 30/2021-03-12 10/2021-03-12 15/2021-03-12 10/2021-03-12 5/2021-03-12 15/2021-03-12 10/2021-03-12 5/2021-03-11 10/2021-03-11 5/2021-03-11 5/2021-03-01 5/2021-02-26 10",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=GlobalBankingTechnologyBromleyTeam&pageUrl=1&isTeam=true,2021-08-05,,,1554
