Just in the last few months we have rehoused 7 people who have come on to the bus and now rehoused in local hostels with one who now has his own room in a shared property and back working full time.     We also run a community food bank which is a vital service for those who need emergency food parcels.     We have proven the bus to work but with winter here our furniture sales have slowed down and we really need some funding in to least cover us for the next few months so we can keep the bus running.     I have put our costs below  all money is spent on keeping our services running.     Unit & storage rent: £500 this is where our bus is parked and also our storage container.   Telephone & internet system: £20 per month. This is for our landline number for people to get in touch with us.  Petrol: £100 a month to help with volunteers cars.   Waste collection: £20 a month   Portaloo: £25 a week plus vat - we need to get one down yard so we have two toilets on site.   Insurance: £110 a month.   Other costs: around £300 monthly this could be things like topping up first aid box  topping up equipment on the bus or carrying out dbs checks.   These are our main costs we need to cover every month just to run if you could please make a donation and share.   You can see what we do on our Facebook page Norwich Homeless Support.       ",False

No amount is too small and sharing would mean the world to me    When I moved to London I moved because I had nowhere else to go and I had to study to get out of where I was living. Trying to study through the last two years of life as it’s known added with transitioning proved too hard and as a result I had failed my studies and this has left me house less and without my guaranteed income of student support.    I’m raising this amount this amount to cover a deposit and some amount of rent with trying to move my things I still own. Again no amount is too small and it all adds up and it will mean the world to me so thank you if you get this far and choose to support with a share or donation.    Things are getting worse and soon could be looking at being completely homeless with no place or plan. Just reading or sharing this would help me and also mean the world   ",False

Unfortunately this had not happened by time we were to be out and we have had to move into our caravan and I thank god we had it. We are in a caravan park but it's an hour away from kids school and takes us 2 hours twice a day there and back costing alot of petrol as well  it's not ideal and a situation I do not want my children to be in especially with winter coming in. We need to get a private rent and council will then help with some of the rent but we do not have the deposit and first month rent to pay upfront and we are in need of purchasing some second hand furniture as not everything in the previous home was ours. I hate being in this situation but for my children I am in need of help. Thank you for all your support and taking time to read this.",False

Homelessness in the UK is a never ending  viscious cycle. We never know how someone ends up sleeping rough  and we should never judge them for the reasons they are in this situation.   Temperatures are dropping and Christmas is approaching. Whilst many of us will enjoy a hot meal and presents  games and fun with families  gathered around the TV watching films and drinking hot chocolates  many people will be sleeping in below freezing temperatures  wondering whether they are going to wake up the next morning  where they are going to get food or a warm drink from  where they are going to sleep for the winter  and so on. I have spoken to lots of homeless people. Many  have had their homes (tents  sleeping bags) set on fire or destroyed by heartless  evil human beings. Why make that person's situation any worse than it already is?!   I am asking for donations toward a fundraiser this year. With this money  I am hoping to put together a box of items per person which might be useful for someone sleeping rough. Hats  gloves  blankets  foil blankets  food  hand warmers  sanitary products for both men and women  essentials such as toothbrushes  hairbrushes  these will be handed out to anyone I can find and I will be doing this over a weekend leading up to Christmas  anything left over I will be giving to a charity close to my heart.   Please  make a difference to someone this Christmas  who needs it most. This country is a rich and giving country  but we still fail to acknowledge those who need our attention the most. Be kind  be thoughtful  and don't judge anyone based on their situation.   With love  Ellen ",False
