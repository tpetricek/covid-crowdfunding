,,,1110522,"The Trussell Trust",False,2019-11-28,"<div></div><div dir=""auto"">This festive season we’re building on the successes of the previous two years and raising money for the Trussell Trust — a brilliant charity that helps thousands of people in the UK feed their families in times of crisis via foodbanks. Last year, the Trussell Trust network gave out over 1.6 million three-day emergency food supplies to people in need, that’s a 19% increase on the previous financial year.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">When we started raising money for the Trussell Trust in 2017, 13 million people were living below the poverty line. Two years on, this number has grown to 14 million. People are going hungry every day for a range of reasons, from benefit delays (due to a drastically underfunded switch to universal basic income) to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. This number is growing for a multitude of reasons but the responsibility lies in the same place each time. Our current government is failing us.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">Winter is always the busiest period for foodbanks, so we’d like your help to raise as much cash as possible. A tin of beans costs as little as 30p, so any donation you make however small or large will really help!</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">We wish that each year we wouldn't need to fundraise for this cause, it shouldn’t be down to the Trussell Trust (and many other similar organisations), there should be a system that supports and cares for people.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">Please share this on all of your social platforms to help us achieve our goal. Then, on December the 12th please vote for a change — the right are failing us all, but most importantly, they're failing those who are in need of a social care system that works.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">Thank you, we couldn’t do this without you!</div><div><br></div><div><div><div><div><font color=""#3a3a3a""></font></div></div></div></div>",73,73,"2020-01-11 10/2019-12-24 15/2019-12-19 7/2019-12-19 10/2019-12-17 30/2019-12-16 10/2019-12-14 25/2019-12-14 20/2019-12-14 20/2019-12-14 20/2019-12-14 10/2019-12-13 20/2019-12-13 20/2019-12-12 10/2019-12-12 50/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 10/2019-12-10 10/2019-12-10 50/2019-12-10 10/2019-12-10 20/2019-12-10 20/2019-12-10 30/2019-12-09 20/2019-12-09 20/2019-12-07 20/2019-12-07 10/2019-12-06 25/2019-12-05 10/2019-12-05 5/2019-12-05 20/2019-12-03 20/2019-12-03 20/2019-12-03 5/2019-12-03 20/2019-12-02 25/2019-12-02 10/2019-12-01 20/2019-12-01 10/2019-11-30 15/2019-11-29 25/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 40/2019-11-29 100/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 50/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 15/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-28 15/2019-11-28 30/2019-11-28 10/2019-11-28 10/2019-11-28 50",https://www.justgiving.com/Foodbank2019,2020-01-11,1507,1500,"Festive Food Bank Fundraiser 2019"

Latest figures by Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 177% increase in the number of people supported with 3-day emergency food parcels compared to May of last year.

Humanity First has set up its first UK Food Bank in Mirfield, West Yorkshire. A further roll out of other food banks is expected later this year. With local support they have managed to distribute food parcels to individuals and families as well as other food banks and organisations reaching a large number of people. 

However, to increase and expand the operation much needed donations required.

Non-perishable food can be dropped off at Tonbridge Baptist Church 9.30am-4.30pm Monday to Friday.  However, the current need exceeds the supply of donated items.  This appeal will help us purchase additional food items when they are needed most.</span></p><p><span>We are concerned about the impact of the Coronavirus outbreak on those needing to use food banks and we are taking extra measures to ensure the most vulnerable in our community can still access food.</span></p><p></p><p>Each week SUSTAIN provides an average of 80 emergency food parcels. A family parcel costs £50 and an individual parcel costs £25 to put together, a total cost of between £2,000 - £2,500 each week.&nbsp; Your donation would go towards ensuring we can continue to provide emergency food during this difficult time.</p><p>All donations to SUSTAIN are ring fenced and restricted for the work of SUSTAIN.</p><p></p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

,,,229410,"Hornsey Parochial Charities",False,2020-04-01,"<p><span>We are an independent local foodbank in Hornsey, which opens once a week to give food to local residents in need. We do not operate a voucher system, anybody who feels they need it can use our service. We try to offer fresh as well as non-perishable food where we can. Over the summer we have been located in Campsbourne School, and from September we will be located in Middle Lane Methodist Church. We grew out of Hornsey Mutual Aid, a group of local residents set up to help people in need during the COVID-19 Pandemic. We noticed a high degree of food poverty, and no foodbanks operate in the Hornsey area, so we got together to start this foodbank. All proceeds will go towards supporting the food bank. We are a very new venture, and while we work towards setting up our own structures, Hornsey Parochial Charities are kindly holding our money for us.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><br></p>",35,35,"2020-10-18 50/2020-10-08 50/2020-09-27 20/2020-08-28 100/2020-08-22 50/2020-08-17 30/2020-08-17 30/2020-08-15 20/2020-08-04 10/2020-08-04 20/2020-08-03 30/2020-08-01 20/2020-07-26 30/2020-07-25 100/2020-04-15 350/2020-04-14 30/2020-04-14 50/2020-04-14 50/2020-04-13 100/2020-04-12 30/2020-04-08 30/2020-04-07 30/2020-04-07 10/2020-04-07 20/2020-04-06 20/2020-04-06 30/2020-04-02 10/2020-04-02 10/2020-04-01 30",https://www.justgiving.com/Benjamin-Kerridge3,2020-10-18,1645,1500,"Hornsey Food Bank"

With local support they have managed to distribute food parcels to individuals and families as well as other food banks and organisations reaching a large number of people. 

However, to increase and expand the operation much needed donations required.

Normal people became extraordinary and developed heroic qualities. These short stories are of those real people, living a real life but in very unusual times when they suddenly found themselves faced with an unknown and invisible enemy.</p><p><span>Initially unsure, of how to continue with any normality but then finding an inspirational role for themselves. It is those people who became the inspiration for the me and the idea of the book originated. ‘Stirring Inspirational stories’ is sectioned into 2 parts.</span><br></p><p><span>The first part of the book is an anthology of short stories written during the days of the lockdown. I have written life stories of people that I was inspired by during this time. I feel that I did not need to search for them too far or wide. They were people around me : friends, neighbours, and family. These extraordinary people showed courage and selfless service, or they experimented and got creative in their kitchens or gardens.  These real-life stories will certainly inspire you as we face the realities of the new normal.</span><br></p><p><span>The second part of the book contains a range of recipes that were tried and tested in their kitchens during these times. I was compelled to include these mouth-watering dishes in this book. The recipes, consist of a fusion of contributors’ cultural experiences and varied cooking styles and ingredients.</span><br></p><p><span>Now sit back... read stories of real people, and be inspired. Do not forget to take a break. Bake a cake and try other fanciful recipes from the tried and tested list. I hope you will be absorbed in double consumption: where inspired compassion stirs culinary delights!</span><br></p><p><span>I've decided to dedicate all funds (Amazon have to charge for me to publish on their platform) raised for my eBook to The Trussell Trust. This is because during the lockdown,</span><span>&nbsp;food banks in this network provided more than 1.6 million emergency food parcels to people in crisis and they continue to provide this exceptional service .

Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

This whole pandemic nonsense will hit those on low to no incomes the hardest and, right now, it’s tricky enough to find some of life’s essentials in the shops when you <i>can</i> afford them.</p><p>So as I sat here at home, unravelling at the prospect of being on lockdown, stuck inside, having to move house and have building work done in the midst of all of this, I realised I was being a bit of a whiny bitch. So, in a not entirely selfless effort to take back some control and maybe put a Kit-kat in a hungry mouth, I’ve decided to buzz off my hair for charity.</p><p>Specifically, The Trussell Trust, who support a nationwide network of food banks, including one in Cheltenham.

It’s like blood money but scratchier.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve never buzzed my hair off before, and I’m fairly sure I’ll look ridiculous, so there’s your incentive.

This is a bit nuts. A lot nuts actually. See the picture of the blue football shirt? Well, it ain't just any football shirt. It is a Scotland shirt for the discerning, patriotic smaller Scottish dog. Believe it or not we have had forty of these donated and they are all in serious need of a good home.</p><p>Well in&nbsp;a few days time Scotland will be taking on the Auld Enemy at Wembley and your wee pooch must be desperate to wear the colours. So here's the good news. If you were to give any kind of donation to this page one of these canine shirts might just find its way to you in the post so long as you give me a bell on 077770 443483 to sort it out.</p><p>Yeah, I know. But these are times when frontline charities like First Base need to clutch at every straw we can find!</p><p><strong>ABOUT ME LIVING OFF ONE OF OUR FOOD PARCELS.</strong></p><p>I really don't want to make any kind of big deal out of what I'm doing here! I guess in a way I am about to put my money where my mouth is. In September I will live off one of the First Base Agency's emergency food parcels for half a week.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the picture above. I know. It isn't going to be so very hard, right?. And it shouldn't be so very hard. All of us at First Base are pretty proud of the emergency food parcels we have been handing out for the last 13 years. We are very much aware that the REALLY hard part of living off emergency food is being in a position where you NEED to live off emergency food. It is a very bleak place indeed to find yourself in. We see this every single day in the eyes of those who come into First Base.</p><p>I am lucky. I don't need emergency food. Not right now at least. So I am not asking for your support for any kind of recognition of me doing something remotely difficult. Instead I am asking for support for something much more profound. Over the coming eight months of winter over 3000 people will come through the doors of First Base. Each and every one of them will be in the miserable position of finding themselves unable to buy food to eat. And we will all do our very best to make sure each and every person who comes to us will leave the building with a bag full of the kind of food I am about to live off for a few days.</p><p>But there is a problem. A pretty big problem. As I write these words we have enough funding in place to just about keep the doors open until the end of December. Then nothing. January nothing. February nothing. March nothing. Three long, cold winter months when hundreds and hundreds of people will need us to be there to provide emergency food.</p><p>Sadly this is a problem we are only too familiar with. Every frontline charity in Britain knows how it is to live on the edge of a funding cliff. It is hard and it is stressful. Our local community is utterly amazing when it comes to donating food. Last year we received over £40,000's worth. When I spend my three days eating emergency food I will be lucky enough to have a fresh loaf of bread donated by Greggs and a pack of ham donated by Brown Brothers. The list of our food donors is a long one and we feel honoured to be supported by so many.</p><p>However the bags of food that arrive every day will never pay our electric bill. Or the phone bill. Or the rent. Or wages. Or the detailed accounts we are legally and rightly obliged to produce for the charity regulator. Or fuel in the tank to deliver made up food parcels to the 20 collection points we bow have across the region.</p><p>These are the boring bills which cover the nuts and bolts of keeping the doors of any front line charity open. They are boring but unavoidable. And the money to cover these boring bills is our life blood. By hook or by crook we need to find £20,000 before the end of March to ensure our doors stay open. It won't be easy. Anything but. However it is a situation we are only too familiar with. We have faced down this kind of funding crisis many times over the last 13 years and we are confident of doing so again. Never once have we turned away a single person who has come to us for emergency food. Not once. We're all pretty proud of that record and we have no intention of allowing such a thing to happen in the coming winter.</p><p>So. How can you help? Well there are two options. Of course you can donate a few quid on this page and if you do so we will be hugely appreciative. Or maybe you might want to go a stage further and do exactly what I am doing - live off a First Base emergency food parcel for half a week and raise so cash either with a page like this one or by using more traditional sponsorship forms. So how would that work? Easy. You can call me on either 07770 443483 or 01387 279680 or you can e mail me at markglenmill@aol.com. I will then deliver you a three day food parcel and sponsorship forms should you need any. Tell you what. I'll throw in a full signed set of my back list of books as a thank you. Then it is a case of eating emergency food for three days and chasing in a few donations.&nbsp;</p><p>So that's that I guess. Please support us either by donating to this page or by starting up a page of your own. Maybe I will see you soon with a box of food and a bag of books!</p><p>All the best</p><p>Mark</p>",127,2,"2020-03-31 20/2018-05-23 60",https://www.justgiving.com/MarkSimonFrankland,2020-03-31,12556,15000,"I'm raising cash to make sure the First Base food bank survives the winter"
,,,1140963,"FAST UK",False,2017-10-06,"<p>For the past three years FAST UK has helped to finance an emergency food bank for some of the poorest people and families living in the Rroma village called Apalina on the outskirts of Reghin. So far the charity has helped to feed over 200 families but we would love to help more!</p><p>After a past visit we were asked for some help by Pastor Attila Toth who informed us that many families within this village were trying to survive on just one or two small meals per week. In the summer months it is possible for families to survive on gleanings from locally grown crops but in winter with temperatures often dropping to as low as -32 degrees centigrade with snow on the floor this makes this way of living almost impossible.</p><p>With the money raised on this page as a charity we will send money to Attila so that he is able to purchase good basic food locally in Reghin. All of the food purchased will be given out to the most needy families according to the need.&nbsp;</p><p>On a recent visit this summer that I was on Attila told one of our trustees that the funds provided over the past few years have enabled people to have enough to eat through the harsh winters and in a few cases even prevent people from starving to death. After seeing the people living within the village in September 2017 and hearing many families stories, I feel very passionate about helping them and would love you to as well!</p><p>Currently the total we send to the food bank is £1500.00 per year but we would love to send more if possible so more people can be helped. The £1500.00 we give feeds approx 200 through the long winters which amounts to about £10 per person to see them through the whole winter period. This money not only enables people to eat but also to have a much easier time throughout the winter months as this is often the hardest time for families living in such a difficult environment and with so little.&nbsp;</p><p>Can you help some on eat well this winter for just £10?</p><p><font color=""#212121"">If you can help then that would be fantastic, remember&nbsp;no matter how much you can donate, every pound helps to feed a person for a day, week, month and winter.</font></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

I recently signed up to volunteer for one of Urban Community Projects' initiatives, the Camden Mobile Food Bank, to deliver food donations to vulnerable families who live on local estates. I signed up for the initiative because of 2 major reasons:<br><br>1) More so than ever, this is a time when&nbsp;the recipients&nbsp;really need our help as many of them, be it the elderly or ill,&nbsp;are confined to their homes and are unable to collect the food parcels themselves. &nbsp;<br><br>2) I myself have been fortunate enough to be a recipient of other people's generosity of time and financial resources, and I know from firsthand experience that a small act of kindness has the power to make a significant difference to another individual's life.&nbsp;To the extent that I&nbsp;am able to, I would like to keep this 'cycle of generosity' alive. <br><br>I am appealing to you because alongside my volunteering to deliver food, I&nbsp;have created a page&nbsp;to help raise funds for <em>Urban Community Projects </em>so that the charity is able to continue carrying out essential services to vulnerable members of our community, at a time when it is most needed. If you are able to, I ask that you please donate through the&nbsp;<em>Just Giving&nbsp; </em>website to&nbsp;support <em>Urban Community Projects</em>. <br><br>I will match your donations by committing to&nbsp;doing as many food delivery trips as I can possibly squeeze in outside of my work hours. &nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance.<br>Sello </p>",57,57,"2020-07-10 30/2020-06-23 20/2020-06-17 20/2020-06-10 50/2020-06-09 50/2020-05-29 50/2020-05-18 50/2020-05-12 100/2020-05-07 30/2020-05-06 30/2020-05-04 50/2020-05-04 15/2020-05-04 50/2020-05-03 30/2020-05-01 100/2020-04-29 100/2020-04-25 50/2020-04-25 30/2020-04-21 20/2020-04-21 200/2020-04-21 30/2020-04-21 100/2020-04-21 100/2020-04-21 25/2020-04-20 20/2020-04-20 50/2020-04-19 30/2020-04-19 20/2020-04-17 50/2020-04-17 100/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 10/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 50/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 20/2020-04-16 50/2020-04-15 40/2020-04-15 20/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-15 50/2020-04-15 50/2020-04-15 20/2020-04-15 20",https://www.justgiving.com/Sello-Lekalakala,2020-07-10,5475,5000,"A Helping Hand "

As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.</p>",95,95,"2020-05-16 10/2020-05-08 5/2020-05-07 10/2020-05-05 10/2020-05-05 10/2020-05-05 10/2020-05-01 10/2020-05-01 10/2020-04-30 10/2020-04-29 5/2020-04-28 5/2020-04-28 10/2020-04-27 10/2020-04-27 5/2020-04-27 5/2020-04-27 2/2020-04-27 5/2020-04-27 10/2020-04-27 10/2020-04-26 5/2020-04-26 5/2020-04-26 10/2020-04-26 10/2020-04-26 5/2020-04-26 5/2020-04-26 10/2020-04-26 10/2020-04-25 5/2020-04-25 5/2020-04-25 10/2020-04-25 10/2020-04-25 10/2020-04-25 5/2020-04-25 35/2020-04-25 5/2020-04-25 5/2020-04-25 10/2020-04-25 10/2020-04-25 5/2020-04-25 5/2020-04-25 10/2020-04-25 5/2020-04-25 5/2020-04-25 10/2020-04-25 10/2020-04-25 10/2020-04-25 20/2020-04-24 10/2020-04-24 10/2020-04-24 5/2020-04-24 10/2020-04-24 10/2020-04-24 15/2020-04-23 10/2020-04-23 5/2020-04-23 10/2020-04-23 20/2020-04-23 50/2020-04-23 10/2020-04-23 10/2020-04-23 5/2020-04-23 5/2020-04-22 5/2020-04-22 5/2020-04-22 5/2020-04-22 5/2020-04-22 5/2020-04-22 5/2020-04-22 10/2020-04-22 5/2020-04-22 5/2020-04-22 10/2020-04-22 10/2020-04-21 10/2020-04-21 10/2020-04-21 4/2020-04-21 4/2020-04-21 5/2020-04-21 15/2020-04-21 10/2020-04-21 5/2020-04-21 5/2020-04-21 5/2020-04-21 5/2020-04-21 5/2020-04-21 10/2020-04-21 5",https://www.justgiving.com/Zaida-Rey,2020-05-16,815,50,"Lilianas daily 3 mile fancy dress bike ride"

Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

I think the numbers of people being helped have jumped from around 25 to 110 per week. They have already had some very kind donations but, as you can imagine, the demand is using up the money fast.

The main earner was self-employed and his business had been forced to stop. As you may know, that means the family will not receive support until June. The lady that answered the door ended up in tears as she explained that she never expected to be in this situation. I have to admit it was very moving to hear her story but thank goodness the Foodbank has been able to help.

The dogs were welcome in and I sat alone in the corner waiting for my husband to pick me up when I got talking to a stranger. One hour later it transpires that the guy was an ex- serviceman who due to PTS had found himself living locally in a tent, we got talking and although his life was tough he took nothing from the government but did odd jobs in order to provide for himself. I brought him a pint and later my son and husband turned up, he offered to buy us all a drink which I decided as we were driving, he still came back from the bar with three orange juices. We have so much and he has nothing but yet he still brought us a drink which he could not afford. We all have so much in life and yet others have nothing and yet they are willing to share what they have! My son learnt so much tonight, on the way home he asked if we could give all his old toys to other people for Christmas that didn't have things for Christmas! Tomorrow I am off to do a weeks shop and leave it with the landlord to give to that man as last night was a truly moving experience not just for me but for my entire family!

The situation has made life very hard for many, especially farmers who depend on their livestock.<br></span></span></p><p><span><span>One farmer mentioned how 'the water kept on rising'. He, his family nor his cattle could go out. They needed a small boat to get about. They could not cook on their cooker or sleep on their own beds as it has gone underwater. This is just a story of one farmer. Can you imagine how many stories you will hear when talking to the 1 million people who have had to move away from their homes as there's nothing left.<br></span></span></p><p><span><span>The flooding has ruined crops and people's livelihoods even for what little they had. Now more than a million are on the move.<br></span></span></p><p><span><span>Bangladesh's Flood Forecast Centre has warned the situation could get worse with major rivers expecting to rise in the coming days.<br></span></span></p><p><span><span>This is why iQra International Bangladesh team have been on the ground assisting and helping as many people as they possibly can with medical kits, food, household supplies and more.
