This could be Social Workers, Health Visitors, GP’s, Schools, Citizen Advice Bureau and many of the voluntary organisations working in the area. The food (all long life) is generously donated by local people at supermarket collections, Churches, schools and local businesses.  We serve people of all faith groups and beliefs or none. We are passionate about inclusion and being non-judgemental is central to what we do. We believe that everyone has the right to have food on their plate, dignity and hope for the future.  The Foodbank would not be able to function without a fabulous team of volunteers who sort the stock, provide a welcoming face to those in need and take part in supermarket collections and other community events.",False,2020-05-10,"2020-06-19 10/2020-06-12 30/2020-05-27 125/2020-05-25 50/2020-05-17 15/2020-05-15 50/2020-05-14 100/2020-05-13 30/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 30/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-10 30",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=WeybridgeCovidFoodbankAppeal&pageUrl=1,2020-09-20,"Throughout Wales",,575

,"56 Alleyn Road,  London,  SE21 8AH","Norwood and Brixton Foodbank Limited","  The Norwood and Brixton Foodbank is part of the Trussell Trust network of foodbanks that provide essential food and toiletries to people in crisis. The Foodbank was formed in September 2011 with the support and encouragement of a number of local churches. Having established distribution points in West Norwood, Brixton and Streatham the foodbank regularly feeds 10,000 people in poverty each year. Over 70 tonnes of food is needed to meet the need in our community and your donation will help us towards meeting that goal. **Corona Virus Update: Since the outbreak of Covid-19 we have adapted our parcel distribution model to ensure the safety of our clients and staff. We have developed a delivery service shipping parcels directly from our Streatham warehouse to our client's homes. Despite the huge logistical challenge this presents, and an estimated 400% increase in demand, we have still been able to provide essential food parcels to all those referred to us. Thank you for your continued donations that are making this possible**  ",True,,,https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=4LFoodbankchallenge&pageUrl=1&isTeam=true,,,,0

We also make a daily delivery to the MAGPAS Air Ambulance based at Wyton and East Anglian Air Ambulance based at Cambridge Airport.&nbsp; Our volunteers operate from 7pm at night until 6am weekdays, all day and night at weekends and on Bank Holidays. Since this voluntary organisation started in 2010 providing a vitally important service completely free of charge, we have carried out more than 7000 delivery runs, which last year it is estimated to have saved the NHS over £80,000 allowing the NHS to divert funds where they are needed most. Our hospitals make between 2 and 7 calls per night to us and our duty controllers liaise with our volunteers and similar organisations throughout the UK to complete the task requested.  We have just over 100 dedicated volunteers who give their time, mostly use their own motorcycles or cars and pay for their own fuel. SERV Suffolk and Cambridgeshire receives no government funding, its costs being met by donations from members of the public, local businesses, charitable grants and awards. We do not have any paid staff. Our main costs include supplying our volunteers with safety equipment, insurance and maintenance for our charity vehicles and paying for communications between our hospitals and ourselves.  In 2019 we have committed to replacing our two aging fund-raising team vehicles.  One based in Cambridgeshire and one based in Suffolk.  It is estimated that this cost will be £30 000.  In 2019, SERV Suffolk and Cambridgeshire were awarded the Queen's Award for Voluntary Services for providing free transport of essential blood products, samples and donated breast milk to hospitals and air ambulances.  This award is the equivalent to an MBE and is the highest award a voluntary group can receive in the UK.",False,2020-10-05,"2020-10-16 20/2020-10-16 10/2020-10-16 20/2020-10-15 100/2020-10-15 10/2020-10-14 20/2020-10-14 10/2020-10-14 100/2020-10-14 100/2020-10-09 20/2020-10-09 15/2020-10-09 10/2020-10-09 20/2020-10-07 25/2020-10-07 20/2020-10-07 20/2020-10-07 10/2020-10-07 3/2020-10-05 25/2020-10-05 100",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=CurtisBanksTeamSales&pageUrl=1&isTeam=true,2020-10-16,"Throughout Wales",,673

That money comes almost entirely from voluntary contributions - legacies, donations, the FORCE charity shop and from fundraising events. Fantastic support from the community we serve enables FORCE to fulfil its mission to support anyone locally affected by cancer. If you would like to learn more about the work of FORCE, please call 01392 402875.

For far too long, men affected by prostate cancer have been overlooked. Research has been severely under-funded meaning the medical advances in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer lag far behind most other cancers. We believe that men deserve better. The future starts here, with you. Prostate Cancer UK fights to help more men survive prostate cancer and enjoy a better quality of life. We find answers by funding ground-breaking research into causes and treatments, we lead change by riasing the profile of the disease and improving care. And we support men by providing vital information and services: The only UK-wide telephone and email helpline dedicated to prostate cancer, staffed by our specialist nurses. Award winning publications– free, factual and tailored information One-to-one peer support– we connect people confronting prostate cancer with volunteers who have had a similar experience. Online community– men, their partners and families can talk together through a members’ message board    Prostate Cancer UK is here for every man and every family who needs our help.

,"School Of Modern Langs & Cultures,University Of Durham  Elvet Riverside,New Elvet  DH1 3JT","Ruth First Educational Trust"," The RFET supports the Ruth First Scholarship at Durham University for students from southern Africa. We award one scholarship per year for a taught Masters degree. A South African undergraduate scholarship was set up by staff and students at Durham University in 1964, the year in which Nelson Mandela was imprisoned and the anti-apartheid campaigner, journalist and researcher Ruth First was forced to go into exile in England. The scholarship was named in honour of Ruth First after she was murdered by South African police in 1982. She was a Lecturer in Sociology at Durham University and had been seconded to Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique. Since the end of apartheid, the Scholarship has been awarded for postgraduate study, and in 2007 we widened its scope to include applicants from Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. We choose people who show evidence of both academic promise and community leadership. People who have been active in voluntary and charity work, community initiatives, health and educational projects. Ruth First Scholars make the most of the amazing opportunity of enhancing their skills and knowledge at a leading UK university to benefit not only themselves but their communities and countries. The Ruth First Scholarship is supported by Durham University, Durham County Council and other sponsors, as well as by individual donations from staff and alumni of the University and people from the Durham area. However, we urgently need to increase the Trust's income in order to ensure that this small but powerful contribution to development in southern Africa can continue. Please make a one-off or regular donation, or support one of our fundraising events through this website.

"Welfare support to ex RAF Cranwell Apprentices","Unit 12 New Lairdship Yards,Broomhouse Road  Edinburgh,Midlothian  EH11 3UY","Edinburgh Food Project","Edinburgh Food Project (EFP) are a local independant charity (SC043220) and are a member of, but are not funded by, the Trussell Trust network. EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by one full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.   EFP operates 7 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme. Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances. Each food pack provides at least three meals for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave). In 2018-19, we provided 11,495 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 19.6% increase on the previous year. We were able to do so by receiving 130,000kg of food from public donations. Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps. Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres.  Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.

EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by one full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.   EFP operates 7 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme. Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances. Each food pack provides at least three meals for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave). In 2018-19, we provided 11,495 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 19.6% increase on the previous year. We were able to do so by receiving 130,000kg of food from public donations. Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps. Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres.  Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.

,"18 Hamilton Road,Southville  Bristol,  BS3 1PB",Temwa,"Temwa is a UK-based organisation that raises funds to implement community-based projects in Malawi. Temwa operates in an area called Nkhata Bay North, on the shores of Lake Malawi.  This remote region of 39,000 people has no electricity, no running water and is severely affected by the HIV & AIDS epidemic. There are no other NGOs (non-governmental organisations) working in the region and the local government strongly encouraged Temwa to work in this area due to its desperate need for basic development.
