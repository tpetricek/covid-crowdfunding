Since then GFTH have set up a full time foodbank and in the past two years have served over 15 000 meals and over 3000 free food parcels to the homeless  vulnerable and those needing a helping hand.

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.    All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.    If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free. Thankyou for your support.    The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need  providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.    All the best    Jack Monroe.

This support started when there was no halal food support in the local area of Sharrow and Netheredge and people were struggling to buy basic food for themselves. Due to a gap in the area and a desperate need TSY collaborated with few others to collectively reach out to the most vulnerable including single parents  elderly  self isolating and hardship such as loss of income. All our work is voluntary and since March kind donations from local community has assisted us in making sure no one struggled alone. We are running low on cash donations to purchase food to continue this vital support and are reaching out to anyone who can support us by using this link and donating whatever little they can towards the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank project. Due to the level of need and referrals coming in since the start of this halal foodbank  we have called it Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank to avoid any barriers to any non-muslim vulnerable that maybe in need of this support.

(Please support and please share)    Inchgarth has now launched the second phase of our gofundme campaign to support people during the covid-19 pandemic following your wonderful support during 2020.  We know that for many families  individuals  and businesses that things are extremely tough just now  but for those who may be able to donate a couple of pounds  then we would be hugely grateful for your support that will allow us to help those most in need.    People can donate directly via this gofundme appeal page  or if you prefer  we can accept donations of non perishable food items directly at the centre Monday to Friday 10am-5pm.    Over the last 12 months your support and wonderful donations have not only helped to sustain our organisation  but it's helped a tremendous amount of families and individuals in their greatest hour of need  and your support really has made a massive impact on their lives.    Our support project  which the foodbank is one stand of  is helping not only people in Garthdee  but 14 other communities in Aberdeen south  while we are helping many organisations to support their clients too. The need is real  the need is genuine  and every penny of your support sustains and supports.    No matter how small your donation may be  whether it's one pound  or one tin of food  it's hugely appreciated and makes a difference and we are hugely grateful  as are those benefitting from your generosity.     Thank you for all of the support during 2020  it's been amazing  and now in 2021 we strive to ensure no one slips through the net with your support.  THANK YOU FROM TEAM INCHGARTH.        ",False

This half term  however  and over this coming Christmas  we truly need your help to feed the new wave of people and pets from across London who are in crisis and will be coming through our doors this winter at Kath's Place  50 Friendly Street  Deptford SE8 4DR.    But this October millions will lose £1040 through the cut to #UniversalCredit people many in low paid work & most already on the breadline not helped by the increasing high cost of rent & rising energy -transport costs .Can you imagine losing up to 20%plus of your monthly income? That is the reality for so many people in the present crisis. Rents are so high in our area that people in work do not have enough cash to pay the rent and  probably for the first time in their lives  are having to trade a visit to their local coffee shop for a visit to the We Care Food Bank and Food Pantry for help  advice  support and solidarity. Embarrased and even ashamed  but even more desperate and distraught that their kids are going hungry  mums tell us that they can go days without food  and  on average  it takes people at least a week of going hungry before they finally come through our doors and ask for help. We really do need your donation this Christmas GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw . Becasue we help everyone and anyone and do not focus on one particular group (such as refugees or the homeless) we get absolutely NO national or local government funding or any other type of funding.

Many individuals and families have suffered additional hardship during this period and demand for foodbank services has increased significantly over this time and continues to rise. The ending of the furlough scheme at the end of October is likely to result in this demand increasing further as more people are unfortunately likely to be made redundant.    The foodbank at Danebury Drive has been run since the start of lockdown by one individual from her own front garden. Initially this was on a small scale helping a number of local families  but has grown significantly to the point where currently 50 food parcels are produced weekly with an addition 75 individuals access the food on offer for collection for themselves and families.    As a result  the foodbank has become a valuable resource for families on the North and East sides of Acomb. This is one of a network of community foodbanks set up across the city who are all working together to share resources best they can.    The onset of winter means that to continue premises need to found as running this outside with no cover will no longer be viable. Premises have been found at a local church with the offer of a peppercorn rent. In addition to rent funding will be required to cover rent and fuel costs    The foodbank currently receives a significant amount of food donations from Co-op  Fareshare and Morrisons amongst others which is mainly of items such as bread and non-perishable items. Whilst the support has been amazing  this rarely provides sufficient fresh items to support the need  hence the additional purchase of such items mentioned above. Clearly such nutritional items are required for an individual to have a balanced diet  made more important by the fact that many children are supported by the bank.    Up to date the £250pw for fresh items has been covered by a weekly £200pw purchase of produce by a local charity (Kitchen for Everyone York) with the additional made up by the small amount of monetary donations received at the foodbank. However  the current level of support from Kitchen for Everyone cannot be maintained and their support has dropped to £100pw due to a shortage of funding. This level of funding will be continued until the end of 2020.    The costs of powering the fridge freezers and fuel for collection has been borne by the individual running the bank  but this cannot be maintained.

It is more important than ever that we work together to support one another. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund has launched to provide support to those most at need in our community. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund Right now many of us are understandably feeling anxious and vulnerable  but there are many among us that need immediate support in order to ensure that they can have access to food. Greenwich residents have a proud history of looking after one another - and never has this been more important than now. So I have been working with Greenwich Food Bank to create the Greenwich Food Bank Fund. As the borough faces one of its most important challenges in living memory  the Fund has been set up to ensure that those in need across the borough have access to the help they need. Please  even during this most difficult of times  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Greenwich. Please be assured that even the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference. Thank you for your generosity. FAQs Where will the funds go? The funds will go directly to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by the Greenwich Food Bank and delivered to food banks across the borough  from Blackheath to Eltham  Kidbrooke  Thamesmead and beyond. A full list of food bank locations is available at https://greenwich.foodbank.org.uk/locations/. If I donate will it go directly to those who need it? Yes  your donation will go directly to Greenwich Food Bank. Unlike some other platforms  GoFundMe does not charge a fundraising fee although it takes a small transaction fee. See https://www.gofundme.com/c/free-fundraising for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to. Will the money be spent in Greenwich? Yes. Is there anything else I can do? The most immediate need is to raise finance  so that purchasing can continue. However there is also a need to: (1) donate food where possible; and (2) create a team of delivery drivers as the Food Bank moves to a delivery model. If you are able to help with either of these  please email [email redacted].uk. Where can I find more information about Covid-19? For general information on CV-19  please visit the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response or the NHS at https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/.

Due to the pandemic  countless numbers of small and local businesses have been forced to close - with barbershops/hair salons being examples of the businesses that are suffering the most. Now  the normal response for the owner of a business like this would be to take advantage of rate relief  seek bridge funding for the business and also look for financial support being offered to people that are self-employed.    But not Ziggy...        Ziggy has converted the Barbershop into a Food Bank that is specifically focused on helping the elderly and other vulnerable members of the local community to have access to the food and sustenance they need in a time when it may be challenging to make trips to supermarkets or go shopping themselves.    We all know that local businesses like barbershops are massive pillars within communities as they are connected to so many people and aware of a range of local issues. So  who better and where better for a Food Bank to support vulnerable people to come from?        As it stands  Ziggy is not only travelling (on his own dime) to his shop  to the homes of people who cannot make it to his Food Bank and even spending his own money to buy food if he is short on donations from local people that are aware his Food Bank Exists. ALL WHILST HE IS LOSING MONEY AS HE CANNOT TRADE AND RUN HIS BUSINESS AS NORMAL.    So  now we need to support this local hero by helping to alleviate the financial pressure that comes from still having to maintain the utility costs at the shop  the transport costs that come with running the Food Bank and also to help access further food to support vulnerable local people.",False

I was born in Nigeria and moved to the UK in 2004 to study. I finished my Masters in 2014 and am currently living in the North West area of Merseyside. I have previously worked for Foodbank as a volunteer during the pandemic helping homeless people  migrants  and other vulnerable people.    Situation?    I have always worked and paid my living expenses when I had a student visa. However  because of the hostile environment policy and UK’s draconian immigration system  I do not have permission to work  and I have no recourse to public funds (NRPF)  meaning that I have no access to housing support and benefits. As a result  I have been couch surfing and relying on the kindness of friends to stop me from being street homeless. I am also struggling with prediabetes and need proper nutrition and diet to avoid my situation getting worse.    What’s the plan?    Because I cannot work due to my dispute with the Home Office  I am kindly asking for some financial support to help with my living needs while I await a decision on my application with the Home Office. Thank you for your generosity and kindness during this difficult phase in my life.",False

Wycombe Food Hub (WFH) came about at the start of lockdown. We collected residual food from leading supermarkets. Our products are often short dated ‘Best Before End’ (BBE) dates. These products are still usable. The range varies on what we source each week from our partners. We are collecting over 200 green crates each week.   We supply products to people unable to access or buy food  those that cannot get Government aid or are unable to survive on the Government’s benefit payments  those who are now suffering from loss of jobs and the self-employed who can’t get benefits  those who cannot access the traditional referral foodbanks.   The range of people coming to us for help is growing weekly. Considering what’s happening nationally the need for our food and services will continue to grow.    We are now collecting from even more supermarkets  allotments and farms    We have now secured a retail shop in the centre of High Wycombe. The shop is open 5 days a week   The shop allows us to distribute not only residual food but also offer chilled and frozen food.     Partner organisations are now working with us to signpost and help those needing more care and referral to statutory authorities.     Moving into a retail premises has now incurred us some long-term financial liabilities and we need to reach out for help   We are fundraising for building  building refurb  building repairs  building insurance  equipment and software  electricity and utilities  print and collateral .     We started with a zero funding stream. We have managed to secure some small grants and donations from friendly benefactors  which has allowed us to deliver to the stage we are now .     We now need to fundraise to be able to grow and continue to deliver services.

and toys directly to families who needed them. I couldn't find anywhere and it occurred to me that whilst we had lots of foodbanks we didn't have any for children's clothes or toys and if you can't afford to put food on the table you cant afford to buy clothes or toys for your child either.    Sebby's Corner  named in honour of my late brother  began only a month ago and yet the demand for our services is increasing daily. We hear stories of families who are choosing whether to eat or heat their homes  parents who go without food so their kids can eat.     We are working with foodbanks and schools across Herts  Barnet  Middlesex and London to reach as many vulnerable families as we can.    We have been so grateful for your donations of preloved clothes and toys. You've inundated us and we can't thank you enough. Now we need your help in a different way. There are lots of items our families desperately need that we need to buy new  such as underwear  nappies  baby milk and toiletries.    We would be so grateful for your help so we don't have to turn anyone away.    Your money will be used to purchase:  - Nappies  - Wipes  - Baby food  - Formula  - Baby soap  - Childrens toothbrushes   - Childrens toothpaste  - Childrens shampoo  - Maternity pads  - Breast pads  - Nappy cream  - Children's underwear  - Storage boxes (to store your donated clothes and toys)    Anything you can contribute will be so appreciated.     Love Bianca and all the Sebby's Corner volunteers x",False

We are an entirely self funded volunteer led group of like minded local people  young and old  who wanted to do something to help the homeless and needy in our neighbourhood. So in November 2018 we founded the Tooting Community Kitchen. Since then we have run a weekly distribution of hot food  and essential supplies. We now have 50 active volunteers and we have been able to assist hundreds of people  so far!    Currently  every Wednesday and Saturday evening our volunteers are able to provide the following help:    • We distribute food packs to a local shelter for homeless people  • We set up a stall from 5.30pm to 6.30pm next to Tooting Broadway Market where we serve hot food  soups  drinks and hand out toiletries and sanitary products  • Clapham Common Venn St 8pm our hot food and drinks stall serves many who are street homeless  in hostels and supported housing.  • Clapham South  6pm- 6.30pm Refugees in nearby hotels  serving hot food  cakes  drinks and fresh fruit.  • we have recently opened our foodbank based at 104 Upper Tooting Rd  SW17 7EN  walk up Price Close. Fridays 9-1pm food donations drop off. Fridays 9-11am open to guests to collect what they need. Our outreach volunteers visit known places where homeless people sleep in the local community and we provide them with a hot meal  a hot drink  toiletries and sanitary products and sleeping bags  • Our outreach teams are now able to serve people in areas of Wandsworth (Clapham Junction  Putney High Street  and Clapham South / Common / and North.      We urgently need donations so this much needed work can carry on in the community.     Please help us to help those in need.      Tooting Community Kitchen",False

As a result of the partnerships which have been made we have been able to supply food parcels for up to 100 families a week at times  this does not account for the number of people who come to collect food items at the church and these are separate to the Foodbank referrals. The contacts for the food parcels have come through various schools  individuals and other groups. We have also arranged the purchase and packing of around 50 fresh fruit and vegetable parcels for the local food bank each week. Since the start of Covid we have produced over 1250 food parcels between the Wokingham Community Hub  the Foodbank and direct contacts.    The majority of the items we have are donated however with the financial donations we receive we are able to put this back into the project and purchase items that we require. Share- Wokingham has been open daily to anyone who can come along to Norreys Church  offering bakery items and any other surplus food stock we have – there is no charge for this but if people are able to make a donation  however small  it is always appreciated. This means it does not carry the stigma attached to going to the Foodbank as people are not just being able to feed themselves for little to no money but they are also having an environmental impact in tackling the waste issue.    As the pandemic has continued the needs of those that we support have changed  initially it was people who were shielding and unable to get out and now we are really seeing the economic impact  job losses and financial woes have meant that people are struggling - that is where we can support.",False

In Pakistan  approximately 53 000 children die consequential to waterborne diseases from consuming contaminated water. Water filtration plants work via a complex technology incorporating chemical  biological  physical processes to eliminate toxins and pollutants infecting water. One filtration plant will cost approx £2000  hence due to financial restraints there is often a struggle to implement them on a wider scale in Pakistan. At this moment  our current funds can only stretch to provide for one water filtration plant  which we are in the process of building. This will be located at a mosque so that those in it’s close proximity may enjoy the basic necessity and gift of water. We aim to attend to those in dire need and inshallah with the help of your donations we intend to increase our production and build two more water filtration plants so more communities may quench their thirst with water that won’t kill them. Our goal will be £4000  to be realistic  so to build two filtration plants that will provide to large and suffering communities. If we exceed this amount we can build more inshallah! This Ramadan  your donation could help gift not only water to an entire community but a sustainable system of access to water. Which would mean that a continual amount of clean water can be supplied to local residents for generations to come.Donations can be made in your name  a loved ones name or as sadaqa jariya for one who is no longer with us. On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him)  who said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Allah SWT will say on the Day of Resurrection:“O son of Adam  I asked you to give Me to drink and you gave Me not to drink. He will say: O Lord  how should I give You to drink when You are the Lord of the worlds? He will say: My servant So-and-so asked you to give him to drink and you gave him not to drink. Had you given him to drink you would have surely found that with Me.” Our brothers and sisters need us...let us fulfil our duties as an ummah.

We are so excited about the prospect of bringing this old Grade II listed building back to life! It was originally built in the early 1900’s as a Temperance Hall  since then it has had a plethora of uses  most recent of which left the building in a semi-derelict condition which included severe fire damage.    However  following its acquisition by The Tab Church  fresh ideas began to surface as to how it might be rescued  restored  and adapted to suit the needs for modern usage as Church  Community and Conferencing facility.    The ‘Tab1Milli’ is what will enable this most significant part of the Big Build project vision to become a reality  and the building actually able to be used.    But we can’t pull this off without your generous support because this is the largest financial project The Tab has ever undertaken.    We are therefore asking you to join with us through radical generosity  as together we step out in faith towards hitting the £1Million target by continually bringing our financial gifts together now and over the coming weeks and months.    Once the entire building is renovated  it will enable The Tab to continue and expand its traditional church functions and community initiatives  which are not limited to but currently include:  · Sunday services  · Kids church for children  · Crèche during the Sunday services  · Weekly prayer meetings  · Christian education and classes  · Administrative offices  · Bookshop/resources  · Food Bank – hosting Lewisham Central’s foodbank and distribution point.

We have also been providing aid to refugees in Camp Moria since 2018 in partnership with Kitrinos Healthcare and Team Humanity who are both charities registered to work in Greece. We have collected  sent (via container) and provided vital humanitarian aid to Refugees in Moria camp including food parcels  baby milk  nappies  clothes  shoes and blankets and documented the distributions on social media (WhatsApp). Team Humanity are our implementing partner on the ground and they have distributed regular food parcels to new arrivals on our behalf. In recent months there has been a dramatic increase in the number of new arrivals and conditions are horrendous. Many families are living in inhumane conditions with little or new food. Since November 2019 SWAN - with the help of TEAM HUMANITY has been providing bread (which is prepared by Refugees) in the camp to starving refugees in and outside Moria Camp. The cost of preparing each bread is 40 cents. €400 provides 1000 breads. There are currently 21 000+ refugees in Moria and many new arrivals have no funds and the queues are so long for the food provided by the Greek authorities and local charities that many get nothing. All funds received for this campaign will be sent to our implementing partner Team Humanity to pay for preparation and distribution of the bread. The ground team send pictures of each distribution to SWAN which we share with donors for transparency. The bread we distribute is often all they will eat. SWAN aim to provide bread three times a week - £1200. If we could do more we would. But we are a small charity dependent on your support.

Can you believe it?    In that time  we have fed more than 2500 families across Reading and the surrounding areas.    It started as a small venture but as the word got out  it became more and more apparent that there was a huge grey area in the community regarding the support of families who have their lives turned on it’s head over night.    Free Meals  Full Hearts is NOT designed to help the same families on a week in  week out basis. I created the group to support those who maybe too proud or embarrassed to reach out for help or go to a food bank. It was created for families who may have faced redundancy or who are struggling on furlough… it’s for those without a support network around them who needs a little short term support.    I have been overwhelmed with the support in the last 12 months. The newspaper articles and TV appearances has helped raise a huge amount of awareness. And I’m overwhelmingly flattered to have received my Pride of Britain AND Pride of Reading nominations- thank you to everyone who has voted!    The success of this group purely comes down to both the physical donation of food but also the financial support provided by this Go Fund Me page. I would not be able to do what I do without this so thank you in anticipation for your support    All the money raised is used within this group and is withdrawn for food  personal hygiene products and pet products. Once purchased  the donation is delivered with confidence to the family           ",False

The Project /Building Purley Masjid​    Purley Masjid is a modern Islamic community centre in a suburb of South London  Purley. It was established in 2015 after fund raising to accommodate the needs of the local Muslim community.    Ma Sha’ Allah  the Masjid is now trying to cope with the demand and has to overcome many challenges to support the Muslim and also non-Muslim community. Here are just a few of examples of the issues:     We have one main hall which accommodates only 200 people for an average Jumu’ah congregation of over 400.      People often have to wait outside in the forecourt for the second Jamaat     Current facilities for ladies accommodates around 30  whereas the demand is known to be in excess of 150. This is severely restricting our ability to meet current demand for women     Our lectures  Fitness Classes  Mother and Toddlers group  daily iftaris in Ramadhan and seniors meet up sessions all take place on the same carpeted area on which we pray. This is not ideal and as we are effectively operating out of one hall  it means that we can only have one activity happening at any given time     The Food Bank only has enough space for a shelf rack to store food. It caters for anyone in need in the Purley community  Muslim and non-Muslim alike        By the Grace of Allah swt we have embarked on the Building Purley Masjid project that will cater for the needs of the community. The project will result in a new Masjid on the current Purley Masjid site and will be a modern  purpose built building for the community spanning 6 floors that will include:     Two male prayer halls with a combined capacity of 500     A ladies prayer hall with capacity of over 200 and crèche facilities      A multi purpose hall     A dedicated lecture/events hall (we held over 100 last year)  which can accommodate 100 people     Improved facilities for our already existing Youth Activities  Mother and Toddlers Group and Seniors Group     Separate classrooms for our Madrasah classes      More space for our weekly Food Bank  ​​    We already have all these activities running at Purley Masjid but are struggling to meet demands and keep up the excellent level of service we provide.",False

My original message: 30th August  2019    This is incredibly difficult for me to write  but I need to ask my friends  acquaintances and perhaps even some people whom I don’t know  to help me get through the next few months.    I am a domestic abusive survivor struggling to meet essential living costs and the situation is going to escalate rapidly because my employer is deducting more than 25% of my pay from September onwards  to recover two overpayments they made in error for a really long time  without me or payroll noticing.    I’m already on a low income and have been trying to find a more stable job. Until now I’ve been working two jobs  but the temporary one is coming to an end and I will only have my permanent part-time job – where they have persistently tried to dismiss me on health grounds so aside from the overpayment recovery  I just can’t hold on there for much longer.    Whenever I do give my notice or get dismissed  they’ll take the entirety of my final month’s pay.    I live alone but the person I used to cohabit with left substantial utility bill debts at our home that I didn’t become aware of until later  since they lied about having cleared balances. There’s not enough space to move another person in  and I can’t move out right now for financial and contractual reasons.    Because of an active police investigation for rape and domestic abuse that I can’t go into  I’ve already borrowed money for unexpected costs like home security  numerous phone calls to charities and agencies offering professional advice  and private therapy which unfortunately I had to quit.    My chronically poor health has dramatically worsened – I’ve been to a&e twice in the past fortnight because of a kidney infection that didn’t respond to treatment and I had to pawn things to pay for my ongoing prescriptions  but there’s not much of value left for me to sell.    I need to wear glasses but have been doing without for several months since they broke; I’m doing without a lot of things. One of my cats needs dental surgery soon but this isn’t going to be possible.    I earn slightly too much to claim benefits or get free prescriptions and despite years of hospital referrals  I am still fighting for a diagnosis to explain my physical health problems so I’m not currently eligible for any support that could be claimed.    Unfortunately I’m estranged from my parents and I don’t have regular contact with any other family.    I don’t have savings and I wouldn’t realistically be able to repay any further money borrowed.    Up to this point I’ve managed to keep on top of the rent and buy cat food but I have now begun going without my own food  even before overpayment recovery has started. I’m hoping to access a food bank next week but the period I can use them for will be limited.    It’s hard to put a figure on how much help I should ask for  since the only real solution is me finding a job where they’re not actively trying to dismiss me for my chronic health problems  but I am hopeful that if I can just get straight with the money I already owe and raise a couple of months’ living expenses to buy myself time whilst finding a better job  then I can make things work.    Thank you for reading this far; I am extremely grateful to anyone who can donate or share this page. I don’t have many followers and would really appreciate people making this fundraiser more visible. ",False

I’m married to john and have 5 beautiful children.   A few years ago john was working as a helicopter pilot. A career he had wanted since he was a child and absolutely adored.    But then he got sick. He struggled for a long time before doctors figured out he had several auto immune diseases all at once. He struggles every day with pain  sickness  and insomnia. He takes morphine every day and has done for years  with really debilitating side effects because the medical system can’t help him.   He was made redundant from his beloved job and eventually we lost our house to the bank as we couldn’t keep up with the mortgage. This is something he really struggles to accept. Since then we have gone from one disaster to another. We rent a house at the moment that the landlord wants us to move out so they can use it for something else but we have nowhere to go. The council can’t help us. No private landlord will help because john is not working and we cannot afford to get anywhere ourselves.     It’s really hard to watch our kids miss out on so much in their childhood. Some of them are too young to remember the amazing  fun  hardworking dad they had. Now they see him sick and weak and they see all the things they miss out on because we cannot afford it or because he is too ill to take part in it. It’s hard to hide our tears when we know there’s something they want but we can’t give it to them. Or hide our upset when we have to go to the food bank or sell some of our things to give them a birthday present or afford their homeschooling needs.   It’s very humbling to have to hold your hands up and admit you need help. For john to not be able to provide for his family is devastating. He is not able to admit we need help but I as a wife and mother know that humbling ourselves and asking for help is the only option left open to us.     Johns own doctors have told us about medication they believe will really help him and get him off the morphine. But they cannot prescribe this medication on the NHS and unfortunately we cannot afford to buy it privately. John was due to have an operation in January 2020 but it was postponed due to COViD and he is still waiting. He could get this operation in a matter of weeks privately but we cannot afford to pay for it. There are many things we could do to help him get better and get back to work but we cannot afford it. It’s extremely heartbreaking to know there is help right in front of us but we cannot take advantage of it because we don’t have enough money.     We have experienced people’s kindness throughout this process. We feel so ashamed that we have not been able to repay that kindness and to have to ask for more help but that’s exactly what I’m doing. I need my husband back. My kids need their father back and we need some stability in our lives again  we need a forever home.   If you could please help in anyway I would be so so grateful. You have no idea how much your help could change our lives. Please help me get my husband well again and not suffer so much everyday. Please me give my babies a forever home and a dad who is well enough to be the dad he always wanted to be.     Thank you for any help you can give and We would be so grateful for any prayers you could offer for our family. Xx    Edit:  Thank you all so much for your donations. It’s incredibly overwhelming to experience all your generosity and kindness. And thank you also to the people who have personally sent donations directly to us  Mavis & Chris and Marion O’Reilly.   We are totally humbled by your love and kindness. Thank you all xxxx",False

The ARK which comes under the umbrella of The Congregation of Yahweh  a registered charity (number 245132)  would like to take this opportunity to ask you for your kind assistance. If you’re in a position to financially support our Food Bank at The Ark  it would be greatly appreciated. We will use your donation to help those who require help and/or support.     At The ARK  we are committed to providing free wholesome home-cooked food for a cross range of families  the elderly  the vulnerable  students  and single people regardless of gender  ethnicity  and age. We also provide a food parcel for school children during the holidays and when it is needed.    The aim of raising funds is also to enable us to provide community-based projects to enable the elderly to engage together meeting their needs for social & personal interaction  in turn hoping to stem the gap of social isolation. We would like to purchase a delivery van to help our volunteers to be able to collect and deliver food donations and parcels.    At the beginning of this current pandemic  we saw the need to provide food  toiletries  and home essential parcels to assist all those who were on furlough and/or were struggling financially. We have delivered meal service to people currently on our books & those that are referred to us from external sources. All food donated are most definitely put to good use in our food parcels  which is a much-needed service and one we are hoping to continue long after the disappearance of the pandemic.    Our main focus is reaching into the community and meeting their current needs and offering hope. Since April 2020 we have delivered over 500 individual food parcels to a wide range of people and organizations within Nottingham. This coming year we would like to build on what we have achieved during last year in reaching our community not with just food parcels but with more practical help in their home and their lives.

Your donations will go towards our Brent community food bank for the homeless  those in need for whatever reason  and the elderly in the community especially during the pandemic. Members from our community attend every Wednesday between 6.30-7.30pm at The Lewinson Centre 165-167 High Road Willesden NW10 (opposite Savers) and benefit from getting  free of charge  a whole range of food  and other items like toiletries and clothes if available. How We Began On the 1st April 2020 the Agape Ministry Food Bank was birthed we were responding to the obviously need in our Community in Brent caused by this dreadful Coronavirus pandemic. There were three volunteer workers: Amie Alexis  Sis Madge Facey and myself  Felicia Alexis. We had one box  which was by no means full  and a desire to minister to the church and the community. That day we distributed 9 bags.   In the weeks that followed we have seen God move in an amazing way. Members and friends of the Church rose to the challenge  they donated money on-line and donated food items to the Ministry over and over again. I have to pause here to say ‘thank you’ for your generosity. Heaven knows how many people you have impacted in a positive way. I would like to acknowledge not only those who have given  but to those who have prayed or volunteered their time in anyway as well. We are workers together with God and we are all doing our bit.   Some people will bring in one or two items some  several bags full. Nothing is too small or too big  all is received gratefully. From time to time we will receive surprise donations from the local butchers  restaurants  green grocers and even a school. Now we are into a new year still facing the pandemic and we are ministering to more and more people in the community. We see people every week from all different nationalities. Besides offering food we provide a safe place where people can come and feel the presence of God and find hope in a hopeless world. No one is rejected  everyone is accepted. Every week we provide tea  coffee  biscuits and cake for those coming in. Besides food  people are now looking for nappies  washing powder  readymade meals and even a vacuum cleaner. Our Faithful Volunteers I would like to mention the faithful volunteers that work with  me week after week. Sis Madge Facey  Sis Janet Ashman  Sis Fay Scott and my faithful husband Joseph Alexis. Bro Anthony Manning who sets a worshipful atmosphere with live music and Bro David Oram who comes every other week with his Healing banner and offers prayers for anyone who asks. I also would like to mention Bro Tim Stewart  who gets roped into helping me anytime he turns up and Sis Denice Denton who is there whenever she can be. We also have a young lady who lives in the community who has recently volunteered some of her time  to helping us with the ministry.   As we begin 2021 we will be inviting business people to partner with us by donating £100.00 for one month. In return the team will pray faithfully for the success of that business for the whole of that month and we will promote it. Joseph Alexis is the first ‘volunteer’ and his business is called Sixela Ltd  he provides a handyman services. He can be contacted on Telephone No. 07857 345793.   The Agape Ministry is growing and we are expecting to see increase this year both in numbers and in our sphere of influence. May God bless you all as we use every opportunity that we have to let our light shine before men that they may see our good works and come to glorify our Father who is in heaven.

50","Raising money for frontline nhs staff for food  accommodation and whatever else needed  and putting back into the community for food banks for families unable to work So lockdown is now upon us all so I thought of a way of raising money for nhs frontline staff and foodbanks for families unable to work  And a way to keep people smiling  So..... nominate a friend to shave there hair ( it’ll grow back by the time we’re out of this sh#t ) They name there price  Check the link to see if they’ve donated And shave it !!!!! Please copy and share and let’s see how much we can raise for this much needed cause and have a barrel of laughs along the way. Before and after pics will make it so much funnier ",False

times of the year for lots of people. Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland.

I have been keeping these two jerseys to one day get framed and put them up on my wall. They mean a lot to me as anyone who knows football will know the magnitude of “that” game. During lockdown I made a decision to put them to a good cause and raise money for people who really need it most. I will always have the memories and with help from everyone we can hopefully raise a nice amount. Please donate or purchase a ticket. We can all play a little part so all donations are welcome but to enter its £15 for one ticket. No limit on tickets purchased.     Stay safe and healthy    Thank you    Billy xxx",False

The individual /individuals have taken tablets that were used for referrals to the fuel bank to enable those in crisis to receive an emergency payment and for a nationwide surveys into foodbank from Edinburgh university. They have taken our main hard drive /pc all are password protected . They have obviously ransacked the office and damaged our filing cabinets. Along side the items we need to replace   they have taken around £200 that was donated over the Christmas period which obviously provides much needed funds for the day to day running of the foodbank. Food was taken too  so we are putting an appeal out for tinned fish  rice pudding  tinned fish   tinned tomatoes and uht milk.   We as a charity can little afford the extra costs incurred to replace the more valuable items and office furniture. Any donations will be greatly received and used to help to wider community .      As stated our original target was £1000 and we have blown away by the generosity of the wider public. I am one of the merry band of volunteers at Oldham Foodbank. We offer assistance to those in crisis with food parcels for 3 days . As we have smashed our target   extra money raised will be used to enhance our current security systems to prevent ourselves from being targeted again . Furthermore the money raised will secure day to day expenses of the Foodbank for the foreseeable future   enabling us to continue to provide to those in need and crisis.   All monies raised is to be transferred to Oldham Foodbank bank account which is run by our Trustees.

Our family were in awe by his altruistic desire to give  feed and aid ALL  despite race/ethnicity/religion among him even whilst suffering himself.     Since opening  our family alone have vetted 25 families with monthly food rations from December 2019- present. Unfortunately  25 families do not cover the innumerable amount of people starving  for whom we want to share some light  hope and nurture to amidst dark times  that is their indefinite reality.    Our foodbank prioritises poor families with children  single mothers/widowers and those who themselves or their children suffer with debilitating mental/physical health issues trying to make ends meet to provide for their children- this is done with rigorous checks by our team to ensure nobody exploits such a service. The families are issued with a monthly ration card valid for 12 months which provides them with stock for each month as per the individual needs of the family. These include: 10kg chapati flour (atta)  5kg sugar  5kg various lentils/daal  5kg rice  5L cooking oil  tea leaves  salt  spices and other necessary food items. £25 will feed a family of 5 for the month however any donation  no matter how big or small will impact them greatly.     100% of the donationsgo to those in need  with our incredible staff being voluntary workers (so no wages or salaries are deducted from donations) and our facilities funded with the finances that the late Safdar Hussain Shah left behind for us to carry this out in his legacy- we are relying on your kind donations which will solely provide stock for the families.     During the current COVID-19 crisis  we are aiming to try and provide emergency food supplies to all those suffering in the locale  with the most vulnerable holding priority  we are giving out thousands of food rations but are broken to see that we are unable to extend our help to everyone that needs it- as a small start-up charity  we are grateful for all the support and donations we receive in order to help us reach as many individuals suffering from the crisis as possible.     Unfortunately  we can't do this alone  with the power of unity together we can help fill the stomachs of the poor  not only with food but also the fulfilment of life and hope they may gradually receive from your donations. Our brothers and sisters around the globe need us  we are united by our efforts.   Any donation  no matter how big or small will be greatly appreciated especially in the blessed month of Ramadan  whereby charity is considered its greatest.     We are not the givers  we are just Allah SWT  the Almighty's  servants and can only give what he allows and wishes to be given. The families we aim to feed is by the grace of Allah SWT and it is he who provides to all.     May Allah SWT accept this from you and me  may we fulfil our duty by helping those in need  for which it is their right upon you and I.    “A man’s true wealth is the good he does in this world.” Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W)    Instagram: sadaqajariya.foodbank for further updates",False

The fall off in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that we have had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased our costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries. All donations will go directly to purchasing items for food parcels.

We value all our supporters who make a big difference. We provide three days’ emergency food and support to local families and people in crisis.     Covid19 is impacting Rhondda Foodbank in the following ways:    1. Increased demand across the Rhondda with prospects of getting worse.    2. Reduction in food donations because of the change in shopping habits.    3. Self-isolation of some of our regular volunteers.

A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems. Barrow Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. There has never been a more crucial time to help those who are less fortunate than us - which is why I have organised this event.     The Covid-19 effect   Well before Covid-19 hit the UK  food banks in the Trussell Trust network had been seeing year-on-year increases in levels of need  with 1.9 million emergency food parcels given out in 2019/20. As Covid-19 hit the UK  the Trussell Trust saw an immediate and sustained surge in need across its food banks. In April there was an 89% increase in the number of emergency food parcels given out compared with the same month in 2019. This included a 107% increase in the number of parcels given to children  compared to the same period last year. New findings show that almost 100 000 households received support from a food bank in the Trussell Trust network for the very first time between April and June 2020. It's no secret that the pandemic has had a significant impact on people's jobs and finances - increasing the use of foodbanks nationwide.     What are we doing?   Since March 2020  many people (including myself) have adopted a new hobby in running. Whether it is to pass time  get out of the house  keep fit whilst the gyms are closed or a tool to manage your mental health. Everyone has their individual reasons for running and it would be fantastic to use this as an opportunity to help and support our local foodbank through completing a half marathon challenge (13.1 miles or 21.09 kilometres).     When?  Those who are taking part will complete the run on either Friday 23rd April  Saturday 24th April or Sunday 25th April - uploading their run to the page when complete.     Donations  There is a group target amount of £1 000 and every penny donated is hugely appreciated. However  I am conscious of the financial difficulties that many people face due to the current situation  therefore  it is absolutely fine if you are unable to donate - you can always share this page instead!

Being part of a coastal economy is always difficult over the winter months  but the impact of COVID-19 is potentially catastrophic. Every time we ask a family to self-isolate with COVID symptoms  we’re essentially asking them to spend 14 days in a cold flat with no food. Very few of our families have a support network to rely on  because they are fleeing gang  drug or domestic violence in other parts of the UK; this means that most left their extended support network behind in Birmingham  Liverpool or Glasgow  in order to live in a place with no available infrastructure to deal with the escalating child poverty that’s been growing since the 1980s. All of our families live no more than 2 days ahead as far as food is concerned; they can’t afford to bulk shop and they don’t have a fridge or freezer to fill with supplies. Many of the young women we work with receive their feminine hygiene products from us as a school via the “Red Box” programme. Without that support  they have NO ACCESS to female hygiene products. Any period of time away from a free school meal means no access to food at the best of times; a second national or local lockdown will be catastrophic. Last time the country locked down (in March/April) we had parents ringing us in tears because they had no income  no food and (very frequently) no electricity to power the laptops that the government provided for remote learning. If this surprises you  it probably shouldn’t  because there are very many schools like ours. However  in this particular case you CAN help if you choose to. Please consider donating to our food bank; no donation is too small. We started with a small bunch of shopping bags  intending to provide a “Lockdown Survival Box” to every family we have to ask to self-isolate. Things have escalated since then  so we’re trying to run a full-on  in-house food bank from our school over the winter. We are THE BURTON ACADEMY (www.burtonacademy.org.uk) and our families need your donations  reshares and general goodwill. We’ll pick it up and run with it from there  yes? X ",False

We are understandably gutted. Not only is Canned Laughter incredibly fun but all proceeds from ticket sales go directly to the local food bank in the area the gig is put on in and right now food banks need our support more than ever: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-51837892    All ticket holders will be offered refunds. But ideally we would still like to raise the money we would have made in ticket sales from these two gigs to help the two food banks they would have supported.    We have set our target amount roughly at 80% of all available tickets sold to both events which would have been £2 560. We will split any money raised from this drive between Eat or Heat  The Waltham Forest Food Bank (Canned Laughter - April 25th) and Euston Food Bank (Canned Laughter: Karaoke Roulette - April 4th)    We thank you so much for your support.

Last November as Manchester entered lockdown restrictions local foodbanks came under increasing pressure and seen a huge increase in the need of food support. At the time I decided to embark on a wee running challenge to help raise some much needed funds for the Manchester South Central Foodbank.   One year on and food banks are again gearing up for another surge in demand as the most vulnerable people are plunged into further poverty due to the end of the furlough scheme  steep rises in energy bills and the recent cuts to Universal Credit.  Last year we raised over £7000 running 10km a day for 30 days straight..  This year I’m gonna up the ante and ‘attempt’ to run 15km everyday in November.  Thats 105km a week..   450km over the month..   That’s an extra 35km a week and 150km across the month compared to last year!   If we can raise even a fraction of the money we did last year it will be more than worth it!! Any funds raised will help massively towards the pressures over the Christmas period and will help those most in need.  All donations no matter how small will be deeply appreciated and will go a long way.  Also  any runners out there hit me up! I’ll need some support & encouragement to stay on track!  And we’re off.. ‍♂️",False

That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks  supported by The Trussell Trust  working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.    ABOUT OUR FOODBANK  An introduction to the Morecambe Bay Foodbank project.  Morecambe Bay Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. It began life at the GYM Church on Green Street in Morecambe and has now moved to The West End Community Centre on Westminster Road in Morecambe. We receive and distribute over six tonnes of food each month and our operation has been growing since its inception in 2012.     We have a small staff team led by our Foodbank Manager  Annette Smith  and over eighty regular volunteers who give up their time to help us each week.    ABOUT  HOW FOODBANKS WORK  Providing emergency food to people in crisis.  Every day people in the UK go hungry for reasons ranging from redundancy to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems.    FOOD IS DONATED  Schools  churches  businesses and individuals donate non-perishable  in-date food to a foodbank. Large collections often take place as part of Harvest Festival celebrations and food is also collected at supermarkets.    FOOD IS SORTED AND STORED  Volunteers sort food to check that it’s in date and pack it into boxes ready to be given to people in need. Over 40 000 people give up their time to volunteer at foodbanks.    PROFESSIONALS IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN NEED  Foodbanks partner with a wide range of care professionals such as doctors  health visitors  social workers and police to identify people in crisis and issue them with a foodbank voucher.    CLIENTS RECEIVE FOOD  Foodbank clients bring their voucher to a foodbank centre where it can be redeemed for three days’ emergency food. Volunteers meet clients over a warm drink or free hot meal and are able to signpost people to agencies able to solve the longer-term problem.",False

Thank you again for supporting it & here's to having a little Christmas joy whilst supporting our community.** (20th November)           To celebrate turning 14 years old  Bounce Theatre is proud to have created a very special Christmas Show.    Dear Children is a touring show across Earlsfield & the surrounding areas. Santa is on a secret mission to make sure children know he can still get to all the houses in one night  despite the events of 2020. Along with his head Elf he is on a mission to spread joy this Christmas.     Each show will be socially distanced but joyfully performed outside front doors and in gardens ( whatever the weather!)    Instead of tickets  we are asking for a £10 donation to Earlsfield Foodbank. As we want to help ensure no one in our community is without over winter.     We would love your support.    *PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE REQUESTED A TIME SLOT FROM LOUISE AT BOUNCE THEATRE BEFORE DONATING. OTHERWISE WE CANNOT GUARANTEE WE CAN VISIT*    Merry Christmas!",False

I’m raising money for my local food bank  ‘Eat or Heat’ who run an invaluable service for our community’s most vulnerable residents. They also host community events to bring people together. I don’t want to be political but austerity has affected many of us and around 4 million children now live in poverty. Universal Credit is being rolled out in Waltham Forest this year leading to an inevitable rise in food bank use.Please donate so that the food bank can buy items that aren’t donated regularly - especially sanitary items as well as extending shelf space.Also  if you donate you can set me a challenge and I’ll try do it - please be nice! Thank you so much. If you want to keep in touch follow me on Twitter @CorbynistaTeen.",False

Every year  Droitwich Spa High School and Sixth Form puts on a school-wide Charities Week in order to raise money for a local charity.    However  this year has been different for everybody  and as a result we’ve decided to showcase our events virtually  for free. This allows all students  parents and members of the local community to access the content for some light-hearted entertainment during a difficult time for us all.    The time and effort put in to film and edit these events  both from students and members of staff  has been incredible  and we hope that their effort will be rewarded by your enjoyment and positive feedback  and by being able to raise money for an excellent cause.    All money raised will go directly to the Droitwich Spa Foodbank  who work hard to feed the most vulnerable members of our community. All donations  regardless of size  are hugely appreciated  and could have a larger impact on those who are less fortunate than us. For parents of students  there is also a donation option on the school’s ParentPay system  if you would prefer to make a donation this way.     Below are links to the school’s social media sites  where all filmed content will be posted during Charities Week. https://m.facebook.com/droitwichspahighschool/?locale2=en_GBhttps://www.instagram.com/dshsinsta/?hl=en    Thank you again for your support.

Currently  there is a huge need to help support the food banks  as so many people are needing additional help  to put food on the table  which is where the idea came from.    Many people leading up to the bank holiday would be planning where they are going to stay overnight camping or in their vans or on holiday  sadly for the VE-Day weekend that can no longer happen. So why dont we celebrate at home ?    So the idea is simple plan your trip based at home  prepare everything you need to go camping  stay overnight on the drive in your van  a tent in your garden  or even in your house (but it must be set up like a camping trip)  or in your caravan.     So how do we raise funds ?   Donate a minimum of £5 in the pot or the amount you would normally have paid for a night camping at your favourite spot during the bank holiday weekend.  If local to Nailsea  the money will go to food bank in Nailsea  if not to the national food bank network  every £ will make a difference.    Its not just about fundraising  so let's have some fun  go to town decorating your place of accommodation  take pictures  upload them to the Facebook page  use your imagination to have an amazing night or more 'away at home!'",False

As one of the three Councillors for Western Ward I've found myself often beating my head against a wall to get funds released  so I've decided to take matters into my own hands for a third time.    The target this time is £3000. So  to raise money for them  I've set myself a challenge:    An imperial century (100mi / 160km) on my bike. That I built myself. In one day.     Why am I doing this? Well  last April I caught coronavirus. This absolutely knocked hell out of my fitness and left me barely able to cycle a few kilometres at a time. Since then though I've made a (nearly) full recovery and I want to push myself. This seems like a good challenge to me. I hope you agree!    This is the route.

The knock on effect of lockdowns will see many struggling to earn enough to cover basic needs. While also being stuck at home through winter  sometimes it's a choice between eating or heating.    Access to food banks can be a lifeline to people when they most need it.    While we at Brixton Music Community celebrate the possibility of nightlife returning soon  we also see the chance to go out and dance to music as a privilege that people shouldn't take for granted.    So for the last leg of lockdown  on 12/03/21 from 12pm we are broadcasting a 24 hour music marathon from Larry Sun to keep people staying in doing the right thing  while hopefully raising some money to get mouths fed and bellies full.

We never imagined that six months on we would still be working on the foodbank  the need has not gone away - if anything it’s needed now more than ever. ⠀ The food bank team are now launching a new charity to carry on this important work  as well as aiming to deliver some other exciting new projects. The new group is called ‘Broxtowe Community Projects’ and we are currently fundraising to secure our own premises and continue funding the much needed food parcels. Today we had some really exciting news about a premises and now launching the charity has become a reality. ⠀ We are asking people to contribute to the running costs of this charity in order to keep our shelves stocked and to help us invest in important community projects which will improve the lives and opportunities for the people of Broxtowe. We are fortunate to have secured a premises rent free  but the need for food is increasing so funds are needed now more than ever. The £10000 we are hoping to raise will keep our shelves well stocked for the next six months and allow us to invest in a range of training for our volunteers  introduce more grants and support schemes for our service users and maybe even secure a van to enable our service to travel. We are fairly unique amongst food banks in that we do not limit the number of food parcels someone can access in a year  we accept self referrals and also offer fresh food that includes fruit and vegetables  cheese  milk and a range of frozen foods in addition to the usual ambient packets. We also try and offer our service users a degree of choice to ensure a sense of dignity and we provide advice  guidance and onward referrals where needed. Please if you can  give generously so we can continue to do this important work. Thank you  Broxtowe Community Projects Team. ",False

The outreaching towns and villages have become cut off due to the ongoing threat of further tremors. Food and water have become very expensive and unaffordable by the poor.  Volunteers from Our school near Darjeeling have started a food bank to help feed the desolate.  Since Saturday 25/04/2015 they have served nearly 500 people with food and drink and provided a safe outdoor location to rest.  We need help and support to continue this work and also send some to Mirik  where a 5.2 shock hit on 27/04/15.      Over the last three years we have been supporting under privileged children with a start in education. Our teachers and volunteers in the region have worked tirelessly to help these children to better their lives. Sadly now they are called in to help the relieve effort in this isolated region and we will support their every effort to the maximum. With your help and support we can make a direct impact in those areas that may not see any other relief for a long time yet.
