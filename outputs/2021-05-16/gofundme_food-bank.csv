I have thought carefully before doing this  tried hard to avoid it and have tried to fund the legal fees myself. Now the time has come when I finally have to reach out to my friends and speak up. Behind closed doors the last 8 years of my life have been traumatic to say the least. In 2013 I divorced my ex husband for personal reasons which left me bringing up my 18 month old baby girl and 6 year old daughter myself. I was lucky and blessed enough to have my mum and dad who helped support us. They were our rock who we saw most days. But then in 2016  my mum suffered a fatal stroke which sadly brought a sudden end to her life. Me and my girls were shattered. My dad in his grief continued to help support us after this time offering much love and care. He helped with my children so that I could continue my studies. In 2017  I met someone who I thought was finally going to be there for me and my girls  we even had a baby together but during the pregnancy he became a different person  and whilst pregnant I became a frightened  isolated victim of domestic abuse. A few months after having the baby I had to quickly seek help from Womens Aid who assessed me and advised me that I had been victim of domestic violence. They helped to keep me and my 3 daughters safe when I left the relationship. During my pregnancy my dad had become ill and was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer. He then too passed away in December 2019 leaving us all alone to fight back against my abuser. The domestic abuse has had a huge impact on our lives. I struggle with anxiety as a result of the abuse which makes daily life hard. My confidence and self esteem has been shattered  and my anxiety has been made worse from continued financial abuse and control. During the COVID pandemic  I worked as an Allied Health Care Professional trying to move forward with my life and career. I worked alongside our amazing nurses who inspired me to become a nurse. In January 2021 I enthusiastically started a nursing degree full time  but within 3 days of starting my course  I had court papers sent to me from my ex abuser. I was informed that I was being taken to court and had 5 days to prepare. I was informed that he was going to try take my 2 year old daughter from me who I had tried to protect from him and who I had looked after since the day she was born. The fear was back and coercive control had began again.   I was told I could not have legal aid as I own my own home and would be expected to sell my family home where we have lived and settled the last 3 years. I cannot sell my childrens safe place  it is their stability. Even if I did  I would not sell in time to pay for the court case it is completely unrealistic. I had to find £500 in 5 days to find legal representation. I then had to find thousands of pounds more for the second hearing in March and thousands more for a third hearing in April this year.  My NHS bursary is minimal and barely pays enough money to live never mind legal fees on top. I am getting into debt trying to cope with feeding us  clothing us   paying bills and legal debt  this is all due to being forced into a court case and paying extortionate legal fees alone. I am frightened of what will happen to us financially. Sadly there have been times where I have had to make use of food banks  sell my family car and replace it with a run around to get my children to school and am struggling greatly to make ends meet. I will have to find at least another £4000 to continue safeguarding my toddler and myself and ensure we have legal representation which is vital. I have to find £1570 asap to pay what I owe to ensure my lawyer will continue to represent me. There is another hearing at the end of June where I have to pay £850 the first day  and a further £550 per day for the remaining 2 days as well as pay for the preparation work. We are hoping this will be the last hearing so that me and my girls can peacefully and safely move forward in our lives. I'm trying to keep going every day  be a good mum and work hard to become a nurse. I don't want to be bullied into quitting by somone who seeks to ruin and negatively change the course of our lives. Any money donated will help ensure I can pay the legal bills  see the court process through  keep me and my girls safe and ensure a more positive  brighter future with no more fear when this process is over. If there is any money left over I am happy for it to be donated to Womens Aid and the refuges they provide for families particularly children. Thank you so much to those of you who will help. Asking for financial help is very hard for me  I do not want to ask for help in this way. I have always tried to deal with finance myself  but the extortionate legal fees are giving me little choice. You are helping to keep my toddler safe from harm  and ensure that the court process can be completed to ensure a safe decision is made. Thanks again  Sarah xxxx ",True

Beginning in March 2020  we have delivered 600 meals a week  every week  free of charge to the most in need in South Birmingham. Through great effort  including invaluable help from many volunteers  we have racked up an impressive thirty thousand meals delivered since the first Lockdown one year ago.     We currently operate out of a single kitchen at the Jericho Building in Balsall Heath  and primarily service the wards of Hall Green  Moseley  Kings Heath  Ladywood  Basall Heath  Hockley  Sparkbrook  & Sparkhill. In these areas  we serve a great number of low-income families from diverse ethnic backgrounds  elderly residents  and vulnerable communities  some of whom belong to the homeless community.    We are about to run out of generous funding that we have so far relied on to do this important work  just at a time when we are seeing an increase in need for our services due to the economic impacts of the pandemic. We have seen that across the city  the need for food banks has doubled.    If we are to carry on this much-needed work  then we need your help in the form of any donations you can spare to help the staff and volunteers of ChangeKitchen achieve our goals over the next six months.        Our Running Cost:  So far we have maintained our level of service through grants from the Social Enterprise Support Fund (SESF) [via The National Lottery Community Fund]  and through working hand-in-hand with other charities and social enterprises within movements such as #BrumTogether  initially with the support of Birmingham City Council.     Unfortunately  this grant support is coming to an end in March  and the next round of funding is not available until July. It is therefore imperative that we find the extra donations to carry on this vital work and upgrade our infrastructure to meet the demands of the coming financial year.    It currently costs us about £4000 a month to run our social enterprise. This money goes towards wages  rent  insurance  van hire  and food to top-up the surplus  amongst other expenses.    We estimate the total cost will rise to £5000 in the coming months  in line with meeting increased future demand.    Also  our kitchen is in need of repair and refitting  since 2 out of 3 of our ovens have failed  and we are in the process of procuring a dishwasher given our increasing output.    Where we get our food donations from:  •Waitrose via FareShare Go  •Incredible Surplus (formerly TRJFP Brum) Winson Green Sharehouse  •Our partners in the #BrumTogether network   •Other food via FareShare  more recently via Coop NISA / Ruprai in Kings Heath          What We Need:    We need financial support to do the following over the next six months:    Provide a further 400 meals per week  bringing us up to 1000 meals a week.    Replace our 2 failed ovens with 1 modern  professional fan oven  so that we can increase our food output.    Upgrade our kitchen backend with some new pots  pans  and utensils to keep up with our increased workload.    What we need from you / other opportunities to help:  Although this is a fundraiser  there are other ways in which you can help us. From donating your time volunteering  to sharing our appeal for help via social media and word of mouth.    Monetary donations:    We are hoping with donations from the general public and private enterprise to raise enough to cover our general running costs and upgrade our kitchen. Any help you can give will be greatly appreciated by ourselves and the greater community we serve.    The Social Supper Club:    The Social Supper Club is ChangeKitchen’s latest offering  creating innovative mealboxes to pick up and heat & enjoy at home. This helps us (and you!) to do even more good because for every £20 spent  ChangeKitchen CIC will provide £5 of nutritious homemade meals back into the local community.    Volunteering:    We are always looking for interested volunteers to help towards the work of prepping  cooking  and cleaning at our busy Jericho Kitchen in Balsall Heath. Please get in touch at [email redacted] for more information.     Social media    Please share this page amongst your friends and any local Facebook groups to help our fundraiser get seen by as many people as possible. ",True

The knock on effect of lockdowns will see many struggling to earn enough to cover basic needs. While also being stuck at home through winter  sometimes it's a choice between eating or heating.    Access to food banks can be a lifeline to people when they most need it.    While we at Brixton Music Community celebrate the possibility of nightlife returning soon  we also see the chance to go out and dance to music as a privilege that people shouldn't take for granted.

Why are we doing this? Well we our selves struggled & had to go to food banks.   We were so grateful for the amazing people and volunteers giving time and produce to food banks but saw they struggled being able to provide fresh veggies  herbs & fruit. We want to give back and thought we could fill the gap for fresh healthy produce to the community for free. So that is what our project is - a fresh food bank! We have time  hard work ethic & passion for gardening & helping those in need but we lack funds for seeds  wood and gardening equipment. We need your help!      The following list is the items we need that will help us greatly with our project:     Vegetable seeds (carrots  beetroot  cauliflower etc)   Herb seeds   Lemon  orange  pear trees  Organic compost   A polytunnel greenhouse for the delicate produce   Cedar wood for building raised beds  Nails & building equipment   A hose   Landscape fabric   Chicken wire       The list is always growing but these are our priority.

Our love and sympathies are with Dawn's family and friends during this time  and we feel blessed and grateful to have had her in our lives. We will not forget the presence  impact  and energy she brought to life. Her love of life was always on show  and her beautiful laugh will be impossible to forget. That contagious laugh lit up every room she entered; we will miss it so very much.    Dawn's generosity and warmth were in everything she did. She gave so much of herself to support people  and nothing was ever too much for Dawn; if you ever came to Dawn with a problem or crisis  her first question was always  ""well  what are we going to do about it then?"" Dawn was a Nurse at the local hospital  a UNISON Branch Secretary and Rep. Elected as a Town and Borough Councillor in 2019 for Atherstone Central; Dawn willingly sacrificed what little personal time she had to help other people  causes and projects.    Dawn was a talented organiser and started and delivered countless collections  campaigns  and groups to give support to those in need. From supporting local foodbanks or co-ordinating food-parcels  helping set up and run Atherstone Matters and Bee There For Me  to numerous Facebook communities. She was passionate about others' wellbeing. So many tributes have credited Dawn to helping them through a difficult time in their lives. The immeasurable love and compassion she offered didn't discriminate. Whoever you were – you knew you could count on Dawn.     In memory of how Dawn lived her life to help others  we wish to raise money for causes Dawn cared about. We know there were many causes that Dawn cared about deeply and would want to support. To try and choose just one or even two causes to support in memory of Dawn would be challenging. Therefore  in discussion with the family  it has been decided to create a donation pool and split the donations between different causes. This will be just a drop in the ocean compared to Dawn's impact on all our lives  but we hope that we can honour Dawn's legacy in some small way.    Suggestions so far have been:      - UNISON relief fund.    - Local food banks.    - Domestic Abuse support.    - Period Poverty support.      Thank you for your time and your support.    ",True

I'm Jake  26  based in Somerset  South West UK!   I'm a passionate learning blacksmith/woodworker and have spent the past 10 years since age 16 - Stuck in a cycle of homelessness and adversity which has left me with no family  and just a small handful of friends left!   I have tried numerous times to engage and access support/help through the UK government  and related councils etc.. Though now I'm 26  male and have no local connection the most help I seem to be able to access to help my situation is food banks and a hostel for one night a week!   I have never been so enthusiastic about anything in my life quite like I am with blacksmithing  there's just so much to learn and achieve!   Currently I'm staying in the back of my first ever van a broken Peugeot expert (2000 it was built)  which has no locks  no electricity a broken gearbox/clutch and most of the internals were gutted by previous owners.           All I need to be able to survive  and continue developing and progressing as a blacksmith is a large enough van to sustainably live inside  the essentials such as water/power/warmth for cooking/cleaning/maintaining good physical/mental health  storage for my few possessions and the means to run off grid a few usb chargers  lights and perhaps a couple power tools from time to time.   I intend on using the funds to buy a second hand van  that is ideally taxed/motd and roadworthy that I can then convert into a mobile home  with a wood burner installed  solar/wind generators to charge batteries and also a converter to allow me to run 240v appliances from time to time.   The space to live/design and wash/cook/clean within and of course a fold out workshop attached to the side of the van so I can daily practice and progress with blacksmithing /woodworking and artisan related crafts.   I wish to also use the funds to put me through driving lessons and also insure myself on the van so I can travel and develop without affecting anyones peace and quiet!   I know it seems like alot to ask  however I don't expect anyone to help me buy a home  or transport me and a caravan constantly!   I have been mostly homeless/sofa surfing and trying to make ends meet for ten years now  and I am determined to finally end this horrible cycle and become independent and self sustainable!   I just need the help of many others in order to do so!   I've got no savings/no credit/no family and nothing to sell to be able to afford this salvation  and as it stands I've got at most a few more weeks until I'm expected to vacate the land I'm currently stuck on with my broken and very poorly old van.   I wouldn't ever be able to thank those who donate enough  and if more than my goal is raised then I wish to donate whatever isn't used in the purchase/conversion of the van I hope to get and live in  towards the Blacksmith who shaped my passion and commitment to learning this craft  and also towards local charities and organisations that I believe do more to help the local community than the government services that claim to serve them!   I also wish to eventually get a petition going to hopefully spur about change with the government and their lack of support to all aged above 25 and also those who wish to pursue any kind of creative arts!   I can promise however with this van I hope to get  and after turning her into a sustainable off grid home/workshop to never stop becoming a better Berkana Blacksmith with every blow of my hammer!   I know this is what I'm supposed to do  and as a human being I deserve like so many a simple small abode. I don't need a house and it's difficult to do what I do best make noise and smell of coal in built up areas  or whilst living with others.   I wish to become professional and also to eventually travel the nation and potentially Europe sharing and selling my work  and inspire others to consider a future in blacksmithing also!   I know there are so many good people out there that recognise I don't fit into anyones typical criteria/category but that I'm committed/hard working and passionately driven to    excel at what I do.   With your help and donation then I stand a chance at making something of myself!             ",True

I am 14 and I am looking to give back to my local community via the Food Bank.     Lockdown saw many people struggle and find themselves in need of help. One of the many charities who gave support through lockdown were the Food Banks.   From April 2019- March 2020  1.9 million food parcels were given to people in need.   From April 2020- September 2020 that number had already been beaten  with 1 239 399 emergency food parcels given.   (Statistics from the Trussell Trust website.)    The Trussell Trust are a charity who strive to ‘stop UK hunger’. They support a nationwide network of food banks and provide emergency food and support to people locked in poverty. They also campaign for change to end the need for food banks in the UK.   There are various ways of helping the food banks  from donating food  volunteering your time  direct donations or fundraising like me. If you would like to donate to the Trussell Trust directly  please visit their website at trusselltrust.org     I would like to give directly to my local food bank as they have given help and support to my own family when we have needed it.     Over the Easter Holidays I began to walk  run and jog a planned course to the top of Mount Everest. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to climb the real Mount Everest! But with the help of an app called The Conqueror  I was able to follow the 40 mile route that is usually taken by hikers  and map my progress. I added updates that detail the journey and there’s plenty of photos to check out. The app that I am using also plants a tree on my behalf every time I reach the next 20% marker  which means that you and I are not only helping the local Food Bank  but also our planet.     The profits raised after my challenge were spent purchasing items that the food bank can use to build food packages for families in my area. I used a local supermarket to get the best possible prices and actually shopped myself! Yes who knew that a 14 year old boy would voluntarily go food shopping!   Along the way I also learnt about period poverty in low income families  so I also brought sanitary products as the food bank also distribute toiletries.     This challenge was so successful  so I will continue to do these challenges and raise even more money in aid of the food bank. Many people still rely on a weekly food parcel and therefore food banks will still need our support. My next virtual journey is going to be The Giza Pyramids  so look out for updates in the next day or so!     If you would like to donate to my cause  I would be very grateful.

The boys wanted to get involved in the challenge to help raise money towards the charity Bags of Blessings to which i am trustee for.    Bags of Blessings is a local charity which support vulnerable children through public appeal for gifts. These are then packed into bags and distributed via food banks  homeless and refugee charities and other partner agencies. Our Christmas 2020 appeal saw us distribute 1 297 bags of gifts to young people aged from birth to 18 years  an increase of 61% on the previous year. This would not have been possible without the generosity of local people  schools and businesses  to whom we are very grateful.    Coronavirus has presented us with many challenges this year and home schooling has put extra pressure on parents and carers to educate and entertain children. Our focus is on children with limited or no use of laptops and devices to access the internet and restricted use of outside space  We have been making up lockdown Activity Packs with stationery items  coloring books  crayons/felt tips  crafts or a puzzle  sweets and a reading book  These have been distributed through our usual channels.    With spring in sight and Easter around the corner we have been making up Easter activity kits  which include a grow me kit this includes a plant pot  compost and seeds  Jack and Alfie have really enjoyed helping with the kits. The kits will also contain a reading book  craft kit and Easter chocolate.     Please help us in raising as much money as possible to support the amazing work Bags of Blessings do.

How We Began On the 1st April 2020 the Agape Ministry Food Bank was birthed we were responding to the obviously need in our Community in Brent caused by this dreadful Coronavirus pandemic. There were three volunteer workers: Amie Alexis  Sis Madge Facey and myself  Felicia Alexis. We had one box  which was by no means full  and a desire to minister to the church and the community. That day we distributed 9 bags.   In the weeks that followed we have seen God move in an amazing way. Members and friends of the Church rose to the challenge  they donated money on-line and donated food items to the Ministry over and over again. I have to pause here to say ‘thank you’ for your generosity. Heaven knows how many people you have impacted in a positive way. I would like to acknowledge not only those who have given  but to those who have prayed or volunteered their time in anyway as well. We are workers together with God and we are all doing our bit.   Some people will bring in one or two items some  several bags full. Nothing is too small or too big  all is received gratefully. From time to time we will receive surprise donations from the local butchers  restaurants  green grocers and even a school. Now we are into a new year still facing the pandemic and we are ministering to more and more people in the community. We see people every week from all different nationalities. Besides offering food we provide a safe place where people can come and feel the presence of God and find hope in a hopeless world. No one is rejected  everyone is accepted. Every week we provide tea  coffee  biscuits and cake for those coming in. Besides food  people are now looking for nappies  washing powder  readymade meals and even a vacuum cleaner. Our Faithful Volunteers I would like to mention the faithful volunteers that work with  me week after week. Sis Madge Facey  Sis Janet Ashman  Sis Fay Scott and my faithful husband Joseph Alexis. Bro Anthony Manning who sets a worshipful atmosphere with live music and Bro David Oram who comes every other week with his Healing banner and offers prayers for anyone who asks. I also would like to mention Bro Tim Stewart  who gets roped into helping me anytime he turns up and Sis Denice Denton who is there whenever she can be. We also have a young lady who lives in the community who has recently volunteered some of her time  to helping us with the ministry.   As we begin 2021 we will be inviting business people to partner with us by donating £100.00 for one month. In return the team will pray faithfully for the success of that business for the whole of that month and we will promote it. Joseph Alexis is the first ‘volunteer’ and his business is called Sixela Ltd  he provides a handyman services. He can be contacted on Telephone No. 07[phone redacted]93.

I'm raising money in aid of FAKENHAM BAPTIST COMMUNITY CHURCH and every donation will help. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to me.    Fakenham Baptist Community Church is based in Fakenham  North Norfolk  England. There has been a Baptist church in Fakenham in the centre of the town since 1801.    The idea of FBCC having larger premises was first discussed by the membership in 2016. The reasoning behind the move was that our congregation was growing  and the plans we had for community projects proved our current building was not large enough to suit our future.    Then following a legacy gift of £166 110 it was decided by a majority vote from the membership that we go ahead with seeking a suitable site for a new build.     After much searching we found what we thought was the ideal piece of land that is on Clipbush Lane  Fakenham. This site is situated in an industrial estate also surrounded by a pub and restaurant  a large supermarket and a new Doctors surgery  plus several hundred new build houses. There are plans for another 800 homes within the surrounding area in the next few years. By achieving the sale of the old church and paying off the old pension deficit  following many legal tangles we finally hired firms  broke ground and began building during 2019. The external shell has been erected  windows finished and internal mezzanine erected.    How can you help FBCC? We are now in the internal phase to finish our project with worship area  café  meeting rooms and community centre with your help we can achieve all that is required to provide the entire community with a ‘safe’ place to worship  play  counsel and breathe. Any donation however small can help towards our aims for the whole of Fakenham. To date we have spent over £500 000 but with your help we can achieve our goal to finish the project and begin the next phase of our exciting journey with the community of Fakenham.    What are the aims of this project? Our aims and objectives cannot be altered from our original statement in that ‘we know Jesus and make him known’. This is fundamental to everything we do. However we feel a responsibility to the community at large and to that end we will endeavour to provide help and guidance to those of our community who need it. By providing space for recreation for the youth of our town (whom we feel are neglected currently) and space for a crèche  toddlers group and a food bank resource  office space. We are not perfect as a church  we are a continuing work-in-progress and we too experience the ups and downs of life in these difficult times. However  we believe we have a big God who will guide us through these times and help us to build this church so that many people will benefit from what we will achieve for this community.

At Homeschool Social Enterprise we run a number of different services including a far-reaching food bank through our Ministry - Active Christians.    Over the years we have been supporting homeless people including those sleeping rough on the streets through the provision of food  clothing  prayer  signposting and emotional support.    Our intervention has helped many people  but unfortunately too many have slipped through the net and died on the streets due to extremely poor living conditions and health complications in most cases.     As a team  we have developed the skill to engage with many homeless people and several have even testified that our intervention has saved their lives on multiple occasions. The love and compassion that our volunteers have expressed towards the homeless has enabled lines of communication to remain open between us  whereas some of the homeless have chosen to reject the support of other agencies. This has created a negative cycle where many of the homeless remain homeless due to their refusal of help from other agencies. We want to change that.     Using our skills and knowledge of how to communicate with the homeless in a genuine and authentic way  we want to create a pathway once and for all that will provide shelter  rehabilitation and a sustainable plan that will move the homeless from sleeping rough to a life with hope and solid prospects.    We are raising money to purchase a purpose-built building or a block of houses that can be refurbished to accommodate a warehouse for our food bank  a homeless shelter and rehabilitation centre.    As well as the purchase of the building  the funds will be used to furnish the building with the correct equipment  develop the programmes that the homeless will participate in to succeed  secure the premises with the correct surveillance and security guards  hire fulltime staff and continue to provide food  drink and clothing for the service users.     We would like this programme to run for as long as possible with capacity for new service users to stay as reformed participants move on to live purposeful lives. The initial investment will support the running of the establishment however over time we aim to build processes that will enable us to monetise the project in order to make it self-sustainable e.g. to sell merchandise.

Following the success of the goodwill during the height of the pandemic last year  I am hoping to team up with community local champions in various boroughs to fight poverty through this initiative.   We are raising money to secure a central fulfilment centre so that we can centralise our efforts in reaching and providing out services daily.    We want to secure a space to not only cook and provide our meals but also provide a safe space where children can come and eat a warm meal and receive support and advice about life  from education to well being support.   What we need?  With lockdown easing and support for families also easing we want to ensure that families do not face the fear of not being able to feed their children.   To ensure that we can reach as many children and families as possible we need a permanent fulfilment centre where all our operations  services and activities can be centralised. ",True

So I'll be able to get a job. Enabling me to provide for my daughter  myself and give back to the community that has helped me so far with food banks etc. Around 2 years ago my life fell apart due to my mental health and it cost me my job  my family  my home. I ended up living in my car. During this time whilst living in my vehicle  on my way to a quiet spot to sleep after a couple of cans at a friend's house I was pulled over and breathalysed  the legal limit is 35  I blew a 38. I was arrested  charged and convicted and as a result I lost my licence. It was the lowest I've ever been and I nearly took my own life. Fast forward 18 months. I have my own flat in a lovely little village  I have my daughter weekly 3-5 days a week depending  and I have a licence again. My only issue is I can't find a job. See public transport does not exist from my village to the closest town of Kendal (11miles) where all the jobs are. I have looked for local jobs for the last 12 months but to no avail. I'm working with an organisation called 'Work and Health Programme' and they can line up interviews with companies in Kendal and I'm basically guaranteed a job as they work closely with said employers. I just can not get to any interviews  or shifts when offered the job. It's a catch 22  I can't get a car without a job  but I can't get a job without a car. Not just that but as I've just come off the back of a ban  as you can imagine my insurance is sky high. Like £2k for 1-1.4l. I am literally clutching at straws here  this is the last thing I can think of. I've asked for help off the government (job center) they flat out refused to help me. My family is small and non are in a position that could help me. I'm just stuck. As I mentioned the funds will go towards a well running car  tax  insurance and home delivery due to my inability to travel. I will be able to use this to start working again and stop being dependent on the government and community handouts. I would be eternally grateful and I just know it will mean everything for my little girl too as I will be able to see her everyday as I'll be able to drive over for tea and stuff. If I reach my goal and I'm able to go ahead  I will post videos and photos  I will also use my free time to volunteer in my local community by providing lifts to appointments and collecting shopping etc for those who can not. I will also create a page on Facebook so all who donate can follow updates. All monies received above my target will be donated to local support charaties too.

Her dreams to go back and see her family were crushed when the situation in her country deteriorated. Sarah was left with no choice but to apply for asylum in the UK in 2019.    Contrary to a misleading and divisive narrative  asylum seekers are not generally allowed to work in the UK until they are granted refugee status. This takes years of hardship and uncertainty. Moreover  being not allowed to work exposes people to the risk of exploitation.     Sarah is clearly in a very vulnerable situation. She needs our help to pay towards legal representation to hold her case. Our society needs Sarah - even during this pandemic she has been enriching many lives through her voluntary work at a local community kitchen.    She is very appreciated in her parish and is always there for whoever needs help  with a listening ear and a warm smile. Sarah has many relevant skills and has been sharing online healthy recipes of nutritious meals  prepared with very humble ingredients provided by food banks  which can always be useful to vulnerable families that need in-a-budget inspiration.    In her country of origin Sarah worked in human resources  a career she is passionate about and keen to continue. Her work allowed her to take care of people and in her voluntary work in the UK  she strives to serve the most vulnerable.     Sarah also volunteers in local charity shops. One of the managers said: “Sarah is a caring  honest person who fitted into the team very quickly. She is very professional in her work and fun to be around. I wish her all the best with her residency to this country’’.    Her vicar writes: “Sarah has engaged fully with the life of the church and community and is keen to help out in a number of different ways. From supporting the running of our services to helping out with community projects and encouraging people.     She is always cheerful and positive and is clearly a capable and talented lady who has proved herself trustworthy and honest. It is very frustrating for her that she cannot work to earn a living to support herself because of the extended time taken with her asylum application.”    A friend of Sarah said: “I have known her for about two years. She is so kind and thoughtful and she always considers the feelings of others’’.     A local Councillor added: “If allowed to stay I am sure Sarah would continue to make a positive contribution as a member of our community.”    Let us make it happen  let us donate towards Sarah’s legal fees.
