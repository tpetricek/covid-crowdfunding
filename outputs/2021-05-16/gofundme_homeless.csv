We are forming a ramshackle volunteer tag team clocking-off the miles in jogs  dog walks  rambles and bike rides in return for donations to keep WSO Central running until such time as it can return to being a working pub again.    The Station Hotel in Ashton-Under-Lyne currently feeds hundreds of people a week and works to ensure housing and support for anyone falling through the gaps in the safety net  from those sleeping on the street to those isolated by age or illness  and the hundreds of children currently counted as the 'Hidden Homeless' in often inadequate and temporary accommodation.    If you can help with a few miles please join the Facebook group 'WSO: We Shall Overrun 2021'  and if you can spare a donation to this fundraiser it would be very much appreciated by all involved in WSO  but none more so than those who you will be helping by keeping The Station open.

Our support to the Community    Food Parcels - Gas - Electric - Boiler Repairs - Plumbing Repairs - Funeral cost Help - Free Boilers - Combat Rogue Traders - Homeless Support and Community Care.    We meet many Elderly and Vulnerable people every week and they all have one thing in common  the worry of choosing between heating and eating  having to borrow from companies or family to cover the cost of being warm or with hot water.  The majority of Elderly and Vulnerable people believe that they are a burden to society and family  they lock themselves away and hide. This could end as a tragedy if they do not receive the help they need.      Depher gives them that help  No tears  No begging and No sadness just the help they need when they are in their hour of need          ( DEPHER CIC ) was established in March 2017 in response to an elderly Gentleman nearly being conned out £5500.00  Depher is a NOT FOR PROFIT community interest company with the sole purpose of supporting the communities of the United Kingdom  an achievement that has been challenging for many years.    During the last 4 years we have delivered a staggering £430 000 worth of support for the communities in many parts of the UK  with another £87 000 alone being allocated since the Covid-19 pandemic started last Year.  Our core clients are Elderly  Vulnerable and Disabled members of the community  who rely on our services as a life line and a voice of reason  hope and help when they need it the most  especially when they feel alone and confused.    THE LADY ABOVE IS SADLY NO LONGER WITH US  THIS SMILE WAS DELIVERED BY DEPHER BEFORE THE WORLD LOST THAT BEAUTIFUL SMILE.    Depher over the last 12 months has answered to the calls for help from the Government  Communities  NHS  Carers  businesses and the homeless.  We have given every minute and every second of every day to help in the protection and preservation of our lives  loved ones and communities  without want or without question.  We do however have overheads to pay for  including Materials and stock that allows us to deliver this service to the communities.  We are NOT funded or supported by the Government  Councils or any Charities but they all use our services for their community members  we have approached them for financial help without any luck or promise.    We are proud to announce that we have delivered our services to 11 900 families since the launch  amongst them are many that have been saved from Suicide and Self harm  Carbon Monoxide and Gas leaks  Rouge Traders and Conmen  Poverty and Hunger  Water Leaks plus much more.  We have also had many lovely awards that we are so proud of  you can see them by going on our website or googling our company name  it is so humbling and heavenly receiving these not only for us but for all the members of the community  our depher community family.    ABOVE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE WE HAVE HELPED OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS AND MORE  LOOK AT THE SMILES.    We are now looking at a future that is very uncertain for Depher CIC  this is because funding has reduced massively and the cost of delivering this service has soared massively.  We do not want to close the Depher doors for good because so many users and families would suffer  that would cause so much heart ache and pain  this is a fear we see but don't want to face.    CAN YOU PLEASE SUPPORT DEPHER CIS - BUT MOST OF ALL CAN YOU PLEASE SUPPORT THE ELDERLY  DISABLED AND VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES.    We are all going through and facing a future together that we all fear because of the Pandemic  but imagine a elderly  vulnerable or disabled person who is alone  scared and cold without funds to keep warm or remove the danger.  Imagine a person who cannot pay for food  PPE  household bills or repairs being suicidal because they think that is the only answer.   We see all this daily  from Mothers and Grandmothers or Dads and Grandads living with life threatening dangers every day  without the means to repair or replace the dangers.    THE GENTLEMAN ABOVE WAS MY FRIEND  HE IS NO LONGER WITH US AND IT HURTS  MONTHS BEFORE HIS PASSING HE WAS SAT IN 3 COATS BECAUSE IT WAS SO COLD.    THE PEOPLE WHO NEED OUR HELP ARE IN NEED OF ONGOING SUPPORT AFTER OUR WORK IS DONE  THAT IS WHAT WE PUT INTO PLACE WHEN WE HAVE FINISHED. IF WE DISAPEAR  WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM.     Many Vulnerable people are suffering in silence and will not ask anyone else for help  this means that if we cannot help or shut our doors they may or will suffer or become targets of desperation and poverty  only the public and the kind support can keep us going until we can hopefully persuade the government  councils and charities to support us  we hope that day does happen.    THE SMILE SAYS IT ALL  WOULD YOU HELP TO KEEP THE SMILE GOING AND PASS IT TO OTHERS    Your support however small or large will save a life and stop the suffering of thousands that are alone and forgotten.

We’ve occasionally fed him too as he’s always seemed very hungry when popping around. Our own cat has known him too since he was a kitten  they sometimes hang out together!    This time  though  we decided to keep the homeless cat in as he looked quite poorly. He’s a calm and kind cat and has so much love to give. He’s an old boy  as we found out to our surprise and quickly changed his name from Snow White to Milky.    During a recent visit to the vet we found out that the pimple that he has on his ear is actually a sign of SCC (squamous cell carcinoma)  quite usual for white cats like him. The vet told us that he’s strong for his age 12-13  and that with an operation to move the tumour on the earlob  could enjoy few more happy cat years.   But the operation cost for an uninsured cat is c. £800. That’s a lot of money for us.   This is when we decided to rescue Milky and ask our neighbours  family  friends and the wider community to help us raise the money needed for his operation.   If you’d like to give us a hand in keeping this lovable cat alive  please donate. We are very grateful for any amount and so is Milky too..!",False

The total number of households in temporary accommodation in England increased by 75%  between 2010 and 2019. Rough sleeping  meanwhile  increased by 141% between 2010 and 2019.  This does not account for the ‘hidden homeless’  i.e. sofa-surfers  people living in squats or other  insecure accommodation  who will not be known to authorities.    In a report issued by Shelter (charity) in December 2020  it was revealed that 253 000 people in England are homeless and living in temporary accommodation during the pandemic – the highest figure for 14 years.     Rising homelessness is already a major problem – with the latest figures showing 115 000 more people are homeless and trapped in temporary accommodation than a decade ago – but Shelter argues the economic chaos caused by Covid-19 risks turbo-charging the crisis. The charity’s analysis of government data shows the number of people in temporary accommodation jumped by 6 000 in the first three months after the pandemic struck.    Having grown around costal towns for most of my life  I have in some way always been close to the issue of homelessness on the south coast without thinking of the people impacted. After spending many days on Covid approved walks (many... MANY walks!) I began seeing/thinking more about those impacted by rough sleeping  and how Covid-19 had potentially further alienated people in need of help and support. The Charities I have chosen to fundraise for are close to my local community  and provide support services to people who face becoming homeless and those already with no where to go.     Any donation is a welcome donation! I hope to be able to raise £1000 to split between my chosen charities (obviously anything more would be AMAZING) I will be logging my training/final ride when it takes place.. so keep posted for content on the ride.

We have until 28 May to leave the house.    The landlady evicted me after I told her I could not afford to move out until later this year.    She is intentionally making me homeless.    I have less than £300 in my bank account. And I need £1 500 to move.    I’m a lodger. I have no legal way to stop or delay an eviction. It’s legal for my landlord to change the locks and leave all my belongings on the pavement when I’m out.    So I’m facing being homeless. I do not have the mental strength to deal with homelessness. It would break me.    This is the second time I’ve had to move in 6 months. I was a lodger at a place in Finchley. I moved out in October  because that landlord had begun making violent threats.    Now I face a similar situation. But in October I had the money to move out quickly.    Mental health  I’ve got a history of mental health problems.    All my life I’ve had periods of deep depression that last years and anxiety disorder. Last year  I learned I have ADHD  which feeds into both anxiety and depression.    When I was depressed and living comfortably  I’ve had to fight against suicidal thinking when depressed.    Right now  the depression is at bay. But I’m at risk of have a relapse when life is good. Add the stress of no home  I’m in danger.    The Squatter  If I can’t find a place soon  I face having to rehome my cat  “The Squatter”.    I don’t want to do that. Caring for her has kept me alive during my darkest periods.    I don’t want her to go in a shelter. She’s 12 now - her breed live for around 15 years - so it’ll be hard to find a new home for her as old cats are rarely adopted.    Job loss  A few weeks before the eviction notices one of my two regular clients  whom I’ve worked for every week for more than five years  told me they arw halving my hours.    My income from them dropped from £800/month to £400.    The week before the eviction  they told me they are cancelling my contract any time from June onwards.    Any chance I had to pay for a move at short notice has disappeared now.    What your money is for  Most of the £1 500 would cover a deposit and one month’s rent for a room.     It’s a lot  because I live in London.    Any left over will go to van hire to do the move  and to put things in storage for a few weeks.    Any excess will either be refunded. If I can’t do that  it goes to charity - either a local one to help people in my situation  Shelter or Mind.    A real possibility is that I’ll have to take a loan (or loans) from a pay-day loan provider to secure a place at short notice. If I do  your money will be used to pay off the principle of those loans.     Donors will be informed of the costs I’ve incurred during the move.    Not just GoFundMe   I am taking other action while I search for a place for me and the Squatter.    I’m applying for financial support from Newham Council  as part of a homeless prevention policy  and emergency grant from the National Union of Journalists.    I’m selling stuff I don’t need to survive - books  a PC  rowing machine.    I’m trying to get more freelance work and a new full-time job.     But I don’t know if any of that money - if any - will get to me in time.    The eviction  During April  the landlady repeatedly threatened to evict one of us at random for unspecified reasons.    On 24 April  I emailed her to say I plan to move out in a few months’ time  once I’d set aside the money to move. And I explained I could not  move out this month  as I didn’t have the money.    When she asked why I was leaving  as politely as I could  I explained that her behaviour was effecting my mental health. Her last threat of evicting someone at random put me on the edge of a panic attack- I haven’t had one of those in more than a year.    On 1 May - a Saturday - I paid my rent for the month. A few hours later she issued eviction notices to all of us.    That Monday was a bank holiday. Every avenue for help was closed as it was a publicity holiday. So it until Thursday before I could get legal advice from Shelter.    The law  In England and Wales there’s no way for a lodger to stop an eviction.    A lodger lives in their landlord’s home as a guest. If they try and stay after an eviction date  basically they’re a trespasser.    Once I’ve moved  there are steps I can take to possibly recover some rent I’ve paid her. There are in motion. But there’s nothing legally I can do right now.    The landlady  The landlady seemed nice when I moved in. But she gradually changed and her behaviour became more erratic  bordering on delusional.    Her behaviour was affecting my mental health  so I decided to leave.  After I got the eviction notice  I learned she was renting out rooms illegally. And may have doing so for 8 years.    In Newham  London  all landlords need a licence to rent house or even rooms. It seem she has never had one.    Aside from that  she’s been dishonest with myself and my housemates.    She claims poverty  but she has a second house in London.    She didn’t have an account with Thames Water for the water bill  but told me she did. Thames Water set one up in my name (they got it from credit history agencies). Now I have to pay it as my landlady has refused to set one up in her name. Aside from my rent including bills  lodgers should not be responsible for utility bills.    He behaviour has become increasing erratic. She has been blaming myself and housemates for things that haven’t happened and we haven’t done. She demands that we follow house rules she ignores. And when we complain and show evidence that contradicts here - whether it’s video  text messages or witnesses - she ignores anything that goes against her reality.    That’s just the highlights.    What’s next?  I honestly don’t know. I’m optimistic and fighting back  but I’m also scared.    Whatever you can donate will help.",False

Battle Buddy UK is a community interest company (CIC) founded by veterans.  We identified a gap with the long-term support and treatment of those suffering from complex mental health problems within the veteran community. We are unique and our key differentiation is that there are few organisations who understand; and can treat the complex needs which many ex-servicemen and women present. In addition to the daily struggle that veterans face  their families are also face little to no support. This has a hugely detrimental effect on their marriages and relationships  which in turn impacts the veterans’ wellbeing. Battle Buddy was formed to combat such deficits and we are passionate about helping and assisting veterans.    Battle Buddy UK has a 24/7 helpline for veterans and their families seeking support and advice from veterans alike. We are here to make sure that you can get the help you need to rebuild your life for the better  and we’re there for you every step of the way. We are a hub for veterans to turn to when they need support there and then  and also following on from that into the future.

This is something I have  always wanted to do and at the age of 70 I thought it’s about time I did it. I would   like to be able to raise some money for charity whilst doing this.    The skydive is being organised through the Mayor of Rushmoor’s Charity to raise money for two local charities which are: Parity for Disability and Broadhurst   Mental Distress. Parity was formed in 1991 to provide facilities for young people with multiple  disabilities to help them escape mental  emotional and physical deterioration.  These young people go from school to nothing and Parity run three centres to  provide the vital facilities and support they need for this transition. Due to   COVID  the Parity charity shops have been closed for months  losing much   needed funds to be able to run the centres and offer this support.    Broadhurst Mental Distress is a local charity which exists to provide medium to   long term help and support to those with serious mental illness in Rushmoor and  the surrounding area. They also began funding The Vine Centre to enhance the  provision of its mental health support amongst the homeless people in Rushmoor.    I am funding myself to do this skydive so every penny that I can raise through  sponsorship will be split between these two worthy causes. I would be very  grateful if you feel you would like to sponsor me - thank you for your time in   reading this. Wish me luck and a safe landing ",False

Sadly we only recently discovered this chairty and found out that they do not receive much support. They are deprived of necessities and are in urgent need of food and vital amenities.     There are over 150 children/adults who have been abandoned and live at this orphanage/care home. 41 are children aged 6-18 (4 girls and 37 boys). Some are orphans  some have been abandoned by their parents who want to remarry  have mental health issues and can no longer care for them or are in mental institutions or even prison.    The rest are adults or the elderly who have nobody or were abandoned by their families and made homeless so they rely on the association as a shelter.    Our aim is to raise £5000 to buy them as much food as we can. Any extra funds we raise will be put towards buying them clothes and toys.     Samia and Aya are currently in Morocco and have visited the association. They were able to buy them some necessities but this is nowhere near enough. The kids were so happy to see the ketchup and the snacks they took so we want to buy them more and more!     Samia and Aya will be volunteering at the association over the next few weeks. They will also be buying and delivering all the items once we reach our goal.    We will be providing updates so everyone can see the process and delivery of the items.     Please help us share and spread the word. X      This is Rahma. She was an orphan. She came to the association when her husband left her 18 years ago when she was heavily pregnant and had nowhere to go. She now manages the association  cleans and has dedicated her life to look after all the kids herself. She said sometimes there is not enough food to feed all the kids.     ",False

Beginning in March 2020  we have delivered 600 meals a week  every week  free of charge to the most in need in South Birmingham. Through great effort  including invaluable help from many volunteers  we have racked up an impressive thirty thousand meals delivered since the first Lockdown one year ago.     We currently operate out of a single kitchen at the Jericho Building in Balsall Heath  and primarily service the wards of Hall Green  Moseley  Kings Heath  Ladywood  Basall Heath  Hockley  Sparkbrook  & Sparkhill. In these areas  we serve a great number of low-income families from diverse ethnic backgrounds  elderly residents  and vulnerable communities  some of whom belong to the homeless community.    We are about to run out of generous funding that we have so far relied on to do this important work  just at a time when we are seeing an increase in need for our services due to the economic impacts of the pandemic. We have seen that across the city  the need for food banks has doubled.    If we are to carry on this much-needed work  then we need your help in the form of any donations you can spare to help the staff and volunteers of ChangeKitchen achieve our goals over the next six months.        Our Running Cost:  So far we have maintained our level of service through grants from the Social Enterprise Support Fund (SESF) [via The National Lottery Community Fund]  and through working hand-in-hand with other charities and social enterprises within movements such as #BrumTogether  initially with the support of Birmingham City Council.     Unfortunately  this grant support is coming to an end in March  and the next round of funding is not available until July. It is therefore imperative that we find the extra donations to carry on this vital work and upgrade our infrastructure to meet the demands of the coming financial year.    It currently costs us about £4000 a month to run our social enterprise. This money goes towards wages  rent  insurance  van hire  and food to top-up the surplus  amongst other expenses.    We estimate the total cost will rise to £5000 in the coming months  in line with meeting increased future demand.    Also  our kitchen is in need of repair and refitting  since 2 out of 3 of our ovens have failed  and we are in the process of procuring a dishwasher given our increasing output.    Where we get our food donations from:  •Waitrose via FareShare Go  •Incredible Surplus (formerly TRJFP Brum) Winson Green Sharehouse  •Our partners in the #BrumTogether network   •Other food via FareShare  more recently via Coop NISA / Ruprai in Kings Heath          What We Need:    We need financial support to do the following over the next six months:    Provide a further 400 meals per week  bringing us up to 1000 meals a week.    Replace our 2 failed ovens with 1 modern  professional fan oven  so that we can increase our food output.    Upgrade our kitchen backend with some new pots  pans  and utensils to keep up with our increased workload.    What we need from you / other opportunities to help:  Although this is a fundraiser  there are other ways in which you can help us. From donating your time volunteering  to sharing our appeal for help via social media and word of mouth.    Monetary donations:    We are hoping with donations from the general public and private enterprise to raise enough to cover our general running costs and upgrade our kitchen. Any help you can give will be greatly appreciated by ourselves and the greater community we serve.    The Social Supper Club:    The Social Supper Club is ChangeKitchen’s latest offering  creating innovative mealboxes to pick up and heat & enjoy at home. This helps us (and you!) to do even more good because for every £20 spent  ChangeKitchen CIC will provide £5 of nutritious homemade meals back into the local community.    Volunteering:    We are always looking for interested volunteers to help towards the work of prepping  cooking  and cleaning at our busy Jericho Kitchen in Balsall Heath. Please get in touch at [email redacted] for more information.     Social media    Please share this page amongst your friends and any local Facebook groups to help our fundraiser get seen by as many people as possible. ",False

He’d started walking from Kent 10 months ago when he became homeless and not wanting to be stagnant and homeless or turn to begging for money he decided to start walking. He just recently passed through my village on the north coast of Cornwall. When I chanced upon him  he was tired in need of respite and his equipment was damaged so he spent a few days staying in our caravan to recuperate. He soon went off on his way again and I asked him he would mind me sharing a bit of his story and to ask if people could keep an eye out for him.    He had some pretty shocking stories about his experiences of sleeping rough and peoples tolerance of homelessness. The fact that he’s turned some elements of his misfortunes into a journey and into something positive is really quite amazing. As well as being homeless he is mildly autistic he is very lovely and walking the coastline  heading North and if you would like to help him on his journey he needs a new tent and some food and my husband and I are trying to find a way to help him so that he can have some security for a while.

Whether homeless or in desperate need  Humdingers is here to weekly provide hot meals in a warm and friendly environment to everyone that needs it. Our goal is to make a big difference in the lives of hundreds giving them the support they need.      Since beginning of 2020  we have distributed over 100 000 meals either during food collection or working with other local community organisations for drop offs in London. During the Covid-19 pandemic last year  Humdingers was providing 800 meals a week for the vulnerable and over 500 meals a day to the NHS front line workers  unfortunately this figure has increased this year to 1 000 meals a week. A figure that shouldn’t be the reality  but it is.       As a result of the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic  we have had an influx of people needing additional support. So  in 2021 we are expanding our Soup Kitchen facilities to a new site in Hornsey (picture below)  which is a huge project for us to financially take on alone  but we recognise the importance of being able to continue providing that much needed support to the vulnerable members of the community.       We have received a colossal amount of recognition for Humdingers Soup Kitchen  with the owner Rob Hunningher receiving a British Empire Medal  in The Queens Honours list October 2020. However  we need your help. The impact of Covid-19 has left a disastrous financial impression on us all  but most of all for those who were already on the edge and are not able to provide meals for themselves or their loved ones. From as little to as much as you can give  please donate so we are able to continue providing free meals for those in need and supporting the members of our community that vitally need our help.

There is an amazing gentleman named Barry here in Knutsford who  armed with some equally fab volunteers run HOMELESS PROJECT MANCHESTER.   Together they help the homeless men & women on Manchester City Centre's streets.     We have had a particularly bad winter with immense rainfall  flooding  snow & gales  freezing temperatures and of course the threat of COVID-19 everywhere you go. I cannot begin to imagine what it would be like to spend just 1 hour on these streets in these conditions yet these guys who have lost their way have no choice but to call it home. There are a few shelters available but the truth in those is  unfortunately they tend to be more dangerous than being on the actual street.......It truly is heartbreaking.     Friday 29th January 21 - The project team ventured into Manchester City Centre again with provisions for the homeless on the streets - hot food  warm clothes  new sleeping bags - all donated by the generous citizens of Knutsford and surrounding areas. The volunteers also provide some light relief to their desperate situation. One of the young men they met and chatted to was called John Wrench  he was 25 years of age.     Just 3 days later Monday 1st February  John died of Hypothermia.    That is in 2021  In the UK. He was 25.    Unfortunately he is not alone - I have no idea what the answer is but one of the key facts is that yes we can donate clothes & sleeping bags - but as soon as they are wet from the rain (this is Manchester!) they are useless and are discarded - So they need something more substantial to protect them from the outdoor elements. Searches have come up with a waterproof portable sleeping bag - it costs just £5. It is made of aluminium foil and has a metal coating on the surface  the inner layer is PE plastic film  which can reflect the heat back to the body in order to keep you warm. It is also extremely compact and can fold up to fit in your hand which has obvious benefits for the homeless.    Nobody should be dying on the streets in our country in this year of Hypothermia. So I am asking for donations so we can supply these human beings a way to hopefully keep dry and warm on the streets this year.    Thank-you x          ",False

Hi I’m Kim and this is Kobe ❤️  This month we are running 300 kilometres to help raise money for Newstart Orphanage & Day Care Centre in Eastern Cape South Africa.   The special centre was created by an incredible woman called Nonkosi Ntloko to offer a safe environment and loving home for orphaned and vulnerable children. Many of these children have suffered traumas and several have severe medical needs.  The money raised will go towards schooling  food  clothing  medicine  toys and day to day care for the children that are there.It’s an amazing cause and if you can help share and show your support with a donation we would be forever grateful and it would mean so much to Nonkosi and the children at Newstart. ❤️          Here is a little more about Nonkosi and why she created Newstart Orphanage & Daycare Centre.    Nonkosi first started the home in 2011 when she found their were many homeless and abandoned children alone on the streets. Some of these children were as young as 2 years old. Nonkosi knew she had to help. She decided to re purpose her home to build her own orphanage to give these children a new start in life.   Since opening her home Nonkosi has even taken in many new born babies that have been found abandoned and alone  she has been able to give them a real chance at life and a place they can flourish.  Newstart Orphanage & Daycare Centre offers a safe loving environment and home  where children receive support and education and can have ambitions and aspirations for their future. Nonkosi devotes all her time to caring for the children  currently she has 11 children living with her permanently and around 40-50 children visit the daycare centre for food  playtime  and a safe space during the day.    The pandemic has made things very difficult as more children are being brought to the home at the same time donations have decreased and Nonkosi is struggling to provide for all the new children coming in.  They are in desperate need of financial support to care for all the extra children there.    Here are some numbers to show how far your donations can go -    £10 can buy 100 nappies (they go through a lot!)  £20 can feed a child for a month    £40 can sustain a child with everything they need food/water/schooling/clothing/transport/medicine/schoolbooks and a warm safe environment at Newstart.    £80 can pay for a child’s school fees for 1 whole year    £1500 can sustain all of the children for 3 months    £6000 can sustain all of the children for a whole year!    We would love to raise £6000 to help all the children at Newstart  it would make the world of difference to them.  Please help me make that happen! And help Nonkosi to continue with the incredible work that she does. ❤️  Thanks for reading   Kim and Kobe xxx    Stay tuned for to see our progress and for furry running snaps! Hi I’m Kobe I was also found on my own as a small puppy before I was given a new home. I am running to help all of my friends at Newstart Orphanage and Daycare Centre. Please sponsor me to help raise money to keep my friends safe and give them a loving home ❤️   Woof     ",False

My daughter is liaising with Matthew Mark  Chief Executive of the Mission  in order to dedicate a memorial to him  possibly a dedicated bed for the Homeless.

Nice to meet you.    The last year has been hard for everyone! It’s been bizarre and unsettling  and we all deserve a break.     During this time of uncertainty  I have turned my energies and focus to something certain in my life  my music. I started playing guitar when I was nine and it has always been my emotional refuge.    I enjoy writing funny and silly songs for friends and special events. A good friend of mine has a birthday in December and he has never looked forward to it  he says that birthdays in December are often overshadowed by Christmas. One year  he was having a bad time of things  so I wrote him a funny birthday song to cheer him up  and you know what? It worked! The song is called ‘December Babies’ and is about the struggle of having a birthday during the festive season. I recorded the song very quickly to make sure it was ready in time for his birthday  it was full of mistakes and not at all polished  but this all added to its charm!    During the lockdowns I have spent my time re-recording this song and making a demo. It seemed like a perfect opportunity to take on a big project  I really enjoyed working on it and found a positive focus during a negative time. My abilities are limited however  I am a mere guitarist and I get stumped with drums and vocals. Getting other people involved in the midst of a pandemic has not been an easy process!    After a lot of thought  I have decided to give myself one year to get ‘December Babies’ released as a non-profit  charity Christmas song. Christmas is my favourite time of the year  but for a lot of people it isn’t so much fun. Homelessness is hard at all times of the year  but coldness  commercialism  indulgence and isolation are also things that sadly come with the season  and after the year we’ve all had  more and more people are struggling to make ends meet. With this in mind  I am hoping to produce ‘December Babies’ and release it with all of the proceeds from downloads and purchases going to ‘Shelter’  a homeless charity that helps to protect and house people living on the streets and in poor conditions.    So  what do I need to achieve my goal and make my ‘December Babies’ dream come true?    I need access to a studio  and the help of other instrumentalists (especially a drummer) and a singer. I have never done this before  and I am very excited by the prospect that my music could be professionally produced  but more so that it could be used to help those in need. As I mentioned before  the COVID-19 pandemic has left many people  including creatives in financially precarious positions  and as such I have struggled to find folk who are able to work for free. Recording is by its nature an expensive and time-consuming process.    I am looking to raise £800 to cover the costs of creating my charity single  and I was wondering if you can help me with this please? I think it would be very fitting for this charitable endeavour to be created by the kindness of people. Any donation  big or small is greatly appreciated  and I hope that ‘December Babies’ can put a smile on many people’s faces!    Breakdown of estimated costs to be covered in the production process:    - Studio fees  up to £300    - Drummer  £200    - Vocalist  £200    - Unforeseen costs £100    Any donations not used in the production process will be given ‘Shelter.’",False
