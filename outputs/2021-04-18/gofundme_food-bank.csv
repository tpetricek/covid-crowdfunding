We have decided to set up this page to try and raise some money for North Liverpool food bank in the process. Now more than ever in the current climate people are struggling more and more in this day and age it is shocking to think that some family’s cannot afford to put food on the table these food banks are so important & they do an unbelievable job keeping the local community going. If there is any possibility you can donate to this essential cause no matter how small it can make a massive difference to a family’s life. Thank you Do you want to join me in making a difference? I'm raising money in aid of St Andrew's Community Network and every donation will help. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to me.    More information about St Andrew's Community Network: We work to provide a range of holistic and practical services to support local families and disadvantaged people in inner city Liverpool. We support some of the most vulnerable in our area  and hope to move people from a position of crisis and vulnerability  towards stability and life fulfilment. ",False

Free Meals  Full Hearts is designed to bridge that gap and ensure that if your situations changes quickly  or you just need a little help - we're here for you. Anonymously.    I have heard some truly eye opening stories since creating this charitable group - everything from families only eating one meal a day and a couple who hadn't had a hot meal in days to another family who had literally only eaten canned beans and hoops for 10 days solidly because their weekly food budget was £9 to feed 5. It really does put life in perspective.    No-one in our community should go hungry. Ever.    The Reading community has shown time and time again that when faced with challenges or adversities  we come together. The camaraderie  generosity and positivity around us every day is overwhelming.    Feeding yourself and your family is a basic but essential human necessity but unfortunately far too many people in the Reading area are skipping meals and going hungry because they simply can't afford to eat. I can only imagine this must be particularly heartbreaking if you're a parent who is unable to feed your children. As momentum has increased and more and more people have heard about Free Meals  Full Hearts and we occasionally find ourselves struggling to help due to lack of physical food donations. When this happens  I either dip into the reserve pot or sometimes  out of my own pocket i'll buy emergency food shops for families (between £30-£50 per week depending on the size of the family). I have also ordered last minute takeaways for families and bought other essential items such as medical prescriptions and personal hygiene and cleaning products    'Free Meal  Full Hearts' is a anonymous platform where people (single  couples or families) can reach out and ask for food should they need to  without judgement.    If you are able to help  please do. It's massively appreciated - not just by me  but by every family who are committed to helping    Thank You    Newpaper Article",False

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.    All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.    If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free. Thankyou for your support.    The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need  providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.    All the best    Jack Monroe.

We are continuing to support these families in term time and the holidays.     £50 raised will be able to feed 25 young people    £100 raised will be able to feed 50 young people    £1000 raised will be able to feed 500 young people     There is power in our community. Join us.        Food provision through schools and youth clubs play an essential role in providing food for children and families who are in need of it - this is especially true during the holidays  when Free School Meals (FSM) are not usually available. Recently  the government (after several U-turns) decided to extend funding for FSM over the school holidays  but several families received substandard food packages that still forced them to rely on extra aid from food banks and mutual aid community groups.    Many young people are also not entitled to free school meals during term time because their parents earn above the amount allowed for eligibility for free school meals. In England  earnings from employment must be less than £16 190 for families in receipt of Child Tax or Working Tax Credits  and only £7 400 per year for families in receipt of Universal Credit.     This is staggeringly low and  when combined with measures such as the two child limit on Universal Credit payments  means that many families struggling to put food on the table are nevertheless deemed ineligible for free school meals. Other families are unable to claim FSM for their children because they have no recourse to public funds (NPRF) which is a condition the government imposes on some families due to their immigration status.      What does this mean?    Those recently impacted by the financial costs of COVID-19 (which are only increasing)  are more likely to go hungry. This will have bothphysiological and psychological impacts on young people and their families.     Why?    The data collected by CPAG on child poverty in the UK are enraging: 4.2 million children were living in poverty in the UK in 2018-19  out of which 700 000 were in London. This has been worsened by the fact that parents and carers are twice as likely to lose their jobs due to the pandemic.     In Lewisham  according to Trust for London   37% of children are in a situation of food insecurity  and 14% of the population needs social benefits to survive. It's deeply distressing that this level of inequality exists in the UK  particularly given that we are one of the richest countries in the world.     Don’t know what living with food insecurity feels like? See here .    The figures above reflect the shocking inequality in Britain  which was already severely impacting children and young people before the worst financial effects caused by the pandemic began to be felt. Due to the government’s lackluster response to the pandemic  it is projected that the number of children in poverty will increase to 5.2 million by 2022.     We also cannot ignore that this impact has not been distributed equally: people coming from Communities of Colour and immigrant background are over twice as likely to live in hardship than their white British counterparts and  due to the wider structural racial injustices  these communities are also disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. We are certainly not 'all in this together'.      What are we doing about it?     Legendary Community Club  which was named by Chevrington Odoh from the Pro Plus FC   is a grassroots project set up by some members of Lewisham Mutual Aid in partnership with local organisations. Our aim is to deliver emergency food provision to ensure that young people do not go without out  for as long as there is a need.       We will make this happen in three ways:    1. Temporary food provisions have been set-up for families who require this support  in partnership with local schools and community groups.    2. A kitchen has been set up to prepare nutritionally balanced meals for young people through their youth clubs which run after school and in the school holidays.    We know that food charity is not a long term solution. This is not the world we want to live in and we refuse to normalise food banks as a solution to food poverty. This is NOT an inevitable situation.    3. With this in mind  we will continue to work alongside The Children's Society  who have been calling on the government to ensure that every local council adequately funds emergency support for families   so that nobody is left behind in a time of crisis. For more information about their campaign 'Strengthening the Safety Net' see here   and sign the petition here.    We will also continue to support the calls from Save the Children and Child Poverty Action Group who have been lobbying for reforms to the benefits system  as well as an increase in the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit by £20  and an end to the two child limit and the £20 000 a year benefit cap which hits families in high-rent areas such as Lewisham particularly hard. Lastly  we will continue to support IFAN with the #CashFirst campaign  which has already inspired us to start our very own community-led participatory research project (stay tuned for more on this!).     The way our tax and welfare system is designed is a political choice. There are solutions . We will call on the government and its representatives to be bold  brave and radical in how they approach this problem.       What will we use the funds for?      We will use the money raised from the community to buy food and equipment for the project.    We have a host of volunteers  and multiple clubs and schools signed up and ready to go.

My goal a to raise £400 in the half term period  in response to the amazing effort that the industry I work in (hospitality) is making during the worst crisis to hit our sector. Even though we face the uncertainty of job losses and establishments being shut down  we are seeing free food and offers being made to help others who are in need. The local and national effort being made this half term shows us all how proud we should be that we all stand together when the do do hits the fan. No child should ever go hungry  and as much as I’d like blame the government and politicians for the lack of action  it won’t help me raise the funds",False

The girls have spent their full time in New Zealand in lock down and are desperate to get home.     We appreciate and understand that it is a hard time for everyone but we are pleading for any donation you have even if it be £1 or 2 because it will all help and be so greatly appreciated.    Sarah is a key worker for a local care home and during all of this she is needed back home.    Due to being stuck in New Zealand finances are strained for both girls.    There are flights available from New Zealand to London but these are coming in at a higher cost than their original return flight.    As of yet there are no repatriation flights available for New Zealand however if they do become available they will be prioritised in categories. List of families with young kids  elderly & vulnerable so the girls are at the bottom of the list and not classed as a priority.    They have contacted their travel insurance provider but all they could do is cover the girls health care until they return home.     The girls are becoming increasingly desperate to return home and are mentally exhausted and struggling being 2 young girls in a foreign country for so long  especially when emotions are so heightened due to covid19.     At the moment we are unable to provide a cost for the price of flights as they are changing but minimum could be minimum £1500.     If our circumstances change (i.e they get a flight with their original airline) then any money raised will be donated to the NHS/ local food banks.       PLEASE HELP US BRING OUR GIRLS HOME!!!",False

By request I have set up a gofundme to cover ingredient costs. Anything raised above the goal will go to the local food bank.    Original Facebook post below:    Hello! As you may know  this week 322 MPs voted AGAINST a £15 a week food voucher for children in low-income families. If you’re struggling with feeding your kids next week during half term and live in Weston  I’d like to help!    I can’t change the world  but I can cook  and I’d like to offer eight families a free hot lunch on Monday  Tuesday and Wednesday next week. I’ll drop it off between 12pm and 2pm  please message me your address and how many are in your household.     When I was 17 I had a new baby and had just lost my mum. I was in and out of jobs because of my grief and mental health and I struggled to survive on the little help I got. I’ve not had enough money to pay my gas bill before and have had to cook pasta in the microwave to make sure my daughter got lunch  and I firmly believe that poverty isn’t a choice but an unfortunate circumstance  unlike our current government who think that hungry kids are a byproduct of parents simply ‘not being responsible’.     I manage these days and I’d like to pay it forward for all the times someone in the queue behind me paid for my shopping or a friend invited me round their house when I couldn’t afford my heating bill. Please get in touch if you need a helping hand.

The blasts in Beirut  were pretty devastating  but the important news in all this was that more than 6 000 people were injured  plus 150 killed  dozens still missing to this hour as rescue teams search for them  & hundreds of homes & people’s livelihoods were shattered  rendering nearly 3000 homeless.     As a result  Beirut has been declared a disaster striken city.     With the port -- Lebanon's economical lifeline -- totally destroyed   food shortages will spike & many families will go without.Already  Lebanon was suffering from massive food & fuel shortages  and now it will not be able to import anything. Bleak  darker days for hundreds of thousands of people lie ahead!     This is urgent.     Lebanon needs you now.    Please donate so we can ensure people have a place to stay safe  food to eat & the means to survive & overcome this catastrophe.    Pray for lebanon ...    Your help is more needed than ever     Your donations will help contribute to:    -hospital bills  -small repairs  -Buy basic food items to put together food parcels for many who will have nothing to eat today and in many more days to come.   -Life saving medications for those in need & unable to afford those.We need to help those on the ground with whatever means we can.    Help us help people   we beg you!         ___________________________________      Half the population are living in abject poverty.     People are dying  not from Covid  but from starvation  lack of medication and healthcare.    The economy  currency and banking system have failed. Inflation has been the final blow. Many in work have not been paid for months and others have lost their job and cannot feed their families or pay the rent.     Callers from across Lebanon have been begging for help on the programme “Sahtak Bill Dinyeh ” (your health is worth the world) on Sawt al Ghad radio .    Helped by many charitable people  the programme’s host Dory Nasr has distributed food  medicine and basic necessities.        Now the warehouse is empty.      Lebanese around the world and those sympathetic to the country’s plight can help by donating what they can. Every penny helps  paying for baby milk  food  medicine and housing.    Hala and Dana  two British-Lebanese expats  decided to kickstart this fundraiser to help secure both continuity and replenishment of the food bank. This is a much needed lifeline  without which many families will be doomed with both hunger and displacement.       Le Liban est au bord de l’effondrement total.    La moitié de la population vit dans une pauvreté extrême.    Les gens meurent  non pas de Covid  mais de faim  de manque de médicaments et de soins de santé.    L'économie  la monnaie et le système bancaire ont échoué. L'inflation a été le coup de grâce. Beaucoup d’employés n'ont pas reçu leurs salaires depuis des mois et d'autres ont perdu leur emploi et ne peuvent plus nourrir leurs familles  payer le loyer ou acheter des medicaments vitaux.    Les appelants de part et d’autre du Liban ont imploré l'aide sur l'émission «Sahtak Bill Dinyeh» (votre santé vaut le monde) sur la radio Sawt al Ghad .    Avec l’aide de nombreuses personnes charitables  l’animateur du programme  Dori Nasr  a distribué de la nourriture  des médicaments et des produits de première nécessité.    Maintenant  l'entrepôt est vide.    Les Libanais au monde entier et les sympathisants du sort du pays peuvent aider en donnant ce qu’ils peuvent. Chaque centime aide à payer pour le lait infantile  la nourriture  les médicaments et le logement. ",False

With it being a tough few months for everyone stuck in lockdown  as the restrictions ease we are looking to get back to netball as soon as possible.    Many of the opportunities where we would fundraise for our netball club such as presentation night  quiz nights etc were cancelled therefore we are looking at a different approach to raise some funds this year which will benefit our club. We aim to run/cycle/walk 100 miles in October and to allow all members of our club to participate the younger players have been put into teams to complete this with one another. This will encourage team work to get the miles complete as well as a bit of fitness which we all love since we have not had any pre-season! Our older players will either work in teams of 2 or complete the 100 miles as an individual to really set the challenge! Not only will our club benefit from the fundraising but we have chosen 2 charities that we feel would really benefit from this too: Inverclyde Food Bank and Talk on Inverclyde    Both of which are very important during these hard times and we are working together to help a little where we can. 60% of the funds raised will go to the Clyde Netball Club and 20% each to the above charities.    Any donations would be greatly appreciated and we will keep you updated on our journey through the Clyde Netball Facebook page!",False

If I manage to hit £1000 in donations by July 1st  I will shave my head and split the donations between two charities. During lockdown I've been volunteering and helping deliver shopping to the vulnerable  in doing this I've noticed that food banks have been running low on food and supplies and so I want to donate some of the money to my local food banks.

Naturally occurring sugar is fine but no foods with added sugar in are allowed. The list is long.. the obvious such as chocolate  sweets  biscuits  cakes but also white bread  tomato ketchup (a staple in our house)  most crisps... the list is endless.     We have been fortunate enough to have financially managed through the pandemic but know so many people who are relying on food banks to feed their families. Therefore we are getting sponsorship for our two local food banks (Okehampton and Exeter); we will do a massive food shop and share the food between them!!    Every donation big or small helps encourage the boys to their goal and it is hopefully going to make a dent on my waistline!!!",False

GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw Since We Care was launched as the UK's largest independent food bank and advice and support hub in Lewisham in 2014  we have always ensured that  during school holidays and Christmas  children and the hungry families they come from do not have to worry about putting food on the table. This half term  however  and over this coming Christmas  we truly need your help to feed the new wave of people and pets from across London who are in crisis and will be coming through our doors this winter at Kath's Place  50 Friendly Street  Deptford SE8 4DR.    Can you imagine losing up to 40% of your monthly income? That is the reality for so many people in the present crisis. Rents are so high in our area that people in work do not have enough cash to pay the rent and  probably for the first time in their lives  are having to trade a visit to their local coffee shop for a visit to the We Care Food Bank and Food Pantry for help  advice  support and solidarity. Embarrased and even ashamed  but even more desperate and distraught that their kids are going hungry  mums tell us that they can go days without food  and  on average  it takes people at least a week of going hungry before they finally come through our doors and ask for help. We really do need your donation this Christmas GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw . Becasue we help everyone and anyone and do not focus on one particular group (such as refugees or the homeless) we get absolutely NO national or local government funding or any other type of funding. Anyone and everyone in crisis is welcome at We Care  #homeless #refugees #elderly #temporayhousing #lgbtq #bame #disabled #selfemployed #endchildfoodpoverty.

50","Raising money for frontline nhs staff for food  accommodation and whatever else needed  and putting back into the community for food banks for families unable to work So lockdown is now upon us all so I thought of a way of raising money for nhs frontline staff and foodbanks for families unable to work  And a way to keep people smiling  So..... nominate a friend to shave there hair ( it’ll grow back by the time we’re out of this sh#t ) They name there price  Check the link to see if they’ve donated And shave it !!!!! Please copy and share and let’s see how much we can raise for this much needed cause and have a barrel of laughs along the way. Before and after pics will make it so much funnier ",False

50","The world is experiencing an unprecedented challenge. It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has launched to support our community and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.    The Lambeth Food Bank Fund     Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.    In Lambeth we have a history of looking after one another - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.     So we are creating something called the Lambeth Food Bank Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.     Our borough has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has been set up for us to help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.     Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Lambeth. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.      * * *    FAQs    What can I do?    Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the most vulnerable.     Where will the funds go?    The funds will go to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by Holy Trinity Clapham and delivered to food banks across the borough - including Brixton & Norwood  Clapham Park  Vauxhall  and Waterloo - that can help the most vulnerable.     If I do donate will it go to those who need it?     Yes  your donation will go to those who need it. Unlike other platforms  GoFundMe do not charge a fundraising fee although they take a small transaction fee. See here for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to.     I want to help my local community  will this money be spent in Lambeth?     Yes.     Where can I find accurate information about covid-19?     For general information on CV-19  please visit the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response    Lambeth Council have some useful information: https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/elections-and-council/about-lambeth/coronavirus-covid-19-information    If you are worried about your own health  call the NHS on 111.",False

Roes Senior men's team have decided to raise funds for local organisations during the current Covid-19 situation.    Our aim is to have each team member run 5km around Moorlough at staggered set times to adhere to social distancing guidelines from sun rise to sun set on Saturday 2nd May. We hope to run 200km collectively throughout the entire day.    The run will begin at 6am with the first man running the course with the last run scheduled for sunset at around 9pm.    Our Club man Cathal McShane has kindly donated a number of prizes for a raffle. Prizes include:    1) His All Ireland Final jersey from 2018 vs Dublin  2) The boots he wore on the day  3) The Boots he wore vs Meath in which he kicked the equalising point to take it to extra time.    Details of this can be found on Cathal's social media pages and the club social media pages.    We have also received some further generous donations of prizes for the raffle.    James ' The Strabanimal' Gallagher has kindly donated a signed pair of MMA gloves worn at his last fight.    Ronan McNamee (Aghyaran &Tyrone) has kindly donated a Signed Jersey.    Peak Performance Gym Strabane- 1 years Gym Membership      The chosen organisations to which we will be donating to are as follows:    -Strabane Food Bank  -Aware in Strabane  -Dennett interchange meals on wheels  -COVID wards Altnagelvin  -Speech and Language Therapy ICU Altnagelvin    We hope to raise as much money as we possibly can for those in need during this time.

Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland.

However  we have seen that our current government has voted against this which is awful. We know that being hungry will affect children’s ability to concentrate in school  their sleep  their behaviour and their mental health.    Please give a fiver and if you are unable to do that  please donate some money to your local food bank or start a fundraiser yourselves!     All funds raised will be split between FareShare and Place2Be. We know it is a difficult time at the moment but let’s do this for the children in our country.    Many thanks     Jamie and Zoë",False

I heard about how Marcus Rashford has been trying to get free school meals for kids during half term and thought that maybe I could help too. My dad told me that since there has been no fans allowed into the stadiums for a while the food banks have lost out on lots of donations. So if we can't donate at professional level why don't we do it at grassroots level? My football club  Knowsley South FC  have given me their full support from reception age all the way up to the grown ups. We're organised collections at our football matches  a donation point locally and have arranged collections from people who are can't get out to the shops or drop off points. I've already got some lovely food donations and have got lots more to come! Because lots of people are are having to Isolate my mum and dad have set up a Go Fund Me Page for anybody who wants to help but can't donate food. Money can then go straight to the food banks. No kids should have to got to bed with a sore tummy because it's empty. If you can  please donate anything you have spare. As little as £1 can fill somebody's tummy. Thanks ⚽",False

Pema is now 10 months old  when she was born  the mother texted me from the hospital saying she’s giving her up for adoption without consulting me.  I then went through social service and claimed her back. During the parental assessment I brought up an issue that I’m on zero hour contract teaching violin for local council music program and covid 19 means all of my concerts and gigs are cancelled.  The social workers have been reassuring me that I will get help from the government  but the financial support is based on calculations and seems to ignore the fact that I have no income when there’s no school.   I’m quite desperate now because all the schools are in the settling period meaning they won’t start music or instrumental lessons until October.   I always get paid for September at the   end of October. With no work in September  there is no pay in October. Works I do in October will pay at the end of November. It’s only mid September and I can’tsurvive until the end of November.  In October I will have to start taking my daughter to child minder  and I have to payahead. I just can’t hold out that long. And I have a lot of debt also since lockdown started(from friends and credit card) I am staying at the homeless hostel room so we are ok for accommodation now but universal credit won’t pay me this month because I received self employed grant in August but that’s only £500.  I will be super grateful if you can help.   I also have been visiting food bank and soif you can contribute to nappy and formula cost  that will be great.  best wishes   Andy ",False

Every week we take the money you have kindly donated to a cash and carry and buy  in bulk  what the four food banks we are working with have told us they desperately need. (See pics below). This is complemented by a weekly visit to the Felix Project where we load up with fresh fruit  veg  meat  eggs and cheese. All of this is delivered to community kitchens who cook up meals for those most in need in W10.    We are currently working with The Dalgarno Trust   Bay 20   The Space and The Tabernacle . All four of these charities provide meals  bags of shopping and many other support services to those experiencing food poverty in W10. Kensington and Chelsea boasts some of the highest net worth inhabitants but also has many pockets of severe deprivation – North Kensington is one of the deepest. A sobering fact to note is that 31.6% of children in this borough live in poverty.    Food banks we are working alongside unanimously concur that the demand for aid has tripled this year since the pandemic began. Help is needed more than ever. Every time we make a drop  the relief and joy the charities express is palpable and sums up how desperate the situation is.    All the money donated will be used to supply fruit  veg and essentials to those in need in North Kensington. Your financial donations will go entirely towards funding this food relief project. All staff  including Rima  Amanda  Maryam and the admin  safeguarding and marketing support team are volunteers.     Please share this page with anyone who might be interested in helping and please donate if you would like to help. A regular donation would make a huge difference  as food poverty is not going to go away.    Thank you for your invaluable support.    Rima  Maryam  Amanda and team.    How to contact us:  Email: [email redacted]  Instagram: stjohnscafe    Call Rima: 07891 078 647    Or Amanda 07956 282 858    How it started: In March when the pandemic closed the doors of Rima’s Café at the Playground Theatre  she and her son Mars created a GoFundMe page to raise money for a Covid19 food relief campaign. Over the course of 11 weeks  they raised £16 000. With the help of a team of local volunteers producing over 6000 meals  all of which were delivered to those most in need in the North Ken community.

We are using our 3D printers to produce face shields  which we are distributing to local health-care workers  nurses  care homes  pharmacists  and others who need them. The demand has been overwhelming  as has the offers of help. These workers are putting their health and even their lives at risk in order to keep South Queensferry healthy  so we are doing what we can to support them with 3D printing technology.     We are currently running three printers. The masks take just under an hour each to print. So we are trying to raise funds in order to purchase a fourth printer  (likely an Ender 3  or a CR-10)  which will enable us to make far more masks  and help far more people.     The money will also be used to buy supplies as needed  more PVC sheets  more filament  or more elastics. We will also support anyone else in the community who has a printer  and wants to join our team.     Once this crisis has passed  and it *will* pass  we will be donating the printer and any left over supplies to the local high school. There it will be used to teach a new generation on how to use this technology  so that next crisis we will be even more prepared to help. Any leftover money will be donated to the food bank.     3D printing has  all around the world  proven to be vital during this epidemic. There are ER rooms in Spain  midwives in the Philippines  nurses in Sweden  all using 3D printed face shields  when no other protection is available.

It is more important than ever that we work together to support one another. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund has launched to provide support to those most at need in our community. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund Right now many of us are understandably feeling anxious and vulnerable  but there are many among us that need immediate support in order to ensure that they can have access to food. Greenwich residents have a proud history of looking after one another - and never has this been more important than now. So I have been working with Greenwich Food Bank to create the Greenwich Food Bank Fund. As the borough faces one of its most important challenges in living memory  the Fund has been set up to ensure that those in need across the borough have access to the help they need. Please  even during this most difficult of times  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Greenwich. Please be assured that even the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference. Thank you for your generosity. FAQs Where will the funds go? The funds will go directly to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by the Greenwich Food Bank and delivered to food banks across the borough  from Blackheath to Eltham  Kidbrooke  Thamesmead and beyond. A full list of food bank locations is available at https://greenwich.foodbank.org.uk/locations/. If I donate will it go directly to those who need it? Yes  your donation will go directly to Greenwich Food Bank. Unlike some other platforms  GoFundMe does not charge a fundraising fee although it takes a small transaction fee. See https://www.gofundme.com/c/free-fundraising for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to. Will the money be spent in Greenwich? Yes. Is there anything else I can do? The most immediate need is to raise finance  so that purchasing can continue. However there is also a need to: (1) donate food where possible; and (2) create a team of delivery drivers as the Food Bank moves to a delivery model. If you are able to help with either of these  please email [email redacted].uk. Where can I find more information about Covid-19? For general information on CV-19  please visit the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response or the NHS at https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/.

We decided to start fundraising for the charity Little Miracles. Over the next 2 weeks we are going to be supporting the charity by buying food for there food bank  buying toys for there centres and help do any needed renovations to allow them to re open as soon as possible. This is only going to be possible by raising money. So we have decided to as a group run a joint marathon.  Update:  Due to the news released about lockdown this is unfortunately not going to be possible. Instead over 3 days every person in our team is going to run a Marathon (12 marathons in total). Then we are going to donate all raised money to little miracles so they can spend it on areas needing funding. ",False

The Club itself is considering a number of online fundraising ideas and as a Member of 10 years plus (as well as being a Member some 20 years ago) I thought to myself what can I do to help ?     All Rotary Clubs are a part of an International grouping of volunteers who give up some of their time to raise funds for and take part in projects designed to help and assist the local communities and internationally.    Bodmin in Cornwall is a charming (former) market town with an active (but ageing !} Rotary Club of 27 Members who raise funds and  in normal times  participate in numerous activities. These are many and varied and include supporting the local food bank and memory cafe as well as assisting young people both educationally and in social development. The Club also supports local fundraising activities of charities such as MNDA  Hospital League of Friends as well as supporting Shelterbox. Internationally numerous other activities have recently included the refurbishment and delivery of a fire appliance to a remote settlement in Albania.    As one clearly in the old fool category I'm not fit enough to run up and down stairs a million times or unaware enough to scoff 200 pancakes in one go (possibly not even a tempting thought) so I looked for a way to help the Club within my capabilities. I live in Bodmin with my wife Carol and have for the last 40 years or so (with the exception of a few days) sported a beard. Since lockdown the relatively manicured hair has grown into a luxuriant beard of which I am quite proud and I thought I could possibly with your help raise some funds for the Rotary Club by having it removed...    My wife is not so keen as she has persistently maintained I would have a facial similarity to a Chipmunk without it ! Hey ho....being of a repressed devil may care personality I thought I'd be a brave Chipmunk and have a sponsored beard shave with all proceeds going to Bodmin Rotary and I'm hoping to raise at least £250 (or as much as possible) to part with Santas pride and joy…....    I feel passionately that local community volunteer organisations are increasingly important in this changing and challenging world and I hope you will feel able to support me in my effort.    I intend to be 'de-Santa' on 5th August and would welcome your sponsorship if only to be able to witness how like a Chipmunk I really am!    All funds raised will go directly to Bodmin Rotary Club    Many thanks    Bruce Tyzzer",False

Diaspora are coming together to raise funds to rebuild Lebanon's capital Beirut and support all impacted communities.    We are asking you to help us  by donating what you can to this crowdfund  and joining us on 22 August for an evening of pride  performance and love for Beirut  its people and its reconstruction. Rebuilding Beirut with Pride will be hosted at the Bell Pub in Whitechapel  and live-streamed all night for everyone to watch and take part in. From an art auction to a programme of performance  we want to celebrate Arab and queer art and talent and help rebuild our hometown in the process. Click here to buy your tickets for the event.    Where is the money going?    All proceeds will be equally split and donated to the Lebanese Red Cross  Beit El Baraka   Basmeh & Zeitooneh and Embrace Lebanon   as well as two grassroots LGBT+ crowdfunds  detailed below.     Beit El Baraka provide food banks for victims of the disaster  Basmeh & Zeitooneh are responding on the ground to those who have been made homeless  and Embrace Lebanon offers mental health support.     The NGOs were chosen after having direct discussions with several people within Lebanon itself who informed us of which organisations are trustworthy and are not affiliated with government authorities in any way  to ensure the money is directly going to support those in need first and foremost.    We have also identified two crowdfunds that have been strongly recommended to us by many members of Beirut's LGBTQ+ community  in that they are offering on-the-ground and direct support and are being led by trusted community members.     These crowdfunds are Disaster Relief for Lebanese Transgender Community   led by Lebanese trans pioneer Sasha Elijah  and Funds for LGBTQ Victims of Beirut Explosion   led by prominent community member Sandra Melhem.    The total sum raised will be split 6-way between these 6 beneficiaries  and receipts of these donations will be posted here for completely transparency.     Why are we fundraising?     Beirut is a disaster zone. On the 4th of August  the city was rocked by a colossal explosion involving 2 750 tons of ammonium nitrate. To put things in perspective  it is one of the worse urban explosions since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The blast killed at least 157 people and injured 5 000. Hundreds remain missing. With the force of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake  the explosion's shock wave enveloped Beirut  shattering windows and collapsing old buildings. Lebanon's hospitals - already overrun by coronavirus - are in dire need of support. Meanwhile  around 300 000 people have been displaced from their homes. Two of Beirut's LGBTQ+ hubs  Mar Mikhael and Gemmayze  were only 500m away from the point of detonation. These areas have been utterly devastated and  like many other parts of Beirut  are now uninhabitable.    The blast comes at the worse time for Lebanon  hitting a country already in disaster. Covid-19 exacerbated a pre-existing political and economic crisis  bringing the Lebanese to the brink of collapse. This year has seen thousands of Lebanese lose their lifetime savings and the country's hyper-inflated currency remains in free-fall. One in the three people are unemployed  while amongst Lebanon's poorest  famine is approaching. In short  your donations are needed. They will support those people immediately impacted by the explosion  but also Lebanese communities and families facing economic desolation. Please see below for which NGOs and groups we are donating to.    What's happening on the 22nd?     While we encourage you support us  share this page and ask all your friends to donate throughout the next two weeks  we have an exciting day planned to drum up even more donations! On 22 August there are two events you need to know about:    6:30PM: Art Auction (online)     We will be auctioning a collection of both Arab and Queer art  prints and designs  kindly donated by artists and designers from both the UK and Lebanon. More details to come  including some sneak peaks at some of the pieces! All proceeds will be added to the goal target. This will be an online auction so everyone can take part!     Interested? Put in your details here to keep up to date with the auction so you don't miss out on any information!     Are you an artist who would like to donate a piece to be included in the auction? Let us know here!    8:00PM: Performances (In person & live streamed)    Rebuilding Beirut with Pride will be hosted at the Bell Pub in Whitechapel  and live-streamed all night for everyone to watch. We have a line up of performers showcasing Arab and Queer talent with opportunities and activities to donate to the fund throughout the night. A full programme of the night will be released shortly.     We only have a limited number of 30 tickets for the in-person event and will be following strict social distancing measures  including table service and contactless payment.     But don't worry! We have 500 tickets available for our online live stream  where you can take part in the night.     Click here to buy your tickets for the event .       Who are we?     We are a group of Lebanese expats  friends  allies and activists who want to help however we can in rebuilding our home. We each work in different sectors (NGOs  journalism  fashion  music) and want to bring our passions  networks and resources together to help make real change back home.",False

Now is a time to come together and help support members in our society that need it. With this in mind  we wanted to make our own contribution in tackling the repercussions of this devastating virus.     We (Amy Turner) and (Angharad James) are both professional footballers at Manchester United and Reading respectively. On Friday 1st May 2020  we will be completing a ‘stay at home bike challenge’ that will consist of cycling the distance from Sheffield (Amy’s hometown) to Pembrokeshire (Angharad’s hometown) in less than 24 hours.    Together this will be a total of 383km. We are not expert cyclists by any means and probably don’t know what we are letting ourselves in for but we are determined to help make a difference. In the absence of fixtures at the moment  we will be completing 90-minute relays each throughout the ride to replicate the duration of matches      We are hoping to raise a significant amount of money for two charities in Sheffield; IDAS (Independent Domestic Abuse Services) and The Hub Food Bank. And two charities from Pembrokeshire; GTBAL (Get the boys a lift) and Cardigan Food Bank.     IDAS is a specialist charity in Yorkshire supporting anyone who has experience of or is affected by domestic abuse and/or sexual violence. The Hub Food Bank and Cardigan Food Bank supply urgent food for families in crisis. GTBAL is a community-based charity that supports those dealing with mental health issues.    All four charities are organisations that are very close to our hearts and are in need of support in these difficult times. All contributions made will make a huge difference and will go a long way in helping lots of people in our hometowns and surrounding areas.     We would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for your donations  and TOGETHER we can help tackle this.",False

At around 1.15pm on Monday 27th April  Peter was robbed of £2 500 cash in Lidl car park  after leaving the Halifax Bank in Denton. The money was earmarked to purchase a replacement car to enable him to continue with his voluntary work which  during the current COVID-19 pandemic  includes collecting food & medical packages from local residents for distribution to vulnerable members of the community from the food bank in Haughton Green.    The crime was witnessed by several shoppers  and also caught on CCTV. The Police have been informed.     Peter also transports people to & from their appointments at Tameside General Hospital. Away from volunteering & entertaining  he is a a regular visitor to Denton St Lawrence Cricket Club  both to watch the cricket and attend social events at the Club. So  in one way or another  he is a familiar face in the local area.

But stocks are running low  and the foundation urgently needs basic food items such as cereal  pasta  pasta sauce  soup  beans  tinned vegetables  fruit  biscuits  rice  eggs  sugar  tea bags  coffee and milk to continue offering support.    Elias Mattu Foundation had been helped by Lakshmi Sweet Centre Restaurant in Blakenhall  for hot meal on a daily base but needed others to come forward.    Some of the people we are helping are on benefits  and are elderly and vulnerable. A lot of them can't get out of the house because they are self-isolating and have no one else to do the shopping for them.    We are desperate to keep on supporting them but we need food donations.    For more information visit the Elias Mattu Foundation's Facebook page  or call Asha Mattu on 07[phone redacted]30.    Food items can be dropped off at a number of 6 Milford Road  Blakenhall  Wolverhampton  WV2 4NG.",False

We're raising money in aid of THE FRIENDS OF THE CHELSEA AND WESTMINSTER HOSPITAL and every donation will help. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to us.       OUR PROJECT IS TO FEED THE NIGHT SHIFT STAFF ON ITU WARDS    WHO WE ARE     We are Joe and Annabelle Colairo and  together with our family  we run a Cafe and Outside Catering company called Masters on Blackfriars Road  London. This is now closed  except for the kitchens  but check us out @ www.masterscatering.co.uk& on instagram @ masterscatering_london      THE PROBLEM      A consultant at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital told us that ""frontline staff were having a terrible and stressful time  working 12-14 hour shifts with no food available to them. The canteens are closed at night. The frontline staff  many of whom live alone  some of whom have to go to food banks  are exhausted after their long shifts "".          (Quotes from Alison Hulme’s texts - she is the Consultant paediatric surgeon who alerted us to this problem.)        “The IT Nurses are most at risk - poor things. I think they are having a gruelling time and so shopping and cooking is just too much for them when they are so low  both physically and emotionally”      “There is no time during shifts for a break  but a meal before or after would be hugely appreciated.”        THE SOLUTION      We specialise in supplying freshly cooked  nutritious and delicious meals. Joe is up at 4 in the morning  sourcing the best produce in New Covent Garden Market.      Since the 28th March  our chefs Sergio  Luis & Cesar have generously and freely volunteered to provide between 40 and 60 hot meals to frontline staff at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and The Royal London Hospital  Mile End.        WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP      Unfortunately we can’t sustain the cost of the food and packaging on our own any longer  and that’s why we need you.      You can be sure that your gift is well spent and it reaches the people most at risk and need.      * We are working on a NOT-FOR-PROFIT basis  * We have all the health  safety and 5* Hygiene certificates  * We know our nutritious meals will help keep the nurses healthier  * We know they will go directly to the nurses who need them most  those on the frontline  * Delivery is arranged by The Chelsham Road Community Association  who have Alison Hulme  a consultant paediatric surgeon  making sure it is delivered directly to the now expanded ITU unit. It goes in at 9pm.  * They also deliver treats  vitamin shots  fresh fruit and also much needed Organic Juice from PIPORGANIC.COM which is being supplied totally for free. The PPE kit is like wearing a plastic bag and dehydration is a problem for the nurses wearing it  * There are no middle men or large corporations taking a cut as with some other organisations  * The cost per meal is £3.50       PLEASE DONATE AND HELP US TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE CARING FOR US      In our experience  there are many donations for frontline staff working during the day  but not for those working at night. Where there are donations of food to the night shift staff  they never make it to them; and that's why we need your help.      “ Someone delivered 15 Pizzas 2 days ago and left them at reception. By the time they got to ITU there were only 2! “      WE KNOW OUR MEALS GET DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO ITU. ( By volunteers every night from Chelsham Road)      Here are some testimonials….      “Every day for the past 2 weeks I have collected 40 delicious wholesome  freshly cooked meals  half of which are vegetarian. The offering is wholeheartedly generous  inventive  varied  nutritious and of great quality.   I met one nurse leaving a 14 hour day shift  who had had some of Joe and Annabelle's meals when she was on night duty. She said “ Oh my goodness  I can’t tell you what a lifeline this is. Who are these people who are so amazing? It means so much to us - it makes me want to cry . I’ve been working all day and only finishing now at 9pm means I haven’t been able to eat all day. It’s like a war zone in there. Thank you  thank you  thank you. This is just what we need.” - Janie from Chelsham Road    ""ITU and theatre nurses are very grateful"" - Ben  Consultant     One of the nurses said they were anxious about getting ill and that its a very worrying time for them. They said the food is amazing and it gives them something to look forward to after a tough shift.      * The cost per meal is £3.50. We deliver 7 days a week which is 280 meals each week to Chelsea and we are looking to raise £980 amount per week.   We have the capacity to deliver more meals to different frontline staff in other hospitals if we have the funds and only if we have the direct access with the frontline staff and operating theatre night managers. Your money will go towards meals for those that need it most.       Thank you so much for making this possible.      Yours faithfully    Joe and Annabelle",False

This year has hit everyone hard. So many families  couples and single people are not looking forward to an enjoyable Christmas. Thankfully  with the help of the Cleckheaton Food Bank  Christmas will hopefully be a nicer time for them. I recently set up the Cleckheaton Virtual Christmas Market 2020 on Facebook after the real market had to be cancelled. This is to allow local businesses to showcase their goods  and so shoppers had one easy place to find what they were looking for. I’m not usually involved in the Christmas Market  but I do know their event each year raised funds for the town’s beautiful Christmas lights. With all this in mind  I have set up this GoFundMe to raise funds for both the food bank and the Christmas lights fund  so the stallholders and shopper in the group  and whoever else who wants to  can donate to these great causes. I know times are hard  but even £1 helps!! Please give what you can  and thank you everyone for getting involved. Merry Christmas ❤️",False

Virus Covid-19 our family feel really strongly about supporting those who are less able  less fortunate and are alone at this time.    We have decided to come together as a family and put together care packages which we will distribute out and deliver to those in need. We know there are thousands of people who could really benefit from this so whilst we are fundraising to purchase the goods to make the packages we are also asking households to donate goods too. This could be anything from frozen meals  toilet rolls  tins and non perishable goods.    We are also supporting all the incredible staff at the NHS across London  we’ve provided them fresh cooked meals and supplying drinks and snacks during their long shifts plus some hospitals have set up internal food banks for the staff to be able to take home essential items for their families. Anything you can do to help would be really appreciated.    Be Safe and wash your hands!    Best Wishes    Corona Care Challenge",False

Since we were founded 10 months ago  we have continued to support local schools and their families with vital food packages. This is something that is really important to us as we have come to realise how many people are struggling in the county and have been shocked by it. We have built a fantastic relationship with local schools and knowing we are doing something for these young people and their families is very rewarding. As well as schools we have provided food packages to the Northamptonshire community mental health team  'leaving care': an organisation for individuals who are leaving the care system  HM probation services  local community groups as well as many families or vulnerable individuals who have reached out for support.     The McCarthy-Dixon foundation started initially as an emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a food bank and food delivery service.

When we were little  growing up in the 90’s  my siblings and I had free school meals  through middle school and high school  and I know how thankful my mum was of these free lunches. We had very little money This was back in the day where very little money meant just that. We didn’t have SKY TV  or mobile phone bills and my mum would go without food so that we could have new clothes and didn’t get bullied at school. These were the days when the supermarkets had a price war on tins of their own brand baked beans Anyone remember that? When they went so low  that at one point they were 1p! Yes 1p! And my mum would take me and my siblings and we would go in separately and purchase 6 tins each (the maximum you were allowed to buy) for a penny each. Because baked beans could really fill out any meal  and was the cheapest thing to buy. I still remember this to this day. ☺️          Some might say  if you can’t afford to feed your kids  then why have them? But right now there are so many families who  6 months ago were absolutely fine. And we know this first hand through work that Aron is involved with alongside the shop. We know that there are families  who have lost their jobs and can’t find a new one. Or families that haven’t had any help from the government through this whole Covid situation. There are families now using food banks because they don’t have enough money to go shopping. This is not a child’s fault. No-one chose for this year to pan out the way it did. And as such we want to help.           Each year  normally at Christmas we do something for the local food banks or food charities. Although this year  our business has been hit super hard with the huge number of postponements of weddings  and the uncertainty of peoples buying habits  we know that our children won’t go hungry this half term. And so we want to give back.           We know we’re a little late  but really it’s never to late to help. We want to donate 15 food parcels  including food for lunches this week as well as some essential foods  to families who are really struggling. So...          If you know a family that are visiting food banks.     If you’re a family that don’t know how you’re going to feed your kids this holiday.     If you’re a teacher who knows of a family who needs a little help          Then please message us privately to arrange collection of a small food parcel. There will be no judgement from anyone here. Parcels will be ready to collect this Monday & Tuesday between 10-4 at the shop.           As much as we’d like to help as many people as we can  unfortunately we need to keep this local  to families in Poole and Bournemouth.           No child should go to bed hungry     Each food parcel will be worth £15  but what ever you can donate will help       (If you’re a business who wants to help and donate any parcels  please message us privately)",False

Research conducted by several scientific institutions is showing that a significant number of people affected by COVID-19 go on to have symptoms for months after their initial illness. Most of us are young  previously healthy individuals who  by the official definition  initially suffered a “mild” form of the disease. Yet  months later  most of us are unable to return to work and to function at the level we were previously functioning at before falling ill.    This is beginning to attract the attention of the media  with articles being published in The Guardian  The Independent  the BBC  the Atlantic  and almost every major news provider. Despite that  the U.K. Government has so far failed to acknowledge our existence and to provide us with the medical attention and treatment we need  as is being done in other countries. We have therefore decided to launch a campaign to raise public awareness of our ongoing plight. The money we gather will be used to fund three different projects.    1.) Open letter: We plan to write an open letter signed by as many of us as possible that will be sent to decision makers  key figures  and officials in the U.K. government and the Healthcare sector to raise awareness of what we’re going through.    2.) Short Film: We are planning to produce a short film that will highlight what we’re going through. The film will include pictures of fellow “Long Haulers” holding up personal messages.    3.) Message in a Bottle: We plan to deliver a number of messages written by fellow Long Haulers to the door of Number 10  Downing Street. The messages will detail the suffering each writer has endured and will each be individually packed in a test tube to emphasise how trapped and isolated we feel.

In a very short time  we set up a non-partisan volunteer network in the area and are coordinating alongside councillors  cabinet members  community leaders  emergency services and health professionals and also with the local authority to meet the needs of local people.     The following is a segment from BBC national news that covered some of our volunteers checking on residents in the L18 area.        It is still unknown how our community might be impacted by the crisis and how different services will be able to respond to resident's needs. We are constantly evolving what we do and our response to the community's needs. We are following the the guidance of local authorities  public health bodies  and medical professionals to ensure that any action we take is safe.        We need some financial support to cover basic expenses for administration and volunteers (web & email hosting  stationery  fuel  emergency food purchases for vulnerable people  telephone and SMS text services).    We have DBS checked volunteers in place as well as a safeguarding team and are tracking everything we do from start to finish. We are also working in partnership with South Liverpool Food Banks  who will use our volunteers for food parcel deliveries.    We have set up a dedicated bank account for the network and have appointed two auditors to oversee any financial transactions.    We currently have 236 volunteers.        Your generosity would be hugely appreciated by those elderly and vulnerable residents in and around our community that are frightened and depend on our support.    Thank you.

The masks are distributed ‘free of charge’ to residents  community agencies  key services  care homes  food banks  the medical profession and those most in need across the city Volunteers sew the face masks and help us source material  though donations by residents  which are recycled into masks. Recycling material allows us to help the environment and deliver mask free of charge. Since launching on 8th April 2020 we have made and distributed over 1 000 masks but the demand is increasing especially as more people are going out as we come out of lockout. Volunteers have covered any additional costs to run the project to the stage but now need to raise funds to continue and deliver the increasing demand for masks.

Her beloved husband and two children are left to try and pick up the pieces whilst dealing with the heartache and financial burden in the wicked wake of this disease.     Janet was the most caring and selfless woman  always putting the needs of others before her own. She suffered from an autoimmune disease and asthma but despite this  she wanted to give to the community and help as many people as she could. During the first lockdown  Janet reached out to the local area - hand-delivering letters introducing herself  giving her contact details  and reassuring people she was there for them whether this was for an ear to listen  or if they needed support with getting shopping or medical prescriptions; she was there for everyone and anyone.    She has always been such a generous  charitable  and kind natured person  supporting and caring for everyone who came into her life – it was in her nature.     Before lockdown she regularly held MacMillan  coffee mornings and worked for the local council - working with deprived areas in the community as well as working in schools  raising awareness for children in poverty. Janet also supported many other charities including food banks and Christmas appeals. She was an active member in her local church  where she will be dearly missed.    Janet's act of kindness did not stop there as  at the age of 52  she went into fostering. She fostered two boys who lost their grandfather during the lockdown. Again  not thinking of herself but the children that had lost their family. She fostered the boys until she sadly passed away.    This page has been created to help raise awareness of the devastating impact covid-19 has on families and to support her family with the financial costs involved in her passing. In this time of need  Janet’s husband is out of work as he usually works away. This is not something he is able to continue due to the support his children and grandchildren need right now.    Coronavirus really has had a devastatingly emotional and financial impact on her family – please stay at home and take heed of government guidelines  it really could save your life.",False

The plan is for my sister/mum to use this money to buy food supplies and donate them to the local food bank in Preston.     After the recent disgusting ruling by the UK Government about school meals  I wanted to try and do something for the local area I grew up in.

As more people become furloughed  lose their jobs and businesses close more and more families are being forced to live in poverty which is why we want to help as best we can.     Myself and my colleagues are going to spend a night sleeping on the streets in Enniskillen to help raise funds for this very worthy cause.

Update: 3rd March  2021    Another interview with The Independent  describing the struggle to survive on Universal Credit and my fears about the cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/budget/budget-universal-credit-20-pounds-b1811750.htmlTaking this opportunity to thank everyone for their ongoing support - you are wonderful and I couldn't do this without you.   .  .  .      Update: 19th January  2021 I've been interviewed by The Independent about the catastrophic consequences of the upcoming Universal Credit cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/b1789040.html      .  .  .        My original message: 30th August  2019    This is incredibly difficult for me to write  but I need to ask my friends  acquaintances and perhaps even some people whom I don’t know  to help me get through the next few months.    I am a domestic abusive survivor struggling to meet essential living costs and the situation is going to escalate rapidly because my employer is deducting more than 25% of my pay from September onwards  to recover two overpayments they made in error for a really long time  without me or payroll noticing.    I’m already on a low income and have been trying to find a more stable job. Until now I’ve been working two jobs  but the temporary one is coming to an end and I will only have my permanent part-time job – where they have persistently tried to dismiss me on health grounds so aside from the overpayment recovery  I just can’t hold on there for much longer.    Whenever I do give my notice or get dismissed  they’ll take the entirety of my final month’s pay.    I live alone but the person I used to cohabit with left substantial utility bill debts at our home that I didn’t become aware of until later  since they lied about having cleared balances. There’s not enough space to move another person in  and I can’t move out right now for financial and contractual reasons.    Because of an active police investigation for rape and domestic abuse that I can’t go into  I’ve already borrowed money for unexpected costs like home security  numerous phone calls to charities and agencies offering professional advice  and private therapy which unfortunately I had to quit.    My chronically poor health has dramatically worsened – I’ve been to a&e twice in the past fortnight because of a kidney infection that didn’t respond to treatment and I had to pawn things to pay for my ongoing prescriptions  but there’s not much of value left for me to sell.    I need to wear glasses but have been doing without for several months since they broke; I’m doing without a lot of things. One of my cats needs dental surgery soon but this isn’t going to be possible.    I earn slightly too much to claim benefits or get free prescriptions and despite years of hospital referrals  I am still fighting for a diagnosis to explain my physical health problems so I’m not currently eligible for any support that could be claimed.    Unfortunately I’m estranged from my parents and I don’t have regular contact with any other family.    I don’t have savings and I wouldn’t realistically be able to repay any further money borrowed.    Up to this point I’ve managed to keep on top of the rent and buy cat food but I have now begun going without my own food  even before overpayment recovery has started. I’m hoping to access a food bank next week but the period I can use them for will be limited.    It’s hard to put a figure on how much help I should ask for  since the only real solution is me finding a job where they’re not actively trying to dismiss me for my chronic health problems  but I am hopeful that if I can just get straight with the money I already owe and raise a couple of months’ living expenses to buy myself time whilst finding a better job  then I can make things work.    Thank you for reading this far; I am extremely grateful to anyone who can donate or share this page. I don’t have many followers and would really appreciate people making this fundraiser more visible. ",False

We are understandably gutted. Not only is Canned Laughter incredibly fun but all proceeds from ticket sales go directly to the local food bank in the area the gig is put on in and right now food banks need our support more than ever: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-51837892    All ticket holders will be offered refunds. But ideally we would still like to raise the money we would have made in ticket sales from these two gigs to help the two food banks they would have supported.    We have set our target amount roughly at 80% of all available tickets sold to both events which would have been £2 560. We will split any money raised from this drive between Eat or Heat  The Waltham Forest Food Bank (Canned Laughter - April 25th) and Euston Food Bank (Canned Laughter: Karaoke Roulette - April 4th)    We thank you so much for your support.

To summarize  I lost my Dad to Leukemia 4 years ago and a year later my Mom was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer. I quit my job to care for her fulltime and she died in my arms 11 months later. What an honour and privilege it was to comfort my best friend as she took her final breath. I miss her every day with a constant ache in my heart.    A few months later  my 20 year marriage ended in divorce and so  my 3 sons and myself decided to leave Cape Town and move to the UK. We LOVE it here. The beauty of the English countryside brings so much peace  tranquility and serenity to my soul.    In February last year  I was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer and my operation at Lister Hospital was the day before lockdown began. After 10 months of chemotherapy  radiation and bone infusions  I am cancer free for now  but need to continue treatment and deal with the lingering side effects.    I lost my job at the end of July due to the effects of COVID-19 on the business  and because I have had to isolate with the cancer treatment  have been unable to find alternative employment. Until now that is. Whoop whoop. I have an amazing job offer which is secure  but I can only start once lockdown is lifted and the company is working back at the premises around mid to late February.    As I am here on an Ancestral Visa I have no recourse to public funds and McMillans  other charities and food banks are helping as much as they can. I have survived these 6 months through my savings and the donations and kindness of so many on my previous GoFundMe account.    My last hurdle is the next month and not being able to pay my rent or other monthly expenses and this is where I am appealing once again to your caring  generous and compassionate souls.    It is so hard to have to keep asking and I have had to learn a lot about my pride. Giving is so much easier than receiving. I just want to be able to provide for my boys  work hard as we South African woman do and have some degree of stability after a really challenging year. I pray that soon I will be able to give back and love those around me in the same way that you have loved and cared for myself and my boys.    Original appeal: (August 2020)    My name is Cara Rayner and I came to live in the UK with my boys just under a year ago. I was diagnosed with advanced stage breast cancer which had spread to the lymph nodes in February of this year. My surgery was a day before lockdown began and 8 weeks later  the chemotherapy sessions started  which will be followed by radiation therapy. The chemotherapy has been aggressive and relentless  but a Mama will do anything for her children  so I am fighting with everything in me.    Unfortunately  due to COVID-19  the company I worked at could no longer keep me on  so my employment ended at the end of July 2020. I am still shielding and have another two months of treatment left. Although I can interview for positions  I cannot work until November. As a single Mom  my savings are very low and I need to cover rent  monthly accounts and food for myself  but more importantly  my boys. As I am here on an Ancestral Visa  I do not have recourse to public funds. The NHS and McMillans Cancer Centre have been brilliant with their care  compassion and in helping me find solutions to the various problems experienced with cancer.    I lost my Dad to leukemia 4 years ago and my Mom to colon cancer 2 years ago. This was followed 6 months later by my divorce after a 20 year long marriage. All this prompted our move to the UK for a fresh start and exciting opportunities. I am humbly requesting assistance to get through the next few months with a focus on healing and being able to provide for my family. I am in love with the UK. The ever changing countryside brings me great peace and contentment. My faith in God is strong and He has always come through for me on every front.    Update (September 2020):I am completely humbled and blessed and honoured and overwhelmed by all this support. I did post an update on Facebook about my last chemo session for now. Thank you so much for helping me and my boys and for giving me a sense of peace about the next two months. We have a roof over our head and food and my bills could get paid.

I would like to try and raise £100 for my local food bank. When I was shopping with my mum we noticed that the food bank box by the door in the supermarket only had a few things in it and it made me feel sad. I told my mum I wanted to help get some food for babies children and families who need it  so we thought I could do a virtual bike ride from my house all the way to Chester Zoo and ask people to sponsor me. It is a long way from my house. I will ride 50km altogether. Once I get there I am going to do a virtual tour of the zoo! With the money I raise cycling to Chester Zoo I am going to buy as much as I can to help so that families will have lots of food and things that they need. I am very excited to help. ",False

It’s crazy how the pandemic we currently living in has caused all kinds of financial difficulties situations and families have had no choice but to turn to the food banks for help and assistance. I know that raising money will help the food bank buy essential food. It saddens me to see how the numbers have doubled as more people are being impacted by COVID-19 with job losses and furlough leaving families struggling to find money to buy enough food. We have all seen the headlines regarding school meals but it's easy to forget for a lot of these children that is the only balanced meal they will get. In the first six months of the pandemic  some food banks in the United Kingdom gave out a staggering 1.2 million emergency food parcels. That’s one food parcel every 13 seconds  and 2 600 of these went to children every day on average. I decided to walk 2021 km and hopefully get this achieved within 10 months. So if you see me walking please give me a cheer and some motivational comments. Every penny helps put food on the table and allowing families to try not stress financially or have to choose between food and heating. So please consider donating to a worthy cause.    So I'm looking for your support. Together we can make a difference.  ",False

To date we have over 400 volunteers who have supported over 150 households on a day to day basis – and done so much more as well  delivering information  building social media platforms  planning interventions to improve security and well being of all residents.     In terms of the support we offer  from shopping services to prescription pick-ups to a weekly check in and chat  everything has been possible thanks to a grant from the parish council  and mostly  the free time and willingness of our volunteers.    As we head to the summer  there is a growing need across Charlton Kings and our wider community. We are committed to keeping our phone lines open  our virtual connections active  and will be running community events. We will also continue our support to shielded households and those needing help to reconnect with the outside world. Within the Friends community there is a listening ear for anyone who needs it  any time.    We stand by to help every family whose circumstances are difficult - to do this we will need a bit of help. There are costs to what we are doing and many of you have asked along the way if you can donate or help to our cause – thank you. This crowd fund will support local people in Charlton Kings whose circumstances make food provision challenging. Every penny will put food directly into the hands of local person who risks going without (young or old). And every penny will be spent with Charlton Kings local businesses; returning your support into our local economy.    Need will be assessed locally by our thriving community groups  or signposted by schools  churches and more – those that can pay do  those that cannot  do not – and no-one beyond the very small core Friends team knows the difference.    Please give whatever you can. £3 is a lunch for someone. £30 is a food box for a week for a single household. £300 is a community BBQ. Please help us  help everyone  in difficult times.    Our funding ambition is based on 1 in every 100 homes needing some form of support.        Thank you              *This is in addition to government school meal vouchers and food bank support.

The following was taken from their about page -    We help and support people in crisis. We offer up to date information relating to the Covid19 Pandemic  and other issues regarding those living in North Wales. Our team and our community work together to help and support those who need us. We do this in a number of ways.     We aim to improve the quality of life of individuals and families experiencing poverty or distress in our local community by providing practical support. We have an extensive and well stocked food bank  toiletries  baby goods  toys  children's clothes  baby and premature baby clothes  and though our support network we have access to bedding  kitchen and other household items needed by individuals and families in crisis.     The people we help are facing job loss  debt and eviction  homelessness  fleeing violence  have drug or alcohol problems or are struggling with mental or physical health issues  younger people and asylum seekers and other problems.     I would love to not only give these hardworking individuals a much needed boost  but also in these torrid times   made much worse for some recently by the flooding  be able to help provide stock for their food bank so they can reach more people affected by poverty.

I am working with FIND  the local charity that delivers food packages to families in need in Ipswich  to make book bags for the children of the families who access the food bank. Lockdown has been a real challenge for lots of us  and the economic impacts of the pandemic have hit some families hard. For those families it can be even more difficult to keep up with school work  and almost 6 months out of school may have a huge impact on those children whose families are struggling financially. I work as an Usborne Independent Organiser and will purchase the books and activities from Usborne.

The fall off in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that we have had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased our costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries.

The virtual market launched in May 2020 following tremendous support from kind donors. www.localheroes.fadne.org. This initiative is currently completely self-funded and is being built from the grassroots up with the help a number companies  organisations and individuals with experience in storage  logistics  distribution  transport and digital technology who are all eager to see it succeed. So far  the initiative has been a huge success; 120 + orders 180 + boxes 80% + of suppliers have received orders. Our 10% 'Community Fund' has enabled us to deliver 1200 local eggs and 200 litres of fresh  local milk to the West End Food Bank. Currently delivering within a 5 mile radius of Newcastle  we are now looking to extend and deepen our reach by establishing a Local Heroes distribution hub in the Tees Valley. We need your incredible support once again to help us ensure that the 'new normal' includes a critical role for local  community driven food and drink. We will need to raise £4000 if we are to make this a reality. That would take our total to £10 000 which would be an incredible achievement A Tees Valley hub will also allow us to broaden the impact of our Community Fund to assist those in need south of the region.

I'm trying to raise money for Glasgow Food Banks which have become a disgrace to our society. After the Conservatives came into power in 2010  there has been a significant increase in Food Banks. The reason for this is that the Conservatives have imposed a large set of austerity measure which have removed the safety net from the most vulnerable in our society. This was a Conservative Government which the Scottish people DID NOT VOTE FOR. As a consequence more and more people are having to rely on using Food Banks just to survive. Imagine waking up every day and not being able to even feed your children never mind yourself? Well  unfortunately this is the harsh reality of what we are currently living in.    I will be walking from London to Glasgow on the 2nd of September to join the Independence rally on the 17th of September in order to raise funds for this cause. There will be the possibility of hitchhiking during the trip due to either severe exhaustion or running out of time to arrive in Glasgow. Therefore if you could possibly give as much as possible throughout this time period it would be greatly appreciated. I have my own funds to get there myself  therefore every single penny of your donation will be distributed to all the Food Banks within Glasgow. I will also be posting regularly on my twitter account: @thejohnsonss where I shall display my route to Glasgow in the coming days.    The reason this means so much to me is because the City of Glasgow is my home. On the 18th of September I am proud to say that The City of Glasgow voted YES - to Independence in order to help bring people out of poverty.    Similarly  the whole of Scotland unanimously voted to remain within the European Union. Yet to be pulled out of the European Union against our will is a complete and utter shambles. This can only mean that to stay within Britain  the use of Food Banks will steadily become the norm. This is not something I want for my country. I strongly believe that together Scotland though independence  and remaining part of the European Union can prosper as a Nation and prevent this occurrence from happening.    Not only will I be so thankful if you could please help to reach this target of £20 000  but I know others will be too. The demand for Food Banks is only increasing which means we must do what we can to help. Please share this far and wide. Please give what you can. Even a simple pound could buy a few tins of beans for someone.     Thank you.    Saor Alba  #Indy2",False

Volunteers are coordinated via the Eternity Church to help those in need with groceries  post  prescriptions  errands and more.      This page has been created to help with 3 critical aspects of this service.       1. Many people in self-isolation do not have access to cash. So far all transactions are paid for in cash  but this is tricky  and as time goes on  access to cash will become harder.     Anyone needing to use the service can now pay for their transaction here.      2. Well-meaning residents of Downham Market wish to make donations to the food bank  while these are still needed we must be discouraged from purchasing extra supplies  to avoid putting pressure on supermarket stock levels.    Via this page we can support anyone wishing to donate from the safety of their own homes  to their families  neighbours  or just anyone who needs it. This allows us to put the funds into the most needed items.      3. Volunteers are incurring costs while helping  and we wish to reimburse them.

But it's a slightly different one so I'd be really grateful if you could have a quick read and  if you're able to  make a donation to help provide some Light During Lockdown to the kids who need it.     On Monday 20th April most children in the UK would have been going back to school to start the summer term. With the whole country in lockdown due to COVID-19 and no end to this currently in sight  it is expected that kids will miss at least a few weeks of school  if not half a term or possibly even a full term. The schools have all been amazing in sending out resources and setting up online learning but not all children are able to access these  or have supplies at home to be able to continue their learning  or even keep themselves entertained  during lockdown.    With many families now facing financial difficulties  it is not possible for all children to get supplies such as reading books  stationery  craft supplies and workbooks. We are aiming to raise funds to put together packs of key resources for kids who need them to make sure that they can continue their education and  more importantly  find things to keep them entertained during this ongoing lockdown period. We are working with the Potters Bar Food Bank who will distribute these packs to any families that need them.     We are grateful for any donation and appreciate your support in what is a difficult time for everyone. Your donation will go towards making sure that kids are supported during lockdown and they are still able to find outlets through play  reading and writing.    Please spread the word – all donations are gratefully received and if you know of any other food banks that would be willing to distribute these packs in their local area  please let us know via the message function below and we will be in touch.

I’m a small dent in what I can do but if I can make £200 of difference it’s better than none. The money donated will go towards purchases for food banks  vouchers for supermarkets for people to purchase food & packed lunches. If you want to jump on board and help me  I’m here with open arms as there no real plan  I just know actions need taking and quickly. Let’s get as much as we can to them kids in need. Let’s pull together and make a difference - if you can offer out services which may support this again do approach me! The more the merrier. Clubs  coaches  parents  anyone! Let’s not just leave it for the shopping centre to ask for it in a big trolley with no meaning. Share and let’s try and tackle this head on.❤️ #Sheffield #LetChildrenEat",False

Its been hard for people to get around and has left people with choices of food on the table or heating for the home. We’re proud that we have been able to help so many families  however we’re ready to take that to the next level...     We’re looking to raise £10 000 for a new mobile food bank/community shop and well-being vehicle. The vehicle is completely mobile  has a number of uses and is self sufficient once on site  the vehicle also has a full wheel chair lift. We will be traveling to a number of areas in the community offering support to anyone who needs it!     To raise the funds the team will be doing the 3 peaks challenge in May - COVID restrictions dependent. Thank you all for your overwhelming support!   HHK TEAM ",False

As a school  family is important to us  this year has been tough for so many different reasons and the pressures of this current climate are visible to all to see.    Many people have lost their jobs because of the virus  there has been a surge in the number of people becoming homeless and without food.    Being the community school we are  its only right that we are at the forefront of ‘building our community for our community’ we are doing this by setting up a food bank to provide food and essential items for our most vulnerable young people and families within our school and wider community.      More than 2.3 million Londoners live below the poverty line and 33% of adults have skipped meals to save money so that their children can eat.      The Charter School North Dulwich Go fund me page will help us to raise money to purchase food for our most vulnerable young people and families. During the festive period food was donated to the Southwark central community hub.     Our donations page will be ongoing after the new year and all throughout the academic school year and beyond     Food parcels are available on request.

Covid has affected us all but it has hit parts of our community harder than others.     We carried on the amazing work that St Barnabas Primary School began with a 'Community Food Share'  providing food and essential items to local families in this time of need.     We currently support families within the BS2 and surrounding areas  100% of your donations helps us maintain our resources to provide a varied weekly package.     Job security is becoming less stable as the furlough scheme tapers out  gig economy workers can find less work and self employed people are also facing uncertainty  there is still a further need to do more and support people at this time.     We stand together and bridge the gap with this amazing and unified part of Bristol.        Thank you.

We know that many people are also struggling  having lost jobs and we are not asking anything of those people  of course. But there are some of us who are lucky enough to be able to work from home and continue to get paid. We're inviting you all to make a donation on those nights when you would have gone to the pub. Pay for the beers you have at home at pub prices and donate the extra. Give a little more to keep our wonderful local going.

Currently  there is a huge need to help support the food banks  as so many people are needing additional help  to put food on the table  which is where the idea came from.    Many people leading up to the bank holiday would be planning where they are going to stay overnight camping or in their vans or on holiday  sadly for the VE-Day weekend that can no longer happen. So why dont we celebrate at home ?    So the idea is simple plan your trip based at home  prepare everything you need to go camping  stay overnight on the drive in your van  a tent in your garden  or even in your house (but it must be set up like a camping trip)  or in your caravan.     So how do we raise funds ?   Donate a minimum of £5 in the pot or the amount you would normally have paid for a night camping at your favourite spot during the bank holiday weekend.  If local to Nailsea  the money will go to food bank in Nailsea  if not to the national food bank network  every £ will make a difference.    Its not just about fundraising  so let's have some fun  go to town decorating your place of accommodation  take pictures  upload them to the Facebook page  use your imagination to have an amazing night or more 'away at home!'",False

Due to the massive shortages of PPE masks and other protective equipment for NHS Front line staff  care workers and volunteers  not just locally but across the country during the current Covid-19 crisis  I have decided to use my time and experience as a creative prop maker in the film industry to help our front line heroes who are putting themselves in harms way every day to keep the public safe.    I want to help the drive to produce 3D printed full face visors based on a recognised format and supply them to staff at out local hospitals  care homes and local volunteers at food banks etc.    My plan is to be producing around 200 visors per week and all donations will be going towards purchasing 2 Eryone 3D printers  filament for the visor frames  clear plastic for the screens  bags for packing and transport as well as wear and tear on equipment.    There is a massive need at the moment and for the foreseeable future for these masks and the more creative industry workers we have making these  the more of our front line heroes will have a chance at being safer in their work.    The spirit and generosity I am seeing as a front line volunteer myself every day simply astounds and humbles me  and I sincerely hope that same spirit and generosity will be shown to this campaign and why I want to do it.

I am setting this up as my brother  who lives in a van  was recently broken into and some of his belongings stolen  most notably his laptop containing the work for his masters dissertation  which was unfortunately not all backed up. Obviously this is irreplaceable  and the damage is done  but if I can make it any easier for him to come to terms with it and hopefully help him repair his home that would be amazing.

Although we are trying our level best in treating patients affected by covid-19 in hospital  I feel that there is a lot more we need to do to help these patients in hospital as well as those affected by this pandemic in the community.    Many people are temporarily out of jobs and are struggling to make ends meet. Basic necessities such as food supply and toiletries for many families has become a burden. Families are having to resort to food banks to ensure that their families have something to eat. However  food banks are also in major crisis as they are opening their doors to more people than ever before during this covid-19 pandemic. Provisions that they would normally be supplying per week is now being distributed within a day.     At the same time  many patients in hospital are taking their last breaths of life alone without any relatives beside their side. Families are yearning to see and hear the voices of their loved ones fighting this disease in hospital alone. Yet  due to the highly contaminated nature of this disease  many hospitals are reluctantly having to stop normal hospital patient visiting times. Many patients with a background of dementia and/or Alzheimer's find it very difficult to understand why they are in hospital and what is happening to them. More so  being in an unfamiliar hospital environment without any families visiting them makes it even more difficult for them in aiding their recovery. It breaks my heart that families cannot come to see their loved ones knowing that they are in their last few hours or days of life.     The reason I am setting up this fund raising page is to help both patients and families to be connected in the hospital as well as those affected by covid-19 in the community. The money we raise will be used for two primary causes:    1) To collect enough money to buy food and basic toiletries that can be distributed to local food banks to keep up the pressure of ensuring that nobody goes hungry during this covid-19 pandemic.     2) To collect enough money to buy electronic ipads  phones and phone chargers for patients to stay connected through face-time with their families on the outside whilst they are fighting off this disease alone in hospital.

One such couple are my brother and sister in law have had to close their snack bar due to government restrictions because of covid 19. This was their only source of income as well as a much loved family business  built by my late dad and brother for the last 20  plus years. I’d say the van is a bit of a fife icon - being down the prom in Kirkcaldy  Highland games and most recently in Randolph industrial estate. This business means the world to my brother and he is absolutely devastated to have had to cease trading  particularly so soon after losing our Dad. As well as the business suffering  Chris has also suffered some pretty difficult health issues this year which has really knocked him for six  making dealing with this even more emotional and challenging. For those of you who know my brother personally  you’ll all know what a big heart he has and how much he helps anyone who needs it.

The Sikh Soup Kitchen serves the most vulnerable in the name of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji and his message of Langar (free communal meal). They support homeless and vulnerable members of the Community  through their Street Food Banks. The purpose of this event is to raise money for the food banks in order for the team to continue to support the vulnerable and homeless. In the month of July alone  the Sikh Soup Kitchen served over 1320 food packages!!     This is also a venture close to our hearts for another reason. We are undertaking this hike in memory of our dear friend and brother Jaspreet Singh Dhillon  who left this world on 25th July. We feel this venture and its cause will serve his memory well  due to his nature as a genuinely selfless person.     We would really appreciate any donations  little or big - every little bit makes such a huge difference.    Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa  Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.",False

The lockdown and Covid 19 have been particularly difficult on many BAME  low income and isolated families here in Edinburgh. In June 2020 ELREC started a food project to help bridge the gap between BAME people and food poverty and access to free food services such as food banks. This came about after ELREC was contacted by many community members asking for food support due to job losses  furlough  redundancies  and benefits income not being sufficient to live on for many families and also children being at home fulltime.    ELREC provided this work thanks to local funding but this has now ended  yet the demand for food parcels and halal meat for BAME families remains. The work is all volunteer led and these include ELREC staff  board members and our other volunteers who give up their time to help us deliver this project. ELREC provides on average 30 food parcels per week but not only put the parcels together but also deliver them to any family who are unable to collect them.     There are many BAME families within our communities who need and rely on this food support for many reasons but the standard food banks don’t meet their needs. Therefore  ELREC is asking for funds to top up their food support with specific items they need such as halal meat  nappies  baby milk or any other essential items.     Covid has only made matters worse with new data showing that 14% of adults living with children reported experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity in the last 6 months. Four million people including 2.3 million children live in these households. This compares to pre-Covid-19 levels of 11.5% amongst households with children.    The data revealed that 12% of adults living with children reported skipping meals because they could not afford or access food in the last 6 months.    4% of adults living with children reported having gone for a whole day without eating in the last 6 months.    10% of parents/guardians  affecting an estimated 1.9 million children  reported some form of child food insecurity in the past 6 months. Despite people returning to work and children to school  food insecurity remains extremely high for families.    While vital measures like the furlough scheme and Free School Meal vouchers may have prevented the situation worsening  a large number of children are still left in a precarious situation when it comes to securing the necessary healthy diet for them to grow  develop and participate actively in school and society. We want food equality for all  regardless of background.     Please donate what you can and help us keep doing this important work for our community. No child should go hungry and we pledge to use your donations to provide food support all year round  not just term time.

The HRFC development team are asking you to swap your comfortable beds for a sleeping bag / duvet and pick an unusual spot in the house or garden  spending a night out of your bed to help support a local community charity.      The Salvation Army in Hawick has been running a foodbank for a number of years in Hawick and in recent times  it has been vital in supporting the local community as the full effects of the pandemic were unfolding  more and more people were needing support. Since the beginning of Lockdown one in March 2020 the Salvation Army have provided 462 food parcels in excess of £23 100 value to the people of Hawick and its surrounding communities. This number continues to grow each day as poverty effects those from all corners of the community.      The event aims to raise some much-needed funds for the foodbank and to support its ongoing work within Hawick. Additionally  the event will allow that’s players who are involved within the ‘School of Rugby’ programme from Hawick HS and Hawick Youth RFC to deliver and be part of an event the contributes positively towards their local community.      So  if you have a shed  garage  tent  bath or even if you make a den in the living  please help support the players  coaches  volunteers and development officers in taking part in this community wide event  supporting with the fund raising efforts so that a local charity can continue their much needed  amazing work for Hawick.

In 2019 4 million children were living in poverty in the UK. With numbers set to soar this year we  as a family  wanted to pay it forward. We are hoping to raise money to make Christmas Eve boxes (well  bags) to give to local charities  food banks etc. Our aim is 100!!! 100 small gestures that will add some magic to what’s been a gloomy year for most. From a book to some chocolate coins all donations are welcome  whether that be direct funds or a few goodies thrown in to your weekly shop. We will be keeping the bags as universal as possible  something to read  something to eat and something to play with  in order to reach as many children as possible. A £5 donation is the equivalent of a Starbucks or Big Mac meal  yet that would buy 5 copies of the ‘‘twas the night before Christmas’  5 sets of felt tips  5 bags of magical reindeer food. It is the most wonderful time of the year after all!   Thank you  the Wrigley’s   XXX ",False

Since the outbreak of Covid-19  we have drastically changed the way we are working. We have switched to delivery-only food parcels in Moulsecoomb & Bevendean  and have seen an increase in demand from the first week. With more than 50 households now on our delivery list  we are in constant need of food donations. Many kind people  organisations and businesses have supported us  but to make sure we are able to continue delivering to an ever-increasing amount of households in our area  we are now seeking more support to be able to buy in food and items we desperately need but not always get through donations. We know the need won't end when the outbreak and lockdown is over  and any funding will help us bridge to a way back to our drop-in sessions. We expect that even when the Food bank can open its doors again  and people can come out to socialise and get advice and support in person  the world will still look different  so we want to be prepared for this transition period. Your support is very much appreciated by community we support and the many fantastic volunteers we are supported by. THANK YOU from all of us at the Bevendean Foodbank Committee.

My Dad  James Yule  recently turned 81 and  being on housebound lockdown for 12 weeks  he decided to do Couch to 5k on the back garden path.    (When my friends heard about Major Tom’s 100 laps for NHS  they thought it was my Dad!) Why?  Someone  BP  from a group he’s on  posted on the group page that - even though James didn’t ask for it - BP wants to sponsor him to complete his challenge  and he offered a donation to a charity of James’s choice!    This gave James his altruistic idea - That if people would like to encourage him to do it  by way of sponsorship  and other people can benefit from what he’s doing  then why would he get in the way of such generosity?!    As food and basic health needs are so fundamental/crucial for the people in the world who are most struggling  he would like the raised monies to go to the local food bank and/or care needs in the community.  St. Andrews Foodbank says:    “Those we serve may have lost their job  had a family split up  be victims of domestic violence  or had benefits delayed or suspended. In desperate times we are able to meet their immediate need for food.”  May we extend our human kindness to them.    How?  So  to make it easier for you to give  if you feel inclined  I’ve set up this page.    I will post updates between now and the end of May  by which he hopes to be able to complete a 5km run  actually running  for the half hour that the programme builds runners up to (and do the remainder by whichever means)!    What makes this a challenge  you might ask?   Doesn’t James do the Parkrun?    Indeed  James has done the Parkrun  before  and consistently since my Mum died  a year ago today  20th April.    He also has angina  a heart condition which makes running that bit more challenging for his body. So he will be doing it gradually/sustainably.    His mind/heart  whilst keeping it fit and agile - as well as desiring to support other people in the community to be well and healthy - is determined. How can you help?    With the challenge food banks face in receiving food from their usual sources (church congregations  supermarkets etc)  you giving money to this cause will ensure food banks are stocked  and people who need the support they offer can still access it.

Hopefully pull together and look out for the vulnerable members of our society. And that is exactly what we are doing for our community here in Great Sankey and Penketh.    An army of willing volunteers have stepped up and started putting leaflets through every door. This is to let the elderly and people who have had to isolate themselves know  people are offering them help. Help by way of shopping  picking up prescriptions  the newspaper  and much more. This has gone down extremely well and people are genuinely grateful there are people out there  neighbours they know and neighbours further afield  who are there for them.    However we have come up against an issue that you can help us with. People isolated in their homes are unable to get out and get cash to give to the volunteer doing the shopping. Therefore they won’t ask as they don’t wish to offend. Likewise we know we have people who would be willing volunteer but haven’t as they know they can’t afford to get someone else’s shopping  not even if they are able to pay them back once they have the shopping.     Then there are the people who of course can’t go out to work as they have been told to isolate and they & their families need to eat  but simply don’t have the funds.    So we have set up this Go Fund me page in the hope some people may feel this is a way they can contribute to the wellbeing and support of the people we speak of. We are receiving help from our Penketh & Sankey Parish Council but this fund is setup to run alongside that help to ensure we have money to immediately help those in most need in our community.    If you can donate  any sum no matter how small  then the fund will give us emergency finances which in turn will enable volunteers to go out and get the essentials for our “at risk” group of people in need and those in full isolation who simply cannot get out even if its solely to collect food as allowed.

With so many people facing either unemployment or reduced work there will obviously be an extra strain on the local charities like PATCH who support those in need through food-banks and various other means. PATCH is a charity that helps support us here in Milford Haven and all the surrounding areas.     Our aim is to raise £500 for PATCH by collectively running up the highest mountain in Wales  in Europe and in the World: Snowdon  Mont Blanc and Everest  a whopping 14714m. We will be measuring this by counting our collective 'Elevation gain' on Strava. That is not simply running 14714m  it is 14714m of climbing vertically!! Any walk  run or hill sprint will count towards this! Please help support us in what we think is an excellent cause.    Do you want to join us in making a difference? We're raising money in aid of PEMBROKESHIRE ACTION TO COMBAT HARDSHIP (PATCH) and every donation will help. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to us.",False

The island is an island of tourism  many of the inhabitants come from the other islands in Cape Verde to work and rely on the wealth of the world for their survival. The island is poor at the best of times  relying solely on tourism. The wages are low but the cost of living is the same as the UK  if not more. Some essential items like Paracetamol can cost an average of £5 per packet  completely unaffordable by the locals. Like the rest of the world  the island is now in quarantine  but this means the islanders are not allowed to leave to travel back to their native islands and live with their families. Without tourism  the locals are without wages and money or financial aids to support themselves - yet are expected to live and survive on next-to-nothing. There have been a few charities set up and have already started to hand out some food to the families  but it's not enough. With majority of supplies coming from overseas and high demand  the local shops have doubled their prices  so food is considerably more expensive and unafforadable for most. My daughter  Chiara often says to me ""Mum  you can't save everybody"" and of course I know she's right. Whilst I know money is tight in the UK and around the world  I just cannot ignore how these locals  who depend on the rest of the world must feel. I feel compelled to try to help them  hence this ""gofundme"" page. The monies will go directly to the locals to buy basic food  of rice  vegetables  water and supplies and distributed to the families in need. I hope you will consider their plight and help  any small donation will help and be a significant difference to those who need it the most. There will be difficult months ahead until tourism replenishes the island again  but they are the most fantastic and beautiful hosts. The islanders of Boa Vista will welcome you and any guests with open arms  today and always - so much you will never want to leave their beautiful island. Lastly  I thank you for taking the time to read this on behalf of the locals whom depend on tourism for survival. Myself  like everyone else really hope we can all return to what was once normal life soon  but in the meantime let’s do our best to look after those who treat us with nothing but love and kindness. Much Love Bruna. This is a request for help  on behalf of Igor Tequila and the Islanders on Boa Vista https://www.gofundme.com/f/boa-vista-food-bank",False

Sponsor me to help to achieve my goal to become a vegetarian. During this Covid 19 crisis and still until today  I have had support from a charity called The Sikh Soup Kitchen being one from the vulnerable group. Having no family around and Mom stranded in India I have had to call on them for support. They provide me with a hot meal  sandwiches and snacks along with daily essentials  so that I do not have to worry about going out. I am not the only one and they provide this support to the elderly and vulnerable- I am amazed for the amount of work that they do. They provide it to anyone in the Community that require any support. They provide a Street Food Bank Service every Friday and Saturday on Soho Road  Handsworth  where they hand out food to the people in need regardless of faith or race as they have strong Sikh principles to help anyone that they come across. The Sikh Soup Kitchen are a community/ food bank based service  whom you can call on and they will provide you with support and vegetarian cooked meals including any social support adhering strictly to the Government guidelines. I have been inspired by them to become a vegetarian from the lovely cooked meals that they have been providing to me in this pandemic. They also have a dedicated phone line  where you can call during the pandemic for a ‘friend to chat’ service. Please help me to achieve my goal to become a vegetarian and the money raised will go to The Sikh Soup Kitchen  so that they can continue to support the community in need with daily deliveries and Street Food Bank service (everything brought is transparent as receipts are shown on social media). If anybody wants to see them in action or volunteer then please contact me and I can arrange this for you. You are able to follow them on Twitter and see their daily work in action. @SikhSoup Please support me- I want to become a vegetarian and also support The Sikh Soup Kitchen with their ongoing selfless service. All funding achieved will go to them which will continue to provide the daily meals and Serve the Street Food Bank. Thank you Jas Kaur ",False

The Project /Building Purley Masjid​    Purley Masjid is a modern Islamic community centre in a suburb of South London  Purley. It was established in 2015 after fund raising to accommodate the needs of the local Muslim community.    Ma Sha’ Allah  the Masjid is now trying to cope with the demand and has to overcome many challenges to support the Muslim and also non-Muslim community. Here are just a few of examples of the issues:     We have one main hall which accommodates only 200 people for an average Jumu’ah congregation of over 400.      People often have to wait outside in the forecourt for the second Jamaat     Current facilities for ladies accommodates around 30  whereas the demand is known to be in excess of 150. This is severely restricting our ability to meet current demand for women     Our lectures  Fitness Classes  Mother and Toddlers group  daily iftaris in Ramadhan and seniors meet up sessions all take place on the same carpeted area on which we pray. This is not ideal and as we are effectively operating out of one hall  it means that we can only have one activity happening at any given time     The Food Bank only has enough space for a shelf rack to store food. It caters for anyone in need in the Purley community  Muslim and non-Muslim alike        By the Grace of Allah swt we have embarked on the Building Purley Masjid project that will cater for the needs of the community. The project will result in a new Masjid on the current Purley Masjid site and will be a modern  purpose built building for the community spanning 6 floors that will include:     Two male prayer halls with a combined capacity of 500     A ladies prayer hall with capacity of over 200 and crèche facilities      A multi purpose hall     A dedicated lecture/events hall (we held over 100 last year)  which can accommodate 100 people     Improved facilities for our already existing Youth Activities  Mother and Toddlers Group and Seniors Group     Separate classrooms for our Madrasah classes      More space for our weekly Food Bank  ​​    We already have all these activities running at Purley Masjid but are struggling to meet demands and keep up the excellent level of service we provide.",False

We are into the final week now with the last Half-Marathon being on Saturday 1st of August (fingers crossed)    I've been joined on this journey by so many running friends  it's been mind blowing. The number 1 question I'm asked by just about everyone is why are you doing it to which I have no real reply. That question is 99% of the time followed up by 'are you going to do charity collection' and I've promised folk that I'd put  one on in the last week. I guess this is said last week     A lot of the runs have started in Long Eaton  Most of the runners have been members of LERC and like me up to recently  are from the Long Eaton and surrounding areas. So I'd like to raise some money for a couple of local charities.    The first one is:  Cancan Trust which is a local charity that helps homeless folk & runs food banks in our area.  http://www.canaan-trust.co.uk/        and the 2nd one is:  Bilbo's Animal Rescue (I don't have a link but you can check them out on Facebook. Basically a local lady who rescues & adopts out small animals. She is well known in the community and a lovely lady.    Just to say  this is a Go Fund Me page I am using as I'm doing it for a couple of charities  so any funds raised will come direct to me and I will split them 50/50 between the two charities.

A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems. Barrow Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. There has never been a more crucial time to help those who are less fortunate than us - which is why I have organised this event.     The Covid-19 effect   Well before Covid-19 hit the UK  food banks in the Trussell Trust network had been seeing year-on-year increases in levels of need  with 1.9 million emergency food parcels given out in 2019/20. As Covid-19 hit the UK  the Trussell Trust saw an immediate and sustained surge in need across its food banks. In April there was an 89% increase in the number of emergency food parcels given out compared with the same month in 2019. This included a 107% increase in the number of parcels given to children  compared to the same period last year. New findings show that almost 100 000 households received support from a food bank in the Trussell Trust network for the very first time between April and June 2020. It's no secret that the pandemic has had a significant impact on people's jobs and finances - increasing the use of foodbanks nationwide.     What are we doing?   Since March 2020  many people (including myself) have adopted a new hobby in running. Whether it is to pass time  get out of the house  keep fit whilst the gyms are closed or a tool to manage your mental health. Everyone has their individual reasons for running and it would be fantastic to use this as an opportunity to help and support our local foodbank through completing a half marathon challenge (13.1 miles or 21.09 kilometres).     When?  Those who are taking part will complete the run on either Friday 23rd April  Saturday 24th April or Sunday 25th April - uploading their run to the page when complete.     Donations  There is a group target amount of £1 000 and every penny donated is hugely appreciated.

Blessed2Bless is a Charity determined to support the homeless and less fortunate within Birmingham and the West Midlands.     Every week we open our doors to deliver a food bank service within the city centre and work with more than 30 community-based volunteers to provide food directly to individuals and families.     We have been cooking a free breakfast and lunch every week on a Saturday for the past 5 years where those in need can come eat  socialise and learn. Blessed2Bless works in partnership with over 15 organisations and stores across the West Midlands to try and create a hunger free society.     Our volunteers focus on serving and developing resources in their local community. Our food bank provides emergency supplies of essential food and toiletries to individuals and families every week however we rely heavily on donations and goodwill.     We are applying for funds to help us to continue the good work but to also launch mobile food banks that can also go out to deprived areas and reach those who cant reach us or other resources.    Funds raised from this vital Go fund me page will be used for securing another vehicle to assist with our Mobile Food Bank service and supporting the weekly Food and meal service to the homeless and community    We can never achieve what we have done so far without fantastic partners   organisations and local community members who through their giving has helped us to achieve what we have so far.

Being part of a coastal economy is always difficult over the winter months  but the impact of COVID-19 is potentially catastrophic. Every time we ask a family to self-isolate with COVID symptoms  we’re essentially asking them to spend 14 days in a cold flat with no food. Very few of our families have a support network to rely on  because they are fleeing gang  drug or domestic violence in other parts of the UK; this means that most left their extended support network behind in Birmingham  Liverpool or Glasgow  in order to live in a place with no available infrastructure to deal with the escalating child poverty that’s been growing since the 1980s. All of our families live no more than 2 days ahead as far as food is concerned; they can’t afford to bulk shop and they don’t have a fridge or freezer to fill with supplies. Many of the young women we work with receive their feminine hygiene products from us as a school via the “Red Box” programme. Without that support  they have NO ACCESS to female hygiene products. Any period of time away from a free school meal means no access to food at the best of times; a second national or local lockdown will be catastrophic. Last time the country locked down (in March/April) we had parents ringing us in tears because they had no income  no food and (very frequently) no electricity to power the laptops that the government provided for remote learning. If this surprises you  it probably shouldn’t  because there are very many schools like ours. However  in this particular case you CAN help if you choose to. Please consider donating to our food bank; no donation is too small. We started with a small bunch of shopping bags  intending to provide a “Lockdown Survival Box” to every family we have to ask to self-isolate. Things have escalated since then  so we’re trying to run a full-on  in-house food bank from our school over the winter. We are THE BURTON ACADEMY (www.burtonacademy.org.uk) and our families need your donations  reshares and general goodwill. We’ll pick it up and run with it from there  yes? X ",False

Many families have been left to fend for themselves during this time with little support from schools and other social services. “Bridge the gap have a passion to support families  parents  children and those with additional needs as this is something dear to our hearts. At Bridge the Gap  we believe in social inclusion and want to combat the digital divide that has left so many people with no access to information  resources and learning.” - Melissa Francis had started to provide support to local families in the beginning by: Signposting them to services for further support for Befriending also offering virtual tutoring for children. Enabling access to food banks  food hubs and hot meals  Providing information on available support schemes and youth services for children’s basic educational needs (such as http://www.hackneyquest.org.uk/ and http://www.shortbreakshackney.com/short-breaks-offer-update-covid-19)  Supporting SEN families with information through https://www.hiphackney.org.uk/home.html Sourcing laptops and other devices for families that are not eligible for other kinds of funding  Sharing of information to families regarding benefit claims so that people are not pushed into homelessness. At the beginning of the pandemic  we worked with T’s tasty cuisine to provide 1 hot meal  food parcels and essential items every Wednesday for a short period. We continue to work alongside Hackney quest  the wickers charity  Caribeats and Connecting all communities organisation to provide care packages or a hot meal to families. Our main focus going forward is to provide laptops and other devices to families who otherwise would not be able to access them. These months of enforced homeschooling and unpredicted lockdown period have revealed the many barriers facing low-income families (incl. job losses  food insecurity  housing issues  domestic abuse  family bereavements and many more…). The closure of libraries and community cafes that were previously used for learning  job applications and other resources has further worsened this divide  with many people struggling to access information on where to get help. Many families have been left with no access to a laptop to continue their children’s learning and larger families have struggled to share one computer between parents working from home and multiple children needing access to online learning. since schools began to reopen after the first lockdown  we had still seen numerous amount of families still struggling for devices for their children till current  and even at present through this uncertain wave of numerous lockdowns  the list of referrals are rising as families desperately require a device for their children  hence our determination to continue with this project to help families. We have teamed up with tutors around different boroughs to provide online learning for children with the aim for children to be supported with learning they have missed out on. We aim to continue to support families to help make a difference to their lives.     Your generous donation can help make a difference.      £1000 can help support 10 families and their children or 7 families.     The break down per refurbished device is £85 per unit £15 for windows 10 to be installed per device equal to £100 per device and software.    For 10 families this will be £1000 required to raise to offer support.    For a new device purchased from curry's under a business rate of £150 we will only be able to support 7 families with a device.     1 X Amazon Tablet for a family in need (£50.00) Fuel costs to cover the expenses of our generous Community Helpers so they are not out of pocket. We think this is a really effective way to support families in Hackney and in other borough's that has reached out to our service  as we are offering a long-term solution to an urgent need. So far we have been able to offer 136 plus digital devices to families  and have 47 families are on the waiting list with more requests coming in.

We’ve had some amazing moments up on the roof - a country band  a brass band  a choir  as well as coverage from national media including the BBC and several viral clips online.    After 20 weeks of rooftop shows at the end of September I’ll finally be bringing this season of concerts to a close. So to make sure we go out with a bang - I’ve decided to make the last couple shows on September 11th & 18th really special.   I’m going to collaborate on these last shows with Grime MC’s from my local area of Tottenham. As a folk/country artist primarily  this is a really exciting prospect to me. It’s a chance to reach out beyond my musical comfort zone  and to create something new  spontaneous  and which speaks to the moment we’re collectively living through. I don’t know how folk and grime are going to sound when combined - but I’m very excited to find out.       I also feel like it’s a chance to create an encounter between parts of my neighbourhood that might not always have that much to do with one another - and with any luck to foster a sense of togetherness through the power of music.      To pull this off we need to upgrade our live streaming set-up significantly. Every week since the start of April I’ve been broadcasting the shows from my phone - but to capture a concert on this scale  involving a full country band and MC's across 3 rooftops - we need to hire a multi-camera set up  with professional audio. A collaboration like this will also involve rehearsals and musicians fees. I’m doing all of this at absolutely the lowest possible cost I can - but in all honesty we’re still a little over a grand away from covering costs.       So in order to make this a reality - I’m asking for your help to balance the books - anything that you feel able to chip in towards making this goal a reality  will be received with enormous gratitude and appreciation. Anything that we make above the goal will go directly to our wonderful partners #LiveForLove  the campaign to support UK Food Banks  for whom we’ve played 18 shows and counting!       Thanks for checking this out. I feel like we’ve got a unique opportunity to create something really special here before the end of summer. If this sounds like something you'd like to support  and you feel able to chip in  be a part of it and and help us pull off - huge gratitude and appreciation are in order. THANK YOU.",True

We are so excited about the prospect of bringing this old Grade II listed building back to life! It was originally built in the early 1900’s as a Temperance Hall  since then it has had a plethora of uses  most recent of which left the building in a semi-derelict condition which included severe fire damage.    However  following its acquisition by The Tab Church  fresh ideas began to surface as to how it might be rescued  restored  and adapted to suit the needs for modern usage as Church  Community and Conferencing facility.    The ‘Tab1Milli’ is what will enable this most significant part of the Big Build project vision to become a reality  and the building actually able to be used.    But we can’t pull this off without your generous support because this is the largest financial project The Tab has ever undertaken.    We are therefore asking you to join with us through radical generosity  as together we step out in faith towards hitting the £1Million target by continually bringing our financial gifts together now and over the coming weeks and months.    Once the entire building is renovated  it will enable The Tab to continue and expand its traditional church functions and community initiatives  which are not limited to but currently include:  · Sunday services  · Kids church for children  · Crèche during the Sunday services  · Weekly prayer meetings  · Christian education and classes  · Administrative offices  · Bookshop/resources  · Food Bank – hosting Lewisham Central’s foodbank and distribution point. This is currently offered two-three times a week  staffed by 8-12 volunteers.  · Youth mentoring – support for vulnerable young people in the local community.  · Community action team (Restoration Empowerment and Community Help) – which focuses its support and resources on three vulnerable groups in Lewisham:  The elderly (offering days out and grocery food supplies);  The homeless (offering food clothing to those living on the streets)  and  Women and children escaping from domestic abuse (offering support).    *The Big Build Project includes the overall vision of Tabernacle Global Ministries and therefore maybe used for general purposes....",False

The Government voted against covering the cost of extending free school meals for our most vulnerable children during the upcoming school holidays. We cannot punish children for the economic hardships their families endure. All money raised will first be given to local food banks over the holiday period. Ideally we will beat our target and try and deliver food to a much larger area. Absolutely anything you can spare will help a child to not go hungry.     Thank you.

The post involved me telling a little about my life since losing my wife Michelle.     She was 37yrs old. She died after the flu virus caused a massive cardiac arrest. She died in front of me in Whiston hospital and the A & E team struggled for six minutes to bring her back. They did manage to do so and she survived a further 7 days before a brain scan shown irreparable brain damage and I was told there was nothing could be done for her. We withdrew care on Easter Sunday 2016.     Michelle (like myself) was a primary school teacher. As such  following her death I have recieved a small pension from her. Every month since she passed awaya I try to use some of the money I receive from her pension to help a cause that catches my eye in her memory. These are usually things like friends running marathons  park benches in memory of people who have died or other things that touch me.     This month my son Billy and me decided we should do something about the number of people in our local area who simply do not have enough food in their homes to feed their families. So we used some of the money from Michelle's pension and the money we would have spent on Christmas dinner (as we have been invited to a friends house) to buy all sorts of 'stuff' to give to our local food bank. We bought tinned veg  nappies  sanitary towels  baby wipes and UHT milk. It felt great doing this. Money well spent.     Someone asked me to post 'our efforts' in the group and the response was unbelievable. It seems to have touched the hearts of many people. 4500+ (and climbing) reactions  hundreds of shares. I was amazed. I have had several people send me money via my paypal account and many more ask how they can help. So I thought as I had perhaps unwittingly created a platform to help people out I would ask for that help via a GoFundMe page. I think that's how people do these things now?    One of the emails I had was from someone who sent me £2 with an apology. 'I am sorry it isn't more.' I wrote back to say £2 will never ever 'not be enough'. If £2 is what you can afford to give then £2 is enough. £2 is amazing. £2 could help turn someone's life around. So yep...I am asking for £2. More if you can afford it...less if I am asking too much. My point is...it does not matter how much. What matters is you did.     So there it is. I am not sure how successful this will be but if everyone who reacted to my initial post gave £2 that would double the amount I am trying to raise. To be fair...how much I put in the box isnt a goal. My goal is to raise as much as I can to buy food and other essential items for people who need it. If it's another £2 then that's 4 packets of sanitary towels...if it is another £200 then that is trolleys full of food. £2000 and I think we may be genuinely changing lives. Something everyone could take pride in.     I would ask this one thing though...I would ask that if you do decide to donate to this fund raising that you do not hide your name. I want to know who you are. I want my son to see you. This is as much about helping me in #makingaman out of my boy as it is helping people you don't know eat.

For 4 years  we owned a prominent petrol/gas station in Hillsborough  North Carolina (USA)  until it tragically caught fire in June  2009. Our insurance company did not give us a fair payout. In December  2007 we moved our family to Ghana  Africa to start up a new business and carry out missionary duties. After a series of extreme robberies  we decided to join my husband's side of the family in the United Kingdom to start a new life.      For the past 6 ½ years  the Home Office have denied our family the right to remain and work in the UK several times after arriving on a visitor’s visa. Because of our legal status in the UK  we are not entitled to ANY benefits (despite my son being born here)  and have been dependant on food banks  our church  and the kindness of strangers.     Despite these barriers  our family have been heavily involved in our community here and play an instrumental role in various lives. Collectly  we have won several awards for the way we engage  volunteer and serve our community.    On the 14th of October  2015 we had a tribunal hearing  but our case was immediately dismissed by the judge. We were left devastated  humiliated and depressed  to say the least.     A week later  (22nd of October  2015) my husband passed away suddenly due to the stress of moving our family back to the States and the thought of his children's hopes and aspirations were shattered.    Me and my 4 children have been left devastated  destitute and hopeless. Our health is down. Our minds are overcrowded. We terribly miss our leader and provider. Kitoko was an extraordinary human being who was always giving  loving  and a true server to humanity. He was a father who loved his family unconditionally and invested time and love into us.     Our family are in serious  desperate need of help to raise money primarily for a new appeal  solicitor's fees  everyday living cost  (food  utilities  housing  transportation  school lunches  medical bills  etc.) and money for a tombstone for Kitoko’s grave which is around £1 500.

A pipe-walking roadmap  With the Scottish Government relaxation of lockdown guidelines on 28 May I began gradually reducing the frequency and extent of my pipe-walking  concentrating on the main or bigger streets. I had a quiet autumn and even quieter winter  but as of early April 2021 I am getting active again. I plan to continue as last year  but much less intensively. Please keep requests coming for any special events and occasions you may have. For children and the elderly  ill or vulnerable  the level of modest donations I suggest is significantly lower than for others.    And if you know your history....   On 28.3.20  I picked up my oft idle bagpipes and started wandering rather cluelessly round Broxburn and Uphall playing them. I had realised that as a semi-retired person I was pretty much 'alright Jack' under lockdown and wondered if I could do anything to help others. My first idea  on 20 May  had been to go to NHS Strathbrock and play for the amusement of staff and patients. That day I also put my busking hat down with a sign saying ""all proceeds to...."" After securing permission from the police  I decided to put the hat back on my head and start my ""pipe-walks"" around Kirkhill and West End  intending to return to the Strathbrock  of course  and at least three facilities for older residents near me.

Many people were soon wanting to give me money in return for my effort to cheer them up and relieve boredom  and when I refused all payment some suggested I should start some kind of fundraiser. Enter Kelly - thank you. I'm already adding to and improving my musical equipment and piper's costume.

We desperately need to be able to extend this service to the even more vulnerable in our community for whom the £3/£4 per meal is too much.  We currently support over 100 people from Westerham  and the neighbouring communities of Crockham Hill  Brasted  Sundridge  and Biggin Hill  and have capacity for many more.

Their neighbour  who is a Leicester City Council tenant  had been using portable generators and it was one of these that had caught on fire which spread to Iqbal's home.     At home at the time were Iqbal's wife and four daughters aged 5-15yrs. Iqbal was at work when the fire broke out and rushed home as soon as he had heard what had happened.       The fire spread into Iqbal's home and the family was forced to evacuate into emergency accommodation. Unfortunately  the family did not settle well into the accommodation due to the overcrowding and stress the family was under. They left the emergency accommodation the following day due to stress and anxiety.      The family stayed with relatives for a couple of weeks in a one bed flat. They knew this was unsustainable with their large family however at least they felt safe. LCC informed their relative that the family couldn't stay any longer due to overcrowding and the family was forced to move out the following day.      The family sofa surfed for a few weeks until they were able to find a vacant property that they could just about afford to rent. The property they found needed a lot of work doing to it and Iqbal put his DIY skills to good use fixing up the property in return for reduced rent. However  it was still 4 months until the family managed to get hot water  heaters and to this day there is still no insulation in the walls.      The effect this has had on Iqbal's family is immense and the young children have been deeply affected by the trauma and chaotic living arrangements  overcrowding and lack of basic services. Iqbals eldest daughter is going through her GCSEs and this whole ordeal has really knocked her confidence and prevented her from focusing on her studies. Iqbals' eldest daughter has been diagnosed with psoriasis and her hair is falling out  doctors' have said this is a direct result of the stress of the fire and the subsequent house moves. The other children are also affected in many different ways.      As Iqbal's home was a private property which unfortunately had no insurance at the time the family is stuck in a real situation where they are unable to buy another home. Leicester City Council has offered to buy the land at less than a third of the market value as long as the family can raise the selling fees. Iqbal is still paying the mortgage and has no additional income or savings to cover the costs of repairs which have been estimated to be £35 000. The house that the fire originated in has now been fully repaired and refurbished by Leicester City Council  yet Iqbal's home is still in ruins and uninhabitable.      Iqbal and his family have been visiting a local food bank at E2 in Beaumont Leys to help them through their situation and have been knocked from pillar to post in their attempts to get this resolved with Leicester City Council which has recently come to a dead end.       If Iqbal was able to raise £35 000 it would mean that his family could get the repairs completed and move back into their home and their children can return to a sense of normality.  ",False

So I was sitting at home last week and saying to my husband how lucky we are that we can work at home without distraction and we got to chatting about how hard it is to be a working parent with young kids at home trying to juggle work and school work and feeding time lol and I came up with an idea of delivering fresh lunches in my local area to take a bit of pressure off parents and this has really taken off so well and for that I'm extremely grateful ❤    When I first advertised this service I mentioned that if any families are struggling financially that I would deliver these lunches to children or the elderly (who are worried about going out) And that they would be free of charge and that if anyone messaged me for the free service that it would be in the strictest of confidence     I have over the last few days received some heart breaking messages and I'm delighted that I've already delivered these families lunches this week free of charge     In my local community in Carryduff the support has been overwhelming and the donations that have been sent have been so gratefully received  so a few of the donors had mentioned that I should set up a go fund me page so we can help as many people as possible in these weird times we are living     I also have contacted numerous food banks in Belfast and will be delivering meals to them every week now which is just amazing     So thank you already to the many donors and if you feel u want to help even £1 goes a long way to make a lunch     Thank you thank you thank you for all your generosity so far you really are helping me make a difference In these family's lives     Going forward we will deliver food parcels if needed as well as lunches     IF YOU ARE IN NEED PLEASE CONTACT ME I CAN HELP ❤    Sending you all love     Kerri xxxx",False

They are being faced with the horrible reality of either feeding their family or heating their house and buying fresh groceries has become a luxury  this is something we at ‘Free Shop’ want to address.   Our vision is to have a ‘free shop’ where ANYONE who is in need  no matter their background or circumstances  can shop for FREE. They will be able to choose from as range of fresh groceries and daily essentials completely free of charge. These will be procured through local donations from Crawley businesses and individuals. ""From Crawley to Crawley"". We want to put the pride back into the simple act of feeding the family and allow those in need  the gift of choice.    We are a group of mums who saw a need and are doing something about it.    We aim to provide:    • Fresh groceries   Butter  dairy free butter  Bread  glutten free bread  Fresh milk  Eggs  Apples  Satsumas  Pears  Potatoes  carrots  parsnips  butternut squash  broccoli  cauliflower.  • Non perishables   Baby formula ( variety of brands) UHT milk  free from items  gluten free pasta  dried pasta  canned sweetcorn  peas  beans  tomatoes  • Non-food items   Nappies  baby wipes  teething gel  calpol  napisan  nappy rash cream  washing tablets  washing up liquid  toilet roll  kitchen roll  shower gel  bubble bath  shampoo  conditioner ( where necessary children and adult versions)  • Baby bank outpost  Baby clothes 0-8years  small selection of other essential baby items. Provided though a collaboration with Little Gifts (an already established baby bank)    WE NEED YOU!  We are already in contact with local supermarkets to provide a selection of stock through the FareShare Scheme but in order to provide a large enough quantity of fresh food to the growing number of people in need  some items will need to be purchased in bulk using the funds raised here.    Our buy in for the Fare Share Scheme costs us money. We need £450 by December to continue to be part of the scheme (to cover December-March) to recieve fresh items at this heavily discounted rate each week (first month is free). This is not out of date produce  it is for fresh items direct from the supermarkets at a reduced bulk buy price especially for charities such as ours. We will need approximately £150 per month for this plus any items we need from the cash and carry. We expect our current food costs to be approximately £250 per month. This is before we purchase alcohol gel and cleaning products etc. So please support us if you can!    If you are in a position to support us financially  even the smallest donation would help us to provide fresh food for someone in need.

It keeps us safe.     As an intensive care doctor dealing with some of the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic I am massively in favour of anything that might keep us all safe. I have therefore been upset at the misinformation going out around oxygen levels and masks  as well as confused messaging on when to wear them (indoors!)     In another life (2019!) I was a triathlete and the pandemic has robbed me of much of my fitness. So to kill two birds with one stone I will run to and from work wearing a mask  and with an oxygen sats meter. I'll post photos (Twitter and Instagram  @LawtonTri). It's 8 miles each way  and if it's nice weather I'll make one of them a half marathon. In between runs  I will be looking after patients (some with COVID-19) and wearing a mask. If I can run 16-21 miles masked  you can probably make it round the shops.

So many are struggling right now  and for many reasons are unable to provide or be provided with proper warm  nutritious meals due to many devastating circumstances.    I will be making the meals and providing a collection service (location to be confirmed)  until I am able to set up a full collection point in Saffron Walden. I will also be offering a local delivery service for people who are unable to collect meals whether that being due to having to isolate  no transport or having to work. Whatever reason is 100% ok and there will be no questions asked. As soon as a collection point is confirmed  I will publish it. If meals are being delivered  they will be done within a 2 hour time slot each day.    I will be serving meals Monday and Wednesday to start with  dependant on demand  and will be gradually increasing to Monday to Friday.    Meals will be ready to collect/deliver every morning with a daily menu rotation.     All meals will be vegetarian reworked ‘classics’  such as bolognese  pesto pasta and shepard's pie and served with a portion of vegetables.    Whilst starting out  the meals will be served on a first come first serve basis. Please message to reserve. Any leftover meals I will make all community groups aware of and if there’s no takers  I will deliver to the local food bank.    Please pass this message on to anybody who could benefit from receiving these meals  or any sources who can reach people who may need them.    The most important thing to know is it’ll be no questions asked and 100% confidential. Everyone needs a little help right now.

Diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer in the lungs and bones.        Thank you for choosing to read this page.  I don't quiet know where to start  however I know I need to start  for my lovely mum.    Those of you who know Andrea will know she is an extremely kind  caring  funny and positive person  who works as a self employed psychotherapist and counsellor. Those of you who know us  will know me and my mum have always been the best of friends and are extremely close  so this news saddens me deeply.     My beautiful mum was diagnosed with Cancer for the very first time in 2006 when I was just 7 years old. This was Skin Cancer  she had to battle it and work at the same time  such a hard thing for a single mum with two young kids  but after treatment and ops at Christie's Cancer Centre she bravely recovered.     Only to be diagnosed again in 2015 with Breast Cancer Stage 2 a very difficult time for us all  I remember the difficulty  going through my GCSE's whilst caring for my mum physically and emotionally. Financially this time was challenging for us as a family  as my mum has always worked so hard to provide for my brother and I  without any financial support from fathers. When she was diagnosed  the ops and treatment on top of the emotional pain made it so she really struggled to work  but had no other choice. The financial strain was one of the most stressful elements of her illness  and this really shouldn't be the case when you're facing a life threatening illness. We accessed food banks to eat and didn't get to enjoy pleasurable things that normal families do  instead I remember having to spend my wages from my part time job on food for our family. This was an embarrassing time for my mum as a mother works all her life to provide for her family but Cancer takes this right away  she tried so hard  never once giving up or asking anyone for anything.     My mum has always been a big believer in spiritual  holistic and alternative therapies  so she chose not to take the Chemotherapy which the doctors strongly advised claiming she wouldn't live more than a few years if it was not taken. She braved this and stayed true to her beliefs and used holistic  complementary therapies and PMA. Thankfully she was given the all clear from Breast Cancer and she started working as a therapist after completing her degree whilst fighting the cancer  and has never looked back since  she has been nothing less than completely dedicated to her job and gives her all to her clients  ensuring they feel fully supported and cared for.    Those of you who know Andrea for whatever reason she may have come in to your life  I'm sure everyone has the same view of her - a beautiful  selfless  generous and truly strong  inspiring woman. A woman who remains so positive and selfless regardless of what life throws at her.    Jubba  my mums younger sister passed away of Cancer in November  my mum received her unfortunate results on just 2 weeks after. Therefore it is even more of a difficult time for her  and all the family.    My mum first lost her voice last in November 2017. After undergoing investigations she discovered half her vocal cords have become paralysed. This means  if you haven't heard her  her voice is barely a whisper and has been like this for over a year. This has made her job as a counsellor very strenuous. Just before this Christmas  in November 2018 mums year long investigations (biopsy)showed cancerous cell changes in the lungs and that the canceous cells from the Breast Cancer had spread and there is now cancer in the sternum (breast bone) and lower spine  as well as other scattered locations around the body. My mum  my brother and I sat through the dreaded meeting with the cancer specialists on 4th Jan 2019 which we had been thinking of all Christmas  to be told that mums now has Secondary breast cancer which is metastatic and in the lungs and bones. We tried to remain calm however to be told that the cancer is Stage 4 and if treatment is taken then life expectancy is on average 2 years but 5 years at maximum. I struggled to hold it together and broke down in tears. The thought of loosing my only parent and absolute best friend  who has worked so hard all her life to be such a good mum to me  at this young age devastates me.     The doctors spent hours emphasising the severity of this Cancer  and how essential treatment is  and fast. My mum was advised to take a high dosage of IV chemotherapy 2 years intense at Christies Cancer Centre however  she has always been very resistant to such strong conventional medicine and made clear that if she was going to be given 2 years to live  she'd rather live these years to the fullest and not ill  bedbound from such harsh treatment. We have decided as a family and with the doctors for my mum to start treatment which consists of a little less intense Chemotherapy and a specialised medicine herceptin this Friday 11th Jan which she has to take every 2 weeks and go to the hospital every 3 weeks.     Being a single mum she has a lot on her plate  the side effects of this treatment will really rid my mum of her ability to function as normal  and will even make daily tasks a challenge nevermind her full time work as a therapist. Such as breathlessness  dizziness  bruising  stinging  arthalgia  myaliga  insomnia  jaw pain  increased risk of serious infection  lethargy  sore mouth  nausea and vomiting  heartburn and serious energy loss. As you can imagine  trying to hold a full time job down which is essential to live and pay bills would be incredibly hard and virtually impossible.    SO I've decided to set up this page  without my mums awareness to help alleviate some of the constant stress that shouldn't be her main worry when suffering a life threatening terminal cancer.     The generous donations will be spent on things like mums transport to and from hospital (as she doesn't drive). I am hoping that your kind donations will be able to enable my mum to not have to burn herself out and work  as much as she loves her job  it is detrimental to her health  it kills me seeing her so emotionally and physically exhausted  without any other option. **Since donations have been so generous I am really encouraging my Mum to see less clients and spend her energy on her own health  but this is fully dependent on your generous donations  so thank you so much.**    The money will enable my mum to explore alternative therapies and treatment such as holistic treatment which is never funded by the NHS (I know she has a list of many things she'd like to try but simply can't afford). Complementary therapies  counselling so that she can discuss the pain and fear this painful news brings. My mum also used to attend yoga classes but she recently had to finish as she told me she has to cut out luxuries due to money being limited and only based on how much she can work  so I would love her to be able to afford these classes again to help her health. And lastly  the money would go towards trying to find anything she can to help  I know she'd love to eat nutritious healthy foods that will help build her immune system and fight.     Andrea is and always has been the most generous and selfless person  you won't catch her being able to receive gifts or money very easily at all  however she'll easily give you her favourite ring or jumper if she thinks it suits you and you like it! She wont think twice about dropping everything to be there for you if you need someone. And she's never changed.     *Due to such devastating news I have chosen to leave my degree at the University of York and come home to care for my lovely Mum  so do message me if you have any ideas or ways you could help support.*    I will be looking to put on a fundraising event to raise money for my Mum so please do be in touch if you can help/have ideas.     I appreciate you taking time to read this and any donation no matter how small will honestly be so appreciated.    Love  Grace x      ",False

I work for an NHS Older People Community Mental Health Team; so my clients are generally over the age of 70 and have diagnosis such as anxiety  depression  schizophrenia and dementia.    Many of my clients are self-isolating  and lots of them have family or carers that are doing their food shopping  so they are well supported.    However  quite a few of our clients live by themselves or with their elderly husband or wife  with no other support. These are the people my colleagues and I are most worried about. They are unsupported and at high risk.    As you know there has been an amazing volunteer movement in response to Corona Virus lockdown. However  due to red tape issues the volunteers aren't being linked with our clients in need of this support as quickly as we'd like.

I know times are hard but please please give a donation  of whatever you feel you can  so we can help our most vulnerable clients live through their self-isolation.

Since our phones going live on 20th March  we've helped an amazing 490 households with requests for shopping  prescription pick ups and friendly phone calls for those feeling isolated and alone.    We have helped the local food bank to re-open which is great but there is still higher demand than can currently be met and we will be using these funds to provide for those that are unable to provide food for themselves due to the current situation.    We also provide support to families or individuals who have no other support during these uncertain times with things like shopping  collecting prescriptions  a friendly phone call or contact with other agencies like Age UK or mental health groups.    Being isolated on your own can be incredibly lonely and we want to do all we can to help our community through this lockdown period too.    We have registered over 700 volunteers to date who have all kindly offered their time to help within the community and have a list of phone handlers taking your calls and a phone support team ready to call people who need a friendly call.    Please visit our facebook page for more information about us.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/640602819838714/    We work with other charities and organisations helping local vulnerable people and we reserve the right to use donations to this page to support their work where needed.",False

Since last Monday I have handed out 12 parcels with all but two going to families with school age children. If you contact me larger quantities can go into church. I know it is hard doing the shopping so I'm saying please bring items that your family don't eat or you don't need that week. Money is useful as I can use it as John's Discount and they will deliver.

The knock on effect of lockdowns will see many struggling to earn enough to cover basic needs. While also being stuck at home through winter  sometimes it's a choice between eating or heating.    Access to food banks can be a lifeline to people when they most need it.    While we at Brixton Music Community celebrate the possibility of nightlife returning soon  we also see the chance to go out and dance to music as a privilege that people shouldn't take for granted.    So for the last leg of lockdown  on 12/03/21 from 12pm we are broadcasting a 24 hour music marathon from Larry Sun to keep people staying in doing the right thing  while hopefully raising some money to get mouths fed and bellies full.

The individual /individuals have taken tablets that were used for referrals to the fuel bank to enable those in crisis to receive an emergency payment and for a nationwide surveys into foodbank from Edinburgh university. They have taken our main hard drive /pc all are password protected . They have obviously ransacked the office and damaged our filing cabinets. Along side the items we need to replace   they have taken around £200 that was donated over the Christmas period which obviously provides much needed funds for the day to day running of the foodbank. Food was taken too  so we are putting an appeal out for tinned fish  rice pudding  tinned fish   tinned tomatoes and uht milk.   We as a charity can little afford the extra costs incurred to replace the more valuable items and office furniture. Any donations will be greatly received and used to help to wider community .      As stated our original target was £1000 and we have blown away by the generosity of the wider public. I am one of the merry band of volunteers at Oldham Foodbank. We offer assistance to those in crisis with food parcels for 3 days . As we have smashed our target   extra money raised will be used to enhance our current security systems to prevent ourselves from being targeted again . Furthermore the money raised will secure day to day expenses of the Foodbank for the foreseeable future   enabling us to continue to provide to those in need and crisis.   All monies raised is to be transferred to Oldham Foodbank bank account which is run by our Trustees.     Update on 17/5/19     We are in the process of withdrawing funds   The funds will be withdrawn via the manager of the Foodbank and promptly transferred to the Oldham Foodbank account which the Trustees will be able to allocate funds as we require them .   Once again Thank you   a photo showing the transfer and statement will be placed via this page for transparency.     ",False

Its unprecedented times with COVID-19 spreading throughout the world and it is most definitely now Nourish  along with the fabulous local community groups pulling together as a whole  needs to step up and support everyone. Its vital that we make sure noone is going without  despite the devastating effect panic buying is having on the vulnerable. People are going without the necessary. Many business's are trying so hard to keep afloat by offering deliveries and takeaways  which is great but only if you have enough money to survive like this.   I will be doing door step deliveries of frozen ready meals  free to absolutely anyone who is struggling. I have had to make some changes to do this and this means sourcing ingredients away from supermarkets and scale up volume which means its going to cost a little bit more financially.     I appreciate that times are going to be hard for many of us but if you could spare a little to help fight the great fight  then I thank you from the bottom my heart - please  stay safe  stay well and together with care  we can get through this.    This is my story should you care to read on :)    I used to work many years ago as a cook and learned so much from my late mum but illness struck and I lost my confidence. Only through volunteering and thanks to the patience of Monkton Wyld Court and to Halff in Axminster in very recent years did I gain my confidence back in a professional kitchen environment.     I myself know what its like to live on the breadline and have watched in horror what the impact of Welfare Reform has done to people in our community and beyond. With benefit sanctions being handed out almost at the drop of a hat  the bedroom tax  disability benefits now even harder to access and Universal Credit people are really struggling. Here in Axminster we have one or two avenues in which to source out food to help us get by when times are hard. Our Food Bank is a wonderful and much needed resource which distributes non perishable foods such as dried rice/pasta  tins and processed foods and other necessities. Once apon a time the need for a food bank would have been a short stop gap  but now  for some  its a weekly ocurrance.     The impact of this continual type of diet not only has an effect on our physical well being (more so if suffering a health issue or illness) but on our mental well being too and then  that spiral of isolation  hopelessness and depression can begin.     Nourish insists each meal must have at least two vegetable components not including onions or potatoes. We cook in bulk and freeze meals in portions and distribute for those to store/cook at home.     We have been surviving on cash donations (and some food donations) given personally by hand by the kind people of Axminster (and even some who dont even live here!!) and its those important donations that allow us to cook meals full of nourishment to compliment the already existing food bank facilities in the town. It is hoped that our meals are a nutritional break without the thought of having to cook. A little bit of love to try to ease people through some really hard and dark times.     Nourish is also putting into plan how to ease ""holiday hunger"" when the schools finish for the summer holidays. Many parents rely on that free school meal in term time to ease the grocery bills and sadly sometimes that is the only meal some children may get.     Any money raised or donated to Nourish will go towards mostly fresh ingredients for our meals. There are some other necessary costs  like the containers and admin materials and occasionally some rent/hire costs.     Incidently  if you are a local grower or allotment user.. please think of us when you have an abundant crop of vegetables and fruits :)    Nourish is working in Axminster and has been met with such positivity and your donation is very very much appreciated.     We are only ever two pay days away from being on the brink..     Thank you    Karen",False

Katrina enjoys writing stories for children in her spare time. Some of her stories have been shared with the children in our school and she has recieved some amazing feedback from the children who have loved her stories. She has kindly shared another story with us  that she has written about the Coronavirus. This is to  hopefully  enable us to raise funds for our food bank that has been extremely useful to those in need at this difficult time. Not only that  it has helped 71 families so far.

The Rev Mandy Brown and her team at Holy Trinity Church in South Street offer practical and emotional comfort and support to those in need.    It cost £28 000 to run the shelter last year. The tight budget means manager David Perry is employed for just 13 hours a week  but he dedicates many more to reaching out to homeless people as soon as the team become aware of their difficulties.    Rev Brown said: ""We are unable to open all year round because the number of volunteers we would need would be phenomenal. We would need a huge amount of money to pay a full-time manager and we just don't have it.""    However  with the help of up to 300 volunteers  they are able to offer a safe haven each night during the worst of the winter for up to 12 guests.    Rev Brown is anxious that the help offered is more than a temporary sticking plaster.    ""Once we open we will keep going to the end of March – we have a very long season  one of the longest [of any winter night shelter] "" she said.    ""Experience tells us that the worst of the bad weather comes later than it used to. But we use that time to be able to work with people and to help people connect and reconnect. We need the time to build up the trust and the love that's required to be able to work with someone.    ""Just providing a roof over somebody's head does not resolve the challenges they are facing. It's just the beginning. The shelter is a conduit to other resources – to housing  to drug and alcohol rehabilitation and even using the contact centre to reconnect people to their children and families "" she said. That support continues even when guests are off the street.    As part of its mission to provide the best possible services  the shelter is regularly inspected by Housing Justice and was rated 'excellent' at the last visit. ""We are very proud of that "" said Rev Brown. ""We work very closely with Housing Justice and we follow all their guidelines.""    Each day  the shelter  now a registered charity  needs two overnight volunteers each night  three lunchtime and four evening helpers  plus an extra pair of hands during the day to collect food donated by businesses. Those who can spare just a few hours to play cards or board games or just chat are very welcome.    David said: ""You don't have to know how to resolve someone's issues – just come and be a friend.""    He is training volunteers who have already come forward but is anxious to recruit more and set up induction sessions for them too.    Not all roles are client-facing – the shelter also needs help with laundry  housekeeping  pantry stock rotation and preparing meals on the premises each evening. New recruits to the catering crew have been busy securing food hygiene certificates.    Rev Brown said: ""It's wonderful to come in out of the cold and for the guests to smell home-cooked meals coming out of the kitchen.""    The shelter's doors open each night from 8pm and guests leave at 7.30am  unless the weather is particularly bad. Lunch is on offer from 11am until 2pm. The shelter offers activities such as art therapy as well as advice on issues including mental health and addiction.    Over the past five years  since the shelter first opened  the team have built up a wealth of practical experience and a network of experts who can help address the complex issues which lead to an individual living on the streets.    They work closely with Citizens Advice  Bishop's Stortford Food Bank at the Methodist church  alcohol and drug rehabilitation professionals and East Herts Council's housing options officer for rough sleepers.    The team also partner with other churches  such as the Salvation Army  which provides vouchers so shelter-users can pick their own clothes from the good cause's shop in South Street.    David has a small selection of garments so that anyone turning up in wet clothes can change into something dry  warm and clean  but because space is tight  the shelter is unable to store donations of clothes  which are best directed to the town's charity shops.    The shelter has ample supplies of towels and beddings and uses special fold-up beds  which can be cleaned easily.    It does  however  always welcome donations of tea  coffee and biscuits  which are always in short supply  plus books and games for the guests.    Rev Brown said: ""The shelter has galvanised the community to meet what is an increasingly challenging issue for everybody. We could not do this without the support of the town.""",False

The Home Office have refused to help him pay their extortionate application fee so that Olusegun can join Glenford in the UK – we need £2523 to reunite this father and son.     Glenford Knight came to the UK from Jamaica at the age of 9. He grew up in Brent  worked for London Transport  and then trained in Computer Studies  after which he launched his own successful business. His whole life was here.     In 1996  Glenford travelled to Jamaica for what was supposed to be a 3 week holiday  but found himself trapped in Jamaica when he was prevented from returning to the UK  even though his passport had a ‘No Time Limit’ stamp. Suddenly  he was homeless  jobless  and separated from his family. After experiencing destitution and a severe deterioration in his mental health  he managed to start to rebuild his life in Jamaica and had two children  Gemma and Olusegun. Gemma is now 22 and Olusegun is 16.     In November 2018  Glenford was contacted by the Windrush Task Force  having been identified as a victim of the Windrush Scandal. He was initially told that his children  who were 20 and 15 at the time  would be able to return to the UK with him. However  after further communication with the Home Office  he was told that this would not be possible. He made the heart-wrenching decision to travel to the UK and make arrangements for his teenage son Olusegun to come and join him once he had arrived.     Glenford arrived in the UK in May 2019  and instructed solicitors to apply for entry clearance for Olusegun to come to the UK. But there was no way that he could afford the extortionate Home Office application fee of £1523  or the cost of Olusegun’s flight to the UK from Jamaica (around £1000). Glenford is unable to work due to a diagnosis of severe PTSD  brought on by the harrowing experience of being caught up in the Windrush Scandal and his separation from his son. He receives Universal Credit  and the vast majority of his monthly payment goes towards his housing and utilities bills  leaving him with just £50 a month to live off. He depends on food banks to feed himself.     Glenford has submitted a claim to the Windrush Compensation Scheme  but it is well documented that the Home Office is taking months or even years to settle claims: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/windrush-compensation-payout-delay-home-office-a9692251.html. Waiting for his claim to be settled before bringing Olusegun home would mean waiting indefinitely.     His solicitors made an application for an exceptional emergency payment under the Windrush Scheme to cover the cost of the application fee and flights. But this was refused by the Home Office on the basis that the request was ‘neither sufficiently urgent nor exceptional’ to warrant a grant. In the words of Glenford  ‘if my situation isn’t exceptional  I don’t know what is’.    His solicitors have lodged an application for Judicial Review of the refusal to grant an emergency payment. But he is still waiting for the High Court to grant permission for the case to go to a full hearing. Even if permission is granted  it could be over a year before the case is heard  and the outcome is uncertain.     The effect of this prolonged separation is having a devastating effect on both father and son. Glenford calls Olusegun every day; they are desperate to be reunited.     We need your donations to bring Olusegun to the UK so that he can be with his father  where he belongs.",False

Despite the UK being the sixth wealthiest nation  there are 4 million children living in poverty. Disadvantage is prevalent in Stoke  which as an area  is characterised by high levels of deprivation - statistically we are ranked as the 13th most deprived local authority in England.   This along with the ever growing inequalities between the rich and poor is something which we feel deeply passionate about addressing. Unfortunately we can not fix the systematic failings for the reasons why children are being failed  however  we can try our best to offer help and support to those most vulnerable in our communities.  Food poverty in 2020 should not exist and is our wish to promote humanity in whatever way we can.  We have created this group in order to kindly ask for donations of perishable food items and toys that will go towards helping families who are less fortunate and struggling in Stoke on Trent. The support fund will be running from One Bomb Boxing on King Street in Longton (opening tbc)  where families can come and receive any essential items they may need. Discretion is assured and any contact will be confidential. We welcome referrals for families who may not be able to reach us  drop offs can be arranged if necessary. We will be running a food bank and toy bank (we know Christmas may be a financially stressful time  especially given the pandemic). Opening times and dates to be confirmed. If anyone can make any kind donations or even volunteer to help out with the running of the support fund  it would be greatly welcomed. Please give us a like  share with your family and friends and help us support the most vulnerable families living in our city ❤️  Please share this page and donations of toys  food and your time would be most valued.

I am asking all my friends and family to donate whatever you can in urge to help those who need it in these tough times  especially with the free school meals not being continued over the holidays. If you wish to even collect one or two extra things whilst out shopping and bring them over that would be amazing as well!

Our group welcomes members from the areas we cover. Members are a combination of volunteers and vulnerable residents who require assistance at this time. Our volunteers provide emergency short term support to those affected and who may be classed as vulnerable either health wise or who have become financially challenged as a result of the lock down situation.    We cover Creswell and surrounding villages and we have also established our own local food bank to enable us to respond in emergency situations.    Our group  now formed  fully intend to maintain a presence within our community to serve the vulnerable on an ongoing basis after the current COVID-19 pandemic is over.    We have had many offers of cash from people we have helped so have created a place where donations can be taken so we can continue and expand our community work.    Visit our Website  https://communityunityproject.co.uk          Thanks for taking the time to read about the work we do and any donations no matter how large or small will make a huge difference to carrying on what we have started.

Our plan is to have a refill shop run by the community and by people who have special education needs.       The refill shop will be run as a charity to keep the food prices competitive with local supermarkets  which would mean everyone can afford to shop plastic free helping the environment.        The only people that will get paid for their work are the ones volunteering with S.E.N. the general volunteers will be working for good will and to help the community. All money that is not put back into the buisness will go to local and environment causes.       We will also have a recycling center in our courtyard for everything that cannot go in the local grey bins.       Working with local organisations and supporting the Rutland Food Bank by taking donations at the shop and donating things that are coming to the end of their sell by dates.   We really need your help and support to set this up and are asking for donations to help start our new and exciting community project. Any donation big or small will be very much appreciated and we will be offering vouchers to all that donate to spend in the shop when it opens.   Also if companies would like to donate we will put a small thank you sticker with their logo onto what we bought with their money (this will most lightly be a food storage box or storage tube).   If you think you could help in any other way please contact us. We need people to help set up the shop i.e. - help with fitting  painting  decorating etc. Also help with running the shop like book keeping  restocking  ordering  working on the shop floor.   Thank you for reading and if you can help us it would be so appreciated      Jenni and Rutland Refill team ",False
