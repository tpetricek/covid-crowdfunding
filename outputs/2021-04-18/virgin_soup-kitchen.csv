,"The Trussell Trust,Unit 9, Ashfield Trading Estate  Ashfield Road,Salisbury  SP2 7HL","The Trussell Trust","We support a nationwide network of food banks and together we provide emergency food and support to people locked in poverty, and campaign for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year. That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK. If you'd like more information or have any questions about fundraising please don't hesitate to contact us.
