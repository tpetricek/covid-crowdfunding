Bow Foodbank is a small independent foodbank based in Bow, east London. Our mission is to provide food and support to anyone in need.
We are fairly unique in our approach: the dignity of each client is foremost, they choose the food they need, and we don't require clients to be referred or have vouchers, prefering to trust each client. 

We provide a warm welcome, tea and a sandwich/cake while clients wait to do their 'shopping'. Free legal advice is available at each foodbank session.

EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by one full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.  
EFP operates 7 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme.
Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances.
Each food pack provides at least three meals for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave).
In 2018-19, we provided 11,495 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 19.6% increase on the previous year.
We were able to do so by receiving 130,000kg of food from public donations.
Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps.
Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres. 
Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.
