As a charity, we work to protect 500 years of history, inspire the next generation with the wonders of the natural world, make London a happier and healthier place to live and conserve precious wildlife.

Friends of Rwandan Rugby is a small, innovative charity which teaches the joys of rugby to boys, girls and young adults throughout Rwanda.  FoRR’s mission is  to promote the growth of participation in all forms of rugby and to encourage a healthy, active lifestyle through rugby. We employ 6 rugby development officers who work in over 90 schools throughout Rwanda
Why Rugby?  Why Rwanda?
For all the gruesome statistics from Rwanda’s genocide – and there are many – perhaps the most sobering is that 96% of the child population at the time are thought to have witnessed the bloodshed first hand.  Now those children are helping to build a new Rwanda and for some one thing has made that unenviable task just a little easier:  Rugby
Rugby as a contact sport helps build very strong relationships & friendships.&nbsp; Players need to be friends with their team mates so they take care of you on the pitch.
FoRR focuses on teaching rugby to children and young adults in schools and communities across Rwanda.

We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year.
That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.
