Some initiatives include providing hot meals  food & household items  Christmas gifts & winter packs.     The Hussain Soup Kitchen is named in memory of Hussain (Peace be upon him)  the beloved grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him)  a man who stood for peace & humanity.    The current climate of Covid19 has created more challenges for the homeless & less fortunate. With your support  the Hussain Soup Kitchen can continue to provide for the less fortunate members of the Peterborough community on a regular basis throughout the year. Thanks for your support.    All donations  regardless of size  make a huge difference. Please help us make a difference in people’s lives     ’The most generous of people is the one who gives to those from whom he has no hope of return’ (Imam Hussain (Peace be upon him)).

5","Christmas is one of the toughest times of the year for lots of people. Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland. Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen feed people seven days a week and will now be able to buy pallets of fresh produce to cook with  whilst the foodbank will be able to use the money to produce emergency three day food parcels.

If we hit our goal  I'll shave in a mullet and dye my hair blonde in honour of the one and only Mr Joe Exotic. ALL proceeds will go to Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen  as well as it being a proper good laugh.    The quiz will be hosted in full Joe Exotic attire.

The Soup Kitchen provide hot meals and warm clothes  drink and companionship in a warm and friendly environment on a weekly basis. Since 2013 we have served over 125 000 meals either eaten on site or distributed during food drop offs and outreach sessions around London and the UK.    Unfortunately for us the service was designed to maximise social contact for those most vulnerable in our communities who were feeling lonely  isolated and invisible. As a result of the current pandemic we have had to move away from that model and adapt it so as to limit social contact while still providing the basic essentials. This has meant that instead of having the centre open and serving hot food on site  we now have built up a database of vulnerable people (through both old and new referrals) and have been delivering both hot food  non perishables  freezer food  food packs and other essentials to those most affected by the current emergency. All our volunteers take precautions including wearing PPE and leaving parcels on the doorsteps"

It is deathly quiet and with no tourists spending money in our little village  the weeks or months (who knows!) ahead are going to get even tougher…  It is extremely difficult to help families and ‘choose’ who is more ‘in need’…   A large number of residents have been retrenched  restaurants have had to close  no curios  bracelets  cashew nuts  R&R’s or sim cards are being sold and there is currently not much hope on the horizon.    To create a SUSTAINABLE solution (and to try and be fair to everyone) we would like to open up a SOUP KITCHEN.  This will ensure that anyone who is hungry can get a nutritious meal  including a bread roll (pão) daily.  We aim to run this initiative for ±2 months when hopefully some type of 'normality' will return to Malongane.    This fundraiser will be overseen by the Malongane Community Association (a fully registered organisation) which will provide accountability and oversee exactly where the money is being spent. A full breakdown of costs will be published each week on their Facebook page.  The soup kitchen is being supported by a number of Malongane businesses (and individuals) who are donating their time  resources and skills to help put this together.    There are ±20 families in Malongane who are in desperate need. These families will be identified by the community via a community meeting and they will receive additional assistance where required.     Any donations towards our soup kitchen will be greatly appreciated.  We hope to welcome you back to Ponta Malongane very soon.    "

Vandals have targeted the home and vehicles of the founders of a mobile soup kitchen which have been serving the #Homeless  #SofaSurfers  those in temp accommodation  hostels and the #RoughSleepers in #Southampton. The community based project started by these 2 just over 5 years ago has built a strong team of #volunteers who go out and source donations  cook and prepare meals to help support around 50 people a day.       During the #Covid19 #Lockdown although we aren't allowed out on the streets  we are still preparing food and supplying the temp accommodation that the #roughsleepers are staying in during lockdown. Additionally food parcels have been distributed to those who needs it.    That said  we now cannot do anything since the tyres were slashed on the van and their own car. Additionally windows and doors were smashed on their car and the house windows had rocks thrown through them. The cook was also injured in this attack.     As a community based project  we are not a registered charity due to the small amount we raise financially. Most of our support comes from product donations. However we have been recognised by The #HighSheriffofHampshire and #RadianHousing for the work we do.       Funds raised will go towards new tyres and the insurance as no doubt it will increase next year. Any extra raised will all go towards the running if the soup kitchen. All funds raised  100% we recieve go to feeding the homeless. No volunteers or the founders are paid. We have no overheads except the van running costs and electricity to prepare the meals  everything else is covered by the volunteers and the donations of food.  "

It’s always been a passion of mine to raise money for a good cause and now might be a good opportunity to getting PPE equipment for our medical staff and care workers in the NHS. Also  I have heard stories about many working class parents who have lost their jobs during the recent pandemic and now have no means of buying food to support their families. I would like to raise money for ‘Shelter’ and ‘Soup Kitchens’ as it will benefit those directly.    So  I have set myself up for a 7 days challenge.  I will do a 2 mile run every day in different locations around Preston and Blackpool. I know  2 miles isn’t very far but as my knees are damaged from playing competitive badminton for nearly 35 years it will be a challenge for me. I will take photos along the route and snap shots of my location on google maps.    You can decide how your donation will be spent:-    Option 1: PPE for the medical and care workers  Option 2: Shelter and Soup Kitchen.    I can’t beat Captain Thomas Moore’s amazing achievement  I too applaud and thank him for the effort plus to those who support him  but I certainly will give it my best!"

A friend sent me a video of how one individual was making a big difference in the lives of children and adults in Zimbabwe by meeting this basic human need....food! I felt sad for the many individuals who were queueing to get some porridge and felt compelled to help. People are struggling in so many ways and with Covid-19  I can only imagine how people will survive! Only a person who has struggled or gone to bed hungry or watched their child starve would be the best person to tell the story...... Knowing that there are people rising up to help feed others who are really struggling at this difficult time is a step closer to lending a helping hand in such noble acts of kindness. However  we all know that one person cannot do it alone and that's where you come in to fit the missing piece of the puzzle...... There is power in unity and supporting each other to build a great nation! Thank you so much in helping raise money to feed those in need @Relief Kitchen (Samantha Muzoroki) and @With Love Foundation (Lynette Mahlaba)...

We wish to include local ethnic minority lawyers  businesses  students from local secondary schools and members of the public in a mock criminal trial dealing with the above issues.

The event is currently held at the Burford Sports Gym Studio and all funds raised will be awarded to the Liberty House Worship ministry soup kitchen.    ​The main goal is to raise £3k for the purchase of a food trailer.    The soup kitchen is led by Deacon Rui Machado and his wife  Mary. This service has been key to the feeding of the homeless community of Luton for the past ten years. ​Currently  the soup kitchen team meet once a week on Saturday 6 pm outside Connells Estate agents near Luton town hall.    Their community involvement has been essential  not only in providing food and drinks but also to be a necessary point of contact for other service providers that offers them vital services providers. These services provide them with essential information.    ​They can feed up to 40+ people each time. However  the mobile catering van will enable the team to manoeuvre out to feed those in need  living in the broader and surrounding communities.​    They would also benefit from having a better shelter during the poor weather and maximising the use of the kitchen facilities that come with it.​    ​Luton's Borough council has already announced that one of their objectives this year  is to tackle the problem of homelessness in the community. They too are in full support of the work of the soup kitchen  as well as other relevant charities and service providers within the community.    All funds raised will be presented for the soup kitchen team to use immediately.​ Recently  some of our gym members have been volunteering their services at the soup kitchen  which is why they are passionate to help raise funds needed to purchase the mobile catering van.​    We have been busy training hard in preparation for the event in March. We are attempting  to collectively Rep / Push and Pull a total weight of 300 000 kg in just 24 hours.    The aim for each participant  is to complete a five-stage circuit station consisting of 1) Barbell Squats  2) Deadlifts  3) Bench Press  4) Barbell Shoulder Press  5) Lat Pull-downs.    The individual Weight (kg)  Reps and Sets of each person  will be added and totalled at the end of the 24 hours.    The target Weight  Rep and Sets have been chosen to be physically challenging  but achievable in 24 hours. On average  most people will be lifting between 70-80% 1RM and hence rest time is essential for recovery in between exercise.    The average male will be aiming to lift a total of 35 200kg/rep and the average female will be aiming to lift a total of 12 400kg/rep within 24 hours.    Your sponsorship and donations will mean a great deal to us. Not only for a worthy cause but to help to motivate those taking part to achieve the end goal.    ​We will appreciate your support and thank you."

I am working towards becoming one of the first girls to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout. My Eagle project is a food drive for the Soup Kitchen London.  ​  About the Soup Kitchen:   The Soup Kitchen London  located on Tottenham Court Road  is a resource for the homeless  elderly  lonely and vulnerable in London. They provide free meals  clothing  toiletries and a sense of belonging to over 150 friends each day. Additionally  they provide an on-site therapist to address our guests' mental health needs. With the help of hundreds of volunteers each year  their aim is to provide a nutritious meal in a safe and warm environment that welcomes anyone who needs it.    Soup Kitchen serves two meals a day. The first meal consists of a takeaway bag (a social distancing effort) containing a sandwich  soup  yoghurt  porridge  a piece of fruit and a snack bar. The second meal consists of a nutritional and balanced hot lunch.   ​  Why I am fundraising:   Due to coronavirus  the Soup Kitchen London is one of the last organisations feeding the homeless in Central London. Four other organisations have had to stop their operations. The Soup Kitchen has lost a large amount of funding  donations and volunteers. Despite this  their number of guests have skyrocketed and more than 1/4 of their guests are new faces.    With the funds raised  I will purchase food supplies for the Soup Kitchen. Supplies like tinned vegetables  tinned beans  tinned tomatoes  pasta  butter porridge oats  dried herbs  stock powder  sugar  vegetable oil  salt/pepper  jam  peanut butter  tinned fruit  dried fruit and instant coffee/tea. The purchased food will be thoroughly sanitized and dropped off at the Soup Kitchen in a socially distanced way.    What you can do:   If you are able to donate £5 that would be amazing!

Feeling Strong MHC are an organisation who exist to make sure that every young person in Dundee who has experienced a mental health or wellbeing challenge is supported to reach their full potential. They deliver projects  services and campaigns in the community to tackle stigma  build confidence  develop resources  create networks and most importantly support the positive recovery journey of young people.

The Ju’/hoansi  the San people living in the Nyae Nyae Conservancy  now face a critical struggle against tuberculosis  a treatable and preventable disease.     This crowdfunder aims to raise money to support local efforts to beat this disease. The money raised will pay for projects which provide vital food  information and testing which is necessary to eliminate TB and support good recovery. The projects had a private funder  but she recently died  and government and NGOs have not picked up the funding shortfall. In addition  the collapse of tourism in the Nyae Nyae due to COVID19 has caused a major fall in local income  meaning this crowdfunder is more important than ever.       The San culture is under threat from many directions  but TB is particularly dangerous. It is the leading cause of death from any infectious disease worldwide and there are four strains of TB in the region. We’re working with organisations and doctors on the ground the Nyae Nyae to make sure this money gets to the right people at the right time.       The priority is to provide food for recovering TB patients as eating regular good food is essential for the treatment to work. Government funding pays for medicines distributed by the clinic in Tsumkwe  which serves the whole of the Nyae Nyae. However  this funding does not provide accommodation or food. There is a separate soup kitchen project which provides nutritious meals twice a day in Tsumkwe to TB patients  but it is facing massive funding cuts. The soup kitchen urgently requires £500 a month to continue to provide this vital service.     Funding is also desperately required for an outreach team that carries out testing and education in the remote villages. As we've learned from COVID19  testing is an important part of controlling infectious disease. The outreach team can identify the disease in the early stages  which limits the spread of infection within the villages. This outreach team requires £300 a month to operate.    Since TB flares up when people are malnourished or otherwise immuno-compromised  the longer term aim is to tackle food security. One vision to do this is to support the San to create gardens and food forests within each of the 39 villages in the Nyae Nyae Conservancy. Seeds  fencing materials and tree saplings are needed to establish a garden in each of them. If we exceed our fundraising target  the additional money will be put towards these gardens and forests.     If you are able to help fund this work in the longer term  please get in touch by contacting Caspar through the link below.       More on the San    The San people of the Kalahari are the last trace of our deep ancestry  our oldest cousins who never left Africa. Their territories span Botswana  Namibia and South Africa. In the last few centuries the nomadic lives these people led have been dramatically transformed through waves of colonialism and marginalisation that has put pressures on their land  and many are now settled in villages or only semi-nomadic.        Amongst the San are some of the best trackers and hunters in the world. Men and women can still walk into the bush with their digging sticks and come out with forage hides laden with food. However  their shrinking territory and the fact that they are settled in villages  means living off foraging and hunting alone is not enough. Money  necessary to supplement limited hunting and foraging  is hard to come by. The main sources of income are searching in the desert for the Devil’s Claw plant and tourism. With COVID19  it will be a long time before tourism returns to the Kalahari.     About us    We are a group of people passionate about supporting the Ju'/hoansi as many of us have spent time with them through the Old Way and / or Wildwise over the last few years. There is so much we can learn from a culture as old as humanity itself and we would love to support the people who shared so much with us. Your kindness means the world to us  thank you.

I hope you are all safe and well. Thank you so so much to everyone who has helped us reach our first target goal of ""£3000. We are so grateful and have put this money to such good use  with feedback from our homeless friends saying that the packages are so beneficial  protective and make a big difference! <3 <3 We are now setting a new target to double this money so we can keep doing the important work we are but also diversify to help out refugee services groups in the UK! Lots of love to everyone       Hi all  I hope this finds you  and everyone you love  safe and well supported. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak in the UK  new measures are being taken to limit the amount of mass gatherings and group meetings.    As a result  there is talk of soup kitchens  homeless shelters and regular meeting spots shutting  leaving some of our most vulnerable and at risk groups losing their regular access to designated food  shelter and safety spots; and social activities  leaving them without supplies and more isolated then ever before The creation of out-reach packages with non-perishable food and drink supplies  tissues  hand sanitation/wipes  and masks is essential  to supply to individuals who will now not be able to access these things in the places they could before. Moreover  as a medical student myself  we have been granted a large period of time without full academic commitments  where we have the time to go and make these deliveries and offer the support we can  during this time  where self-isolating isn't an option for some people.    Please donate whatever you can  and share this page with as many people as possible (especially those who work within larger companies and are able to circulate it around there). From there we can start to create packages and begin delivering them. Moreover if anyone has contact with food and/or supply companies who would be willing to ask for item donations  that would be amazing too.

Islay is a remote island of the West coast of Scotland with a population of 3500 people. The Covid-19 virus has hit island life hard with local businesses small and large having to close. The vulnerable and elderly are following Government guidelines meaning they are isolated in their homes . But  Islay is a strong community and we have over 80 volunteers that are helping to keep people’s physical and mental health strong by telephone befriending  collecting shopping  medicines and being a point of contact. Our newly formed resilience group coordinates the volunteers across the island reaching even the most remotest crofts and houses.        2.    We need a fund to:  Put fuel into the community bus  cover volunteer expenses  supply hand gel and gloves to our volunteers and eventually all households  and to cover admin and printing expenses. As the effects of the lock down persist  then we would like to provide people with a welfare box of essential items including food  kindling and toiletries.   Islay doesn't have access to mainland services so this fund is vital for us to get through the next few months.     3.    We visualise these funds being used in the immediate future for equipment to help the volunteers help the isolated but in the future weeks  we will need the fund to sustain the service and add a possible soup kitchen to enable the isolated to have two hot meals a day.    4.    The community of Islay  as we always do  has shown an excellent community spirit and will continue to pull together to ensure their neighbours who are isolated have everything they need to survive through this pandemic. Islay is resilient and will endeavour to push the barriers to make sure we will be open again for business as usual as soon as we can. This financial support will enable the immediate support of equipment  volunteers costs to be cover  offering hot meals to people at this hard time.    5.    You will be able to measure this through the huge smile and massive ‘socially distanced’ hug which comes through  helping a neighbour  friend or family member who is isolating and cant access their normal routine due to the pandemic. The number of volunteers is increasing every day  people as they have become unable to work have shown great support to help people who cannot leave their house. We will be forever in debt to the massive amount of generosity of time and supplies (physical and financially) from people and businesses. We hope we can open our doors to you all again very soon! Thank you in advance.    GC"

Amazing Graze is a soup kitchen providing meals and support to the homeless community in Blackpool. Part of Network Rail’s ‘Routes out of Homelessness’ charitable focus  the funds raised by the sleep-out will go directly towards helping to feed and support the homeless community in Blackpool. Chris is a relief signaller for Network Rail at Bamber Bridge  near Preston  with a passion for helping people living on the streets. When he’s not signalling trains  he can be found leading a team of volunteers who scour the streets of Blackpool looking for rough sleepers. He started his Thursday night ‘community watch’ street walks last year. Already he has up to 40 volunteers in tow  all decked out in Chris’ ‘United Blackpool' hoodies. Since starting his street walks  Chris has helped get 12 homeless people off the streets and into rented accommodation. He works with Blackpool charity Amazing Graze  running the local soup kitchen on Friday nights. Please email BlackpoolSleepOut@networkrail.co.uk for more information. "

We are aiming to raise £2000 in a short period of just two weeks to ensure that each and every family in Hartlepool who are in need of a little help at Christmas receive a Christmas gift. Can you imagine  as you sit at home this evening surrounded by your Children who have probably already written their Christmas lists and sent them off to Santa not receiving a single gift on Christmas morning? Unfortunately this is a reality for families in our home town but YOU can change that by making a donation. I am going to be working very closely with Childrens Services at Hartlepool Borough Council to ensure that we target families that are most in need. I may be slightly ambitious here but the hope is the target will be smashed and and any funds left over will be given to the local soup kitchen and food bank in their 'leaner' months of January and February.    A local business man who wants to remain completely anonymous came up with the idea of 'The Nothing But Love' campaign. Wanting to give something back for absolutely zero in return he wanted to give a £1000 of his own cash to go to local families who are in genuine need but without any 'thanks' or shouting from the rooftops just wanting to do a selfless  good dead. The idea of the 'Nothing But Love' Campaign was born.    So of course want to donate  right? Well  here is the catch - You give COMPLETELY ANONYMOUSLY. That's right  you get absolutely nothing in return other than the warm glow inside of knowing you have done a truly brilliant thing. We ask that if you donate to the page you just pop your initials in rather than your name. We like to think of it as people helping people. We are hoping that local business people will look to donate very generously. If you are unable to donate if you could share the Facebook page with anyone who you think may be able to support that would be very much appreciated.

Zimbabwe is not spared  having recorded our first case rising to 3 As we post this. We have one confirmed death  and one death is already one too many. We believe the numbers are more than this and its just a matter of time before the situation explodes. Our health system is broken and definitely not ready. But again we are called to ACTION  to help wherever we can. In most cases the homeless community is always ignored as already experienced. There has not been any awareness amongst this community  soup kitchens around town have closed down  they don't have any access to healthcare facilities. With the lockdown being effected by the government - do we even think of where they will go? What they will eat? And how will they get treated if they contract the virus.     As EatOut Movement and our big following of volunteers in Zimbabwe and globally we are stepping in to do something no matter how small.     We are asking you to please donate to our fundraising campaign  WE ARE ONE! We chose this name because this disease has no boundaries  race  religion or status. We are in this together and let's do our best to help those most vulnerable especially the homeless.     ~We also appreciate the frontline workers  they are amazing we call them angels because of the sacrifice they are putting by risking themselves.

We run Wakey Wakey cafe 52 Beverley road which provides     Free breakfast for rough sleepers in the morning and free tea  coffee  advice  activities and support throughout the day.    A food club for people on low income to purchase food at a much lower price  proofs of benefits or low income must be given.    Indoor Soup kitchens on certain nights.    We have also put rough sleepers up in hotels at Xmas for the past 2 years.    All money donated will go towards helping the above things happen and keep them going.    You can't just take someone from the street surrounded by people  put them in a room with just 4 walls and expect them to get on with it. We believe the best way to raise a roof is by giving support and gaining the trust to help people adjust when they get in a property.  doing this we have helped over 100 people off the street and into accommodation over the past 2 years.

Spin City Newbury actually closed before this request was announced as we felt the health and safety of our instructors and students needed to come first. As many can imagine  closing the doors to the business has been very difficult and emotional for us all. Unfortunately this has become even more difficult over the last few weeks when after exhausting all options available to us  it has become clear Spin City will not be entitled to any government help.     Spin City Newbury offers a range fitness classes including Pole  Silks  Aerial Hoop and Yoga  but Spin City is more than just a fitness studio. The studio offers a community where our students feel accepted. Students don't just come for the fitness classes  they come to meet new friends and take time away from the stress that is general life. Many students find that the studio helps their mental health and that the sense of achievement that naturally comes with our classes can help focus on a positive attitude towards health and fitness.     Spin City also has always possessed a strong desire to help the local community. Last year it held it's first summer ball where just short of £3000 was raised and donated to Mind  Berkshire Women’s Aid and Newbury Cancer Care. At the time of closing Spin City Newbury had just started organising this years ball with the intention of beating this huge amount. Along with this  Spin City regularly held Pole and Aerial 'jams' where students could come along after donating money to local soup kitchens/charities.     Katy and the entire Spin City team have always had a fiercely positive attitude  but at the moment the future isn't as positive. As a team we have started thinking of ways that we can adapt in these difficult and unprecedented times to allow us to get back into the studio teaching the classes our students love so much!    There are a few ways in which people can support and keep the studio alive.   There is the Spin City Patreon (Remember to put Spin City Newbury as your studio) This is pre recorded content that you can add together to build your own workouts. Memberships start at £10 per month and the proceeds are helping to support the studio while our doors are closed.   We will also be launching some specific classes which you can join in at home - details are being finalised at the moment  but we hope that this will bridge the gap for those wanting to workout at home but need a bit more motivation from an instructor for the class.   And lastly there is this crowd funder. This is aimed at anyone who would like to help support us  but isn't interested in getting lessons in return.   Anything you can donate is hugely appreciated and absolutely everything will be going into paying for the studio while we all are staying at home  staying safe and protecting the NHS.     From all of the team at Spin City Newbury - Thank you for your support."

They have been exploited  persecuted and displaced for many hundreds of years  and have experienced enormous hardship.    It has become increasingly difficult for the San Bushmen to continue to practice their traditional way of life as hunter-gatherers and now only fifteen active master trackers remain. The situation today is an urgent and critical one; we now have precious time left to help preserve this most ancient way of life and the wisdom they hold.     In March 2020 I will journey deep into the Kalahari Desert to this remote tribe with WildWise in association with The Old Way and CyberTracker. Our small group are all graduates from the WildWise “Call of the Wild ” programme and we will travel to the part of the desert which is the last place in Africa where they still retain rights to their ancestral lands  where they are still able to hunt with a bow and arrow and where the community still remain with some of their traditional ways of life intact.    Living among the Ju/‘Hoansi  we will immerse ourselves in their way of life  experiencing the way they live together in community  raise their children  and going out in small groups at dawn tracking with the bow hunting master trackers.       Why we need this original wisdom    Being the longest continuous intact human culture affords the San Bushpeople a unique intelligence missing in the modern world. They retain a deep inter-connection with the land and it gives them an exceptional and astounding ability to read the earth for stories and track and trail animals for days. This is a continuous tradition that goes back more than 100 000 years  the longest of any human tradition. Their skills and way of life are a vital source of information about human evolution and how to live in deep connection to the living world.    This older  deeper wisdom is lacking from our world right now but through it we might find the distant tracks of some of the answers to the profound questions and challenges the world is facing.    But just when we need it most  the opportunity to experience it is diminishing due to the long-standing persecution and displacement that the San have faced. This has made it impossible for the San to sustain this way of living.    It is my view that preserving this ancient culture that once supported all human life is as critical as saving the last 15 of any species on earth.     The time to act is now.    How the invitation came about    This invitation came from the Ju/‘Hoansi Bushpeople themselves. I am fully aware of the trap which many Western organisations fall into of thinking they know what’s best for other communities. Our primary guide is the renowned anthropologist  scientist and founder of CyberTracker Louis Liebenberg. Louis has been working with the Bushpeople in the Kalahari since 1985  and being a true master tracker himself is highly respected and trusted.    He was asked by the elders of the tribe in 1990 to help them to pass on their cultural practices to the younger generation who have abandoned the traditional ways of living because it is no longer a viable way to survive within the constraints forced upon them. Louis has been tirelessly working with the San Bushmen to ensure that their invaluable tracking expertise is passed on to the younger generation by reviving the ancient practice of tracking as a way to sustain life within the community.    By using free and easy-to-use software designed by CyberTracker  trackers are able to record complex data about wildlife populations and plant biodiversity. By becoming ‘qualified’ as trackers they are able to get jobs in ecotourism  as rangers in anti-poaching units  in wildlife monitoring and scientific research.    This programme of employment creation is vital to ensure that their invaluable tracking expertise is passed on to the younger generation of San by incentivising and motivating them to keep their knowledge and skills alive.        How the money will be used    1 - Money you offer will go directly to supporting the San communities. It will be a lifeline of employment for them whilst also encouraging them to continue their ancient and important cultural practices. This trip will support all the 15 remaining master trackers (three of whom are women!) in the Namibian conservancy for 4 months of the year. We pay them in one week what it takes them 2 or 3 months to earn picking the devil’s claw plant; which is their only other source of income. The tracking work provides a valued source of income which helps preserve their culture and unique scientific knowledge; The Tracker qualification programme in turn helps to support the livelihoods of the village as a whole.    2 - We will pay the other villagers such as the elders & youth who provide valuable knowledge and host us and help us with various tasks around camp.    3 - We also provide financial support through the purchase of handicrafts which provides a crucial source of income for the women as there is next to no potential employment for them in this region. This again supports a wide number of villages as well as helping them to preserve their heritage craft skills. The women will also be paid to teach us to build grass huts for us to sleep in which  like the handicrafts  provides a crucial source of income for the women as well as preserving the knowledge and skill set to build our species first kinds of homes.    4 - We pay an entrance fee to the conservancy  translators and apprentice translators.    5 - Subject to having enough money leftover and if external funds are not forthcoming from elsewhere then we will also provide funding for food for people coming to the TB soup kitchen in Tsumkwe  the clinic is thus able to stay open for longer and provide a better service; we supplement the funding of the clinic provided by others.     I will pay for my own travel to and from Namibia.    A thank you    I would love to offer you something tangible in return for your support. Therefore  I will be offering the following thank you for your donations:    - £50 or more: An invitation to an exclusive  small-group gathering around the campfire with me where I will share songs and stories from the desert. Date and venue TBC (most likely Gloucestershire)    - £10 or more: An invitation to a live Q&A (webinar/Facebook live) session with me on return from the expedition    My hopes and dreams    Whilst the money raised will deliver vital funding to support the San Bushpeople to continue their traditional ways of life. It is also my hope that there will be other benefits.    My own journey for the last few years has been one of a profound personal transformation and exploration into my own rewilding. It has unlocked for me an intense longing to be reminded of the wisdom that my ancestors held and their connection to their communities and the earth. What does it mean to re-wild ourselves and the communities we live in? Is it possible to bridge the modern world and all that it offers with an older  wilder way of being? How can I share this passion and this greater wisdom with others that crave a deeper connection with life? It is my hope that through this visit I will be able to bring back some of this wisdom and share it with you.    Thank you for reading! Please help in whatever way you can.    With deep gratitude and love     Jen xxx      WildWise     Outdoor environmental education based in the magical Dartmoor National Park in Devon. They offer a diverse programme of courses and events designed for adults  children and families  including the year-long “Call of the Wild ” programme that I attended back in 2017  which is where my journey really began.    The Old Way     If this is something you would like to personally experience and support  then it is possible to join a similar trip journeying into the Kalahari with “The Old Way” which is a year-long program exploring hunter-gatherer life ways which takes place in Devon and the Kalahari.    More about the San Bushpeople    It is thought likely that the Bushmen are the descendants of the ancestral source  from which all modern humans diverged as they started spreading around the world about 60 000 years ago. Their cultural practices date back 100 000 years - all human beings once lived in this original way. It still lives deep in all of us.    Like all indigenous cultures the San have been subject to long-standing persecution and pressures from all sides. It is extraordinary that the people and their culture has been able to persist. Hunter-gathering by its very nature relies on an ability to roam great distances to source the food they need. Today their ancestral lands are divided up into farms and given away to diamond miners; the small areas left ‘designated’ for the bushmen are not compatible with their way of life. They have been evicted  starved of food and water and hunted like animals. Most San have now been resettled to camps  where disease and alcoholism is rife. It is a far cry from their traditional ways that work in harmony with the land living in community. Something so many of us seem to be striving for today as a way out of the ecological crisis we find ourselves in.    Somehow  against the odds a small number of San Bushmen persist in living according to their ancient traditions. It is thought that the number is now around 10-15 individuals and this number is declining. It is very likely that if nothing changes their way of life will be lost forever in the next few years  a human extinction that will go unnoticed. I don’t want to sit passively to let that happen.    This is why new ways of supporting the San are vital  so that they continue to value their traditional ways  passing them on to their young people so that they might keep alive a culture from which all human life originated."

Hi all. I'd normally be working on the wards at our local hospital in Newbury (WBCH) but am currently in isolation due to previous medical problems that put me in the extremely clinically vulnerable group. I am therefore feeling a bit useless at the moment. I have done a little fundraising for the hospital as have a lot of people in this area so have now decided I'd like to raise money for our local soup kitchen in Newbury and also The Living Rainforest which due to it's closure to the public during this time  needs money to pay for the food and upkeep of their animals and birds.  People who know me know that my rather unruly hair is kind of like my trademark. I am recognised easily for it. Some people don't know however that I have been completely without hair due to treatment for leukaemia 29 yrs ago and that I have had 2 small trims in the last 20+ years as it takes FOREVER to grow. Hence my entering into this with some trepidation to say the least  that and due to the lock down  my partner Shaun will be doing the honours (Gulp!!).  Any money raised here will be split 50/50 between the 2 beneficiaries. I am raising it like this as The living Rain forest isn't a charity so I can't do it that way.  I hope you will support me by watching it as it's live streamed on facebook (if i can suss out how to do it by then!) as well as by giving generously so that Newbury Soup Kitchen can continue to support the local homeless people and so that the Living Rain Forest will still be there for you to be able to visit Cinnamon the Sloth and the other animals and birds when we are back to whatever ""normal"" is.   Thank you in advance.  Lynne XXX"

This is an emergency short-term appeal for donations to help keep the bellies of rough sleepers full during lockdown.    As many of you probably know  there's been a huge effort from local councils to rehouse rough sleepers in hostels around London over the last few weeks. This initiative  though wonderful in its intent to protect rough sleepers from Covid-19  has displaced many many people who called those streets their homes  who relied on a pound from friendly passers-by and who used to community resources in their area to get by. Due to the tightening of government guidelines around health & safety measures  a huge number of central soup kitchens and food distribution services have paused operations. Moreover  the majority of supermarkets have stopped accepting cash in this time.    In times of crisis  a person's core ethics are often exposed  and in the face of this pandemic  a massive number of people have offered their time to cook  prepare and deliver food. We have made contact with a number of hostels sheltering rough sleepers and as we understand it  those people will have no access to food until after the Easter bank holiday. Councils are underfunded and people's bellies are rumbling.    This is a call for financial aid to help our small team buy ingredients to cook some hearty meals for the next few weeks!    ***UPDATE***    This project has massively scaled up since last time I posted the appeal!!!! What started as an initiative to provide meals for rehoused rough sleepers over the Easter weekend has evolved into a daily food prep and delivery service in coordination with various councils across north/east London. The willingness of people to volunteer their time to shop  cook and deliver food has meant we've been able to commit to another 3 weeks operating. The only thing we need to push now is donations. The hostel we are working to support is housing rough sleepers as well as asylum seekers and its really important to us that we can provide meals for both these groups. Please  if you've got a little spare change  help keep this going as long as it's needed! And don't hesitate in contacting me if you want any more info"

They have been exploited  persecuted and displaced for many hundreds of years  and have experienced enormous hardship.    It has become increasingly difficult for the San Bushmen to continue to practice their traditional way of life as hunter-gatherers and now only fifteen active master trackers remain. The situation today is an urgent and critical one; we now have precious time left to help preserve this most ancient way of life and the wisdom they hold.     In March 2020 I will journey deep into the Kalahari Desert to this remote tribe with WildWise in association with The Old Way and CyberTracker . Our small group are all graduates from the WildWise “Call of the Wild ” programme and we will travel to the part of the desert which is the last place in Africa where they still retain rights to their ancestral lands  where they are still able to hunt with a bow and arrow and where the community still remain with some of their traditional ways of life intact.    Living among the Ju/‘Hoansi  we will immerse ourselves in their way of life  experiencing the way they live together in community  raise their children  and going out in small groups at dawn tracking with the bow hunting master trackers.       Why we need this original wisdom    Being the longest continuous intact human culture affords the San Bushpeople a unique intelligence missing in the modern world. They retain a deep inter-connection with the land and it gives them an exceptional and astounding ability to read the earth for stories and track and trail animals for days. This is a continuous tradition that goes back more than 100 000 years  the longest of any human tradition. Their skills and way of life are a vital source of information about human evolution and how to live in deep connection to the living world.    This older  deeper wisdom is lacking from our world right now but through it we might find the distant tracks of some of the answers to the profound questions and challenges the world is facing.    But just when we need it most  the opportunity to experience it is diminishing due to the long-standing persecution and displacement that the San have faced. This has made it impossible for the San to sustain this way of living.    It is my view that preserving this ancient culture that once supported all human life is as critical as saving the last 15 of any species on earth.     The time to act is now.    How the invitation came about    This invitation came from the Ju/‘Hoansi Bushpeople themselves. I am fully aware of the trap which many Western organisations fall into of thinking they know what’s best for other communities. Our primary guide is the renowned anthropologist  scientist and founder of CyberTracker Louis Liebenberg. Louis has been working with the Bushpeople in the Kalahari since 1985  and being a true master tracker himself is highly respected and trusted.    He was asked by the elders of the tribe in 1990 to help them to pass on their cultural practices to the younger generation who have abandoned the traditional ways of living because it is no longer a viable way to survive within the constraints forced upon them. Louis Liebenberg has been tirelessly working with the San Bushmen to ensure that their invaluable tracking expertise is passed on to the younger generation by reviving the ancient practice of tracking as a way to sustain life within the community.    By using free and easy-to-use software designed by CyberTracker  trackers are able to record complex data about wildlife populations and plant biodiversity. By becoming ‘qualified’ as trackers they are able to get jobs in ecotourism  as rangers in anti-poaching units  in wildlife monitoring and scientific research.    This programme of employment creation is vital to ensure that their invaluable tracking expertise is passed on to the younger generation of San by incentivising and motivating them to keep their knowledge and skills alive.      How the money will be used    1 - Money you offer will go directly to supporting the San communities. It will be a lifeline of employment for them whilst also encouraging them to continue their ancient and important cultural practices. This trip will support all the 15 remaining master trackers in the Namibian conservancy for 4 months of the year. We pay them in one week what it takes them 2 or 3 months to earn picking the devil’s claw plant; which is their only other source of income. The tracking work provides a valued source of income which helps preserve their culture and unique scientific knowledge; The Tracker qualification programme in turn helps to support the livelihoods of the village as a whole.    2 - We will pay the other villagers such as the elders & youth who provide valuable knowledge and host us and help us with various tasks around camp.    3 - We also provide financial support through the purchase of handicrafts which provides a crucial source of income for the women as there is next to no potential employment for them in this region. This again supports a wide number of villages as well as helping them to preserve their heritage craft skills. The women will also be paid to teach us to build grass huts for us to sleep in which  like the handicrafts  provides a crucial source of income for the women as well as preserving the knowledge and skill set to build our species first kinds of homes.    4 - We pay an entrance fee to the conservancy  translators and apprentice translators.    5 - Subject to having enough money leftover and if external funds are not forthcoming from elsewhere then we will also provide funding for food for people coming to the TB soup kitchen in Tsumkwe  the clinic is thus able to stay open for longer and provide a better service; we supplement the funding of the clinic provided by others.     I will pay for my own travel to and from Namibia.    My hopes and dreams    Whilst the money raised will deliver vital funding to support the San Bushpeople to continue their traditional ways of life. It is also my hope that there will be other benefits.    My own journey for the last few years has been one of a profound personal transformation and exploration into my own rewilding. It has unlocked for me an intense longing to be reminded of the wisdom that my ancestors held and their connection to their communities the earth. What does it mean to re-wild ourselves and the communities we live in? Is it possible to bridge the modern world and all that it offers with an older  wilder way of being? How can I raise my children with this greater wisdom  in a community that thrives and supports one another? It is my hope that through this visit I will also find wisdom to bring back to my life  my children and the communities I live and work in.     Thank you for reading! Please help in whatever way you can.    With deep gratitude and love     Elena xxx      WildWise    Outdoor environmental education based in the magical Dartmoor National Park in Devon. They offer a diverse programme of courses and events designed for adults  children and families  including the year-long “Call of the Wild ” programme that I attended back in 2017  which is where my journey really began.    The Old Way    If this is something you would like to personally experience and support  then it is possible to join a similar trip journeying into the Kalahari with “The Old Way” which is a year-long program exploring hunter-gatherer life ways which takes place in Devon and the Kalahari.    More about the San Bushpeople    It is thought likely that the Bushmen are the descendants of the ancestral source  from which all modern humans diverged as they started spreading around the world about 60 000 years ago. Their cultural practices date back 100 000 years - all human beings once lived in this original way. It still lives deep in all of us.    Like ll indigenous cultures the San have been subject to long-standing persecution and pressures from all sides. It is extraordinary that the people and their culture has been able to persist. Hunter-gathering by its very nature relies on an ability to roam great distances to source the food they need. Today their ancestral lands are divided up into farms and given away to diamond miners; the small areas left ‘designated’ for the bushmen are not compatible with their way of life. They have been evicted  starved of food and water and hunted like animals. Most San have now been resettled to camps  where disease and alcoholism is rife. It is a far cry from their traditional ways that work in harmony with the land living in community. Something so many of us seem to be striving for today as a way out of the ecological crisis we find ourselves in.    Somehow  against the odds a small number of San Bushmen persist in living according to their ancient traditions. It is thought that the number is now around 10-15 individuals and this number is declining. It is very likely that if nothing changes their way of life will be lost forever in the next few years  a human extinction that will go unnoticed. I don’t want to sit passively to let that happen.    This is why new ways of supporting the San are vital  so that they continue to value their traditional ways  passing them on to their young people so that they might keep alive a culture from which all human life originated."

My mum and I are creating food hampers for people in the nearby community of Masiphumelele who have no food  and no income at the moment during our Coronavirus Lockdown. The lockdown is preventing any work for them  and its not easy (near impossible) for them to access anything from the system. There are millions of people here who are in the same situation so its very difficult.    We have been creating weekly essential food hampers for 14 Zimbabwean Families who are not receiving anything from anyone. They all have 4-6 people to feed in each household (sometimes more) and they have no income at all coming in. Winter is approaching  and while we sit inside at our warm fireplaces with full tummies  they are going to be in a very different reality. The families so far are all friends with the guy who works full time for our family. He is Zimbabwean and lives on our property  so he is safe  paid and fed well of course. We asked him a few weeks ago if he had friends/knew any other people directly who were going to be really without food  and he identified 11 Zimbabwean contacts. It grew to 13  and now 14 and while we will continue to do this for them  we would like to grow and be able to a) give them a bit more in their hampers to make it a real good week’s supply  and b) to increase it ultimately to 20 families that we can support. Our focus at the moment is on the Zimbabwean families who are having a very hard time accessing some of the soup kitchens/food parcels  and we acknowledge that this a problem for many other nationalities and groups. My mum is from Zimbabwe  so its a cause close to her heart.    We know there are always more people  but if we can just start with a few  then at least that is making a small difference.     This lockdown life is a very different reality for everyone. Lots of us are worried about not being able to exercise properly  worried about eating too much from our overstocked fridges and pantries  burning our banana breads  and getting bored of the Netflix offerings.     Others are literally struggling to survive.     Any donations that we receive will be spent directly on creating essential food hampers  to increase what we are already contributing ourselves. We will distribute directly to these people once a week. (We have organised transport for it to be delivered directly to them  and I receive photos and messages of thanks from all the families)    We have a VERY weak exchange rate here in SA  so I appeal especially to my friends living outside SA- to donate even a little bit  as here it can go a very long way! Maybe its your saving of daily Starbucks/Costa Coffees that you aren’t able to buy anymore  or the savings of not going to the pub :) or maybe is just your generous nature  that will be very appreciated!      To feed a family of 4 with very basic weekly supplies  can be done with R200-R250  which works out to approx 9-12Pounds per hamper. (would also be good to increase the contents/value to broaden the variety and quantity). The more we can raise  the more families we can feed  and we can also hopefully help them with a little bit of money for electricity for their houses  which is another big problem! We need to continue this for the foreseeable future  as we don’t know how long we will be in various levels of lockdown and until they will be able to find some work to support themselves again  so we really will appreciate all donations to be able to sustain and importantly  to grow this.   Its never-ending...    We have also made and distributed fabric masks to these families and others  as its now law to have to wear masks in public. The mask production continues (my mum and her friends) and we will keep donating these to as many people as we can. They are using old cotton fabric that they have either been hoarding for years  or upcycling spare linen into masks.      Thank you very much for your time.   Stay Safe and Healthy.    Philippa    x"

The threat of Covid-19 is still here and will not disappear immediately. The UK currently has the second highest death rate from this virus in the world  so we need to make sure that we are still acting responsibly to protect ourselves and others. Not forgetting the fact that we are still uncertain as to whether a second peak will befall us  which has been the case in previous fatal viruses. As everyday life continues  we just will need to adapt to a new way of operating and interacting with those around us.    Bridging the gaps:    As lockdown eases  it is becoming more and more apparent that there are sectors that do not fall under the government’s priority list. These keyworkers are required to go back to work to support the economy and keep their families thriving. We would like to help them achieve this without any additional anxieties.    Approximate pricing for PPE is as follows:        Standard surgical mask £50 for 50    KN95 Mask £120 for 50    Disposable gloves (med grade) £45 for 100     Shoe covers £25 for 100 pairs    Disinfectant wipes (med grade) £25 for 1000    Antibacterial gel (alcohol based) £90 for 5 litres    Protective goggles £15.00    Face shield £10    Desk screen £50 - £150 (size depending)        What will we be doing?    With funds raised  we will be providing the ‘forgotten key workers’ with PPE so that they feel secure in their place of work. These include supermarket staff  transport workers  support workers  social care staff  delivery and logistic staff including food/sustenance providers who have had no choice but to continue working to support us and their families. They are often overlooked but have a major impact on how well our society continues to operate.    Who are we?    We are “can't STOP fashion”  a fashion with a purpose movement with a remit to address the issues at the forefront of society. This is accomplished through the collaboration of undiscovered and underrated talent from the fashion  media and entertainment industries. We hope to bring pressing social issues to audiences who often do not to indulge in mainstream media platforms  alongside showcasing these up and coming creatives with a purpose.        Quarantine Fashion Show:    Promotional Trailer Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDcel5r01jQ    To kickstart this PPE campaign  we have started with the “Quarantine Edition” fashion show which will be premiered globally on Sunday 31st May 2020. The project was put together whilst adhering to the UK government's guidelines regarding Covid-19 and social distancing; this was inclusive of risk assessments to ensure the health and safety of the team and contributors was upheld at every turn. The premiere will be available on YouTube Instagram TV - Instagram/YouTube: @CantStopFashion_Official            If the target is surpassed:    If the target funding is surpassed  our aim is to expand our attention to other organisations  charities or settings at risk from unnecessary exposure that would also benefit from assistance to protect themselves (e.g. homeless shelters  soup kitchens  public sector cleaners  public transport staff and other “customer facing” services).

Due to Covid-19 we did not get to the end of March and found ourselves without a building to carry on supporting the guests of our WNS. Determined to still support the homeless  I looked for a building to carry on this vital service. Before I knew it the other churches also began to stop their service due to covid-19  it now became imperative to find a building that could cater for 7 nights a week. My generous friend  Victoria Holder  was able to lend us a building she uses for Eco Wings in Short Street. Committed to making this a success  I created a management team of Hannah Tull  Cheryl Bertschi and Lucy Watts (Street Spirit) to ensure that we were successful making this a realty.  We were off and running within a matter of a days. With so many committed volunteers helping us to move venues and set up our new place of peace and a vital shelter for our guests. Thanks To St Vincent de Pauls  Brentwood Lead  Elaine Heywood who helped to fund the programme and some financial support from Street Spirit  we were able to get this started.  Yes! We had achieved this 7 night a week shelter for our guests  with Hannah our Volunteer coordinating seeking volunteers from all 7 churches and soup kitchen  and Cheryl and Lucy coordinating the food. We didn’t stop there as we increased our service by providing an outside takeaway service which Street Spirit  One Love and the soup kitchens supported us in doing.  Then came the closure of night shelters due to the Southend Borough Council housing all the rough sleepers in Hotels. This was amazing but could we shut shop. NO  they all needed feeding. So within hours  we were able to readjust and now coordinate a takeaway service to feed the 100 rough sleepers with Cheryl coordinating the food and Hannah reorganising our volunteers.  So here we are at Short Street today continuing to feed the rough sleepers in their hotels 3 nights a week and the vulnerable people 7 days a week.  Thank you to our amazing TEAM who unconditionally support this cause and have brought LOVE into our community!! Thanks for Turning Concern into Action."

Amongst other things they organise regular soup kitchens. At tonight's soup kitchen a mother and her two children   both still in their school uniform attended . They are currently staying in a B&B through no fault of their own . They are not on benefits so they are without money  and out of options. Please   if you can donate anything . We can work together to get her a deposit for a home for her family.    I have two children asleep upstairs.  Safe  used to their familiar surroundings. Only having to worry about whether they ll have shreddies or porridge for breakfast in the morning. Not whether they will eat  not wondering what all those weird noises are at the bedsit. Let's do this and help them .    It's hard being a mum   and that's when you have everything you need. Imagine this.    We ve got your back lady :)   https://www.hopeforfood.org.uk/"

In order too keep soup kitchens running  food banks fully stocked. Warm winter clothing and sleeping bags. A safe place for them to come and receive support and socialise with others. With this money it allows charities to provide more equipment and and give people in need the quality of life they deserve. I haven’t chosen one charity in particular as I couldn’t possible decide which one. I will be doing as much volunteer work as possible. Funding is stretched and we are running out of resources. These people are physically dying or suffering with mental illnesses and if we can donate a tiny amount it makes a difference. Try and imagine if it was you in this position.

As an independent volunteer here in Greece the most important thing I've been able to do is provide aid in crisis situations exactly at the time it was needed. That is why it is very important for independents to be here. To fill in gaps. You see NGOs  because of the way they are set up  although they have the funding and the resources  their hands are tied by a million different rules and regulations  which stops them from being able to react quickly to crisis.         But independent volunteers work differently. They arrive  they assess the needs and they provide direct aid as and when it is needed. This can mean doing a midnight run to the super market and buying 2000 croissants because the borders are closed and 80 buss loads of hungry and cold people are stuck at a gas station. Or driving a van full of equipment  for 6 hours   to set up a portable soup kitchen next to said gas station. It means arriving at 4am with tents and sleeping bags  making sure children and vulnerable people don't sleep in the open air in the middle of winter. It means being able to fly a very sick child to a mainland hospital in the middle of the night. And so much more.         But for this to happen we need funding. Money that can be accessed immediately. We need to be able to respond quickly. And we need your help. After nearly 3 months here I have had the absolute privilege of meeting and working with some of the most incredible human beings for whom personal safety and comfort is secondary to the welfare of others. They don't stop. They work 17 hour shifts in the cold or the heat  at the beaches  at the borders  in the towns. They pitch tents in the middle of a field with a gas cooker and make tea or soup  anything to provide warmth and comfort. They take over abandoned buildings and renovate it and turn it into safe spaces where people can eat and sleep and get much needed relief from their relentless suffering.         If you think this work is important and would like to offer your support  please donate generously. Tell your friends and family about it. It's because of your care and trust in us that we are able to do what we do.                                             What we need money for:    To hire vans  we need to buy kitchen equipment  food  blankets  sleeping bags  tents and everything else people need to survive the cold and the inhumane conditions forced on them by this situation.      100% of your donation will go toward providing relief to the refugees. We do not discriminate between war refugees and economic migrants. We do not differentiate between different nationalities. We only priorotise based on who has the greatest need.      For more info  updates or if you want to contact us go to: www.facebook.com/TheRefugeeTrail/        I thank you in advance for your kindness and generosity.       Sincerely    An independent volunteer"

Thank you for showing some interest in my wild adventure.     In November I will be challenging myself to complete the 11 day and night Everest Base Camp Trek (key word challenge :P) with https://www.adastraadventures.com/everestbasecamp and I am taking this opportunity to raise and donate funds to the amazing charity: The Soup Kitchen   http://amchurch.co.uk/soup-kitchen/    The Soup Kitchen is a resource in central London for the homeless  lonely  elderly and vulnerable. Operating since 1986  they feed and clothe over 100 people each day.  In June  they launched Europe’s first mental health drop-in centre  located within a soup kitchen. Their goal is to address some of the core issues of homelessness and help people get back to a more normal living environment.     For many years  my beautiful Mum has had a very rough ride battling many problems that fall under the topic of Mental Health. Raising awareness and putting my energy into this cause is something that ultimately makes me feel like I am helping in some way as you can feel so helpless a lot of the time.     Just over a year ago I held an event to raise awareness for the New Zealand Mental Health Foundation and we raised $5000 . This event helped open my Mum's eyes to a whole new world of love and support and with that I am so grateful for what we raised for charity.  You can watch a little glimpse of my event below:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7R3kzRc8sQ    This year it is for The Soup Kitchen because of the services they offer to those who need it most.   I’ve volunteered at The Soup Kitchen cooking  serving food and  more importantly  socialising with the homeless  which is just as crucial. The nature of sleeping rough means that not many people stop to have a conversation with you and it makes people feel so isolated.     There are many charities out there that you just don't know where your money is going when you donate. With the Soup Kitchen  you literally see where it is going.     In saying all of this  I will be volunteering at The Soup Kitchen leading up to my climb to Base Camp  and I will document it on my instagram ( janamay_xo ) for you to see what goes down at The Soup Kitchen. All of my hiking gear that I will be taking including my sleeping bag  thermals  shoes - everything  will be donated to the homeless at the Soup Kitchen when I return.     The love and support from you means the absolute world to me as it puts my heart and mind at ease knowing that I am doing at least something to help when opportunities arise.    Help me make a huge difference for the people of London who sleep rough every night and battle mental health issues on a daily basis.    *brace for cheeziness*  If I could move mountains for my Mum I would  but I can't. (I'm strong  but not that strong :p ) so instead I will climb them.     So  following in the fellow Kiwi Sir Edmund Hilary's footsteps...    Mt Everest  I'm ready for you!    Thank You So Much <3"

She has also lost a good part of her short term memory. Joan is confined to a wheelchair as she can not walk on her own. She has a caregiver who comes daily to care for her.     Sadly Joan has just been forced into homelessness and is temporarily living in a motel in Kelso  Washington. This happened just after Christmas because she was short rent money but didn’t want to ask for help as it was Christmastime. Sadly she was evicted and didn’t realise the implications and the cruelness the landlord would show them. Now she will have great difficulties finding a landlord that will accept her because that eviction is on her record.     My nephew Joshua  who has learning difficulties  also lives with my sister. Joshua takes care of his mom at night when her caregiver is not able to be there. He also has a job at the local McDonalds that he's very proud of as it's so hard for him to get a job with his difficulties. Unfortunately  because Joshua is an adult  he was made to be on the lease for the apartment as well. This means unfortunately that the eviction is on his record too.     Joshua’s young son  my great nephew Oliver  lives with them as well. He’s a bright kid that is the star football player for his school. Oliver helps look after his grandma too and he just adores her.     The three of them are sharing a handicap room and sadly the boys are sleeping on the floor.     Becoming homeless  let alone my sisters stroke  has affected them all something terrible and they are stuck! They are good people who’ve never drank  smoked or been anywhere near drugs.   My sister and nephews are the kind of people who would give you the shirt off their backs.     My sister was a stay at home grandma. She’s raised my great nephew Oliver when he was abandoned by his mother at 3 months old.   Joan used to make cookies and bake all the time and boy could she crochet! Her blankets and scarves were so beautiful!   She also used to volunteer at a local church who ran a soup kitchen. That came to an end when she fell off a pallet in 2014 whilst volunteering and broke her hip! Only a few months after this she had her stroke. Joan has had a horrible run of luck and I just want to turn it around for her and really show her how much everyone cares!     My sister receives very little help from the state and doesn’t get housing just because she’s a disabled stroke victim as most would assume. My great nephew is obviously a minor but the government doesn’t provide quick assistance for this reason either unfortunately.     They have applied to the local housing authority for subsidised housing but the waiting list is two years! Things are so different in the USA compared to the UK. The government WILL NOT help them!     We have exhausted all efforts  called all the shelters and spoken to the local churches. It seems so many people are in this position in the USA that no one has the ability to help!     Please help raise money for Joan and my sweet nephews to have a safe place to stay for the time being. The money will be going towards keeping them in the handicap room for now so my sister can be comfortable and close to her caregiver. Any additional money will be saved for a deposit for an appropriate home for them and any essentials they require.     If anyone knows of a landlord in Kelso or Longview that is willing to help them please let me know. We really need a miracle to happen! With your support and spreading the word hopefully we can find something for them soon!     Anything you can give now will be much appreciated. Even £5! Please share with everyone you know! Thank you all so much in advance!"

I graduated in tourism management from Greenwich university in 2012. I have 7 years experience in the charity sector as a fundraiser. I have always been passionate about social issues that affect people and always wanted to change the world in some way or another. Growing up in southeast London  I was confronted with many challenges such as; racism  classification  social disparities and gang violence. Those issues are still relevant today. Last year  there was two stabbings in my area and a close friend of mine was a victim of knife crime. These events lead me to believe  that more needs to be done as a community and action needs to happen now.     For most of us  we climbed trees  rode bikes  and played outside. At the time  there was more facilities and support network for our generation  despite the deep rooted existence of crime within ethnic communities and the lack of opportunities as a result of economical and social inequalities in the 90s and early 00s. Nowadays  there seems to be so many relevant tools to be utilised  however the lack of guidance prevents young people to aspire greater. In this day and age youth are forced to grow up faster than their age and that safety net is no longer there. In order to meet the demand of this new generation  this is why it inspired me to create 'Perception2life'    Perception2Life is a community driven organisation that aims to tackle knife and gun culture through education  training  development and free creative programmes for the underprivileged youth. While sharing resources to grass root organisations  homeless shelters and small charities helping children across the UK. During the holidays we aim to recruit school  college  and university students to work with us to gain experience and skills to put on there CVs for future work.We are now at stage to set up and run  art workshops  music lessons  mentoring sessions and parenting classes.     Although we have been registered for one year  we have only fully been in operation since January 2018. In  South Bank  Strand  Covent Garden  Soho  Oxford Circus) Assisting Street Link  The Salvation Army Centre  providing clothes  toiletries and sleeping bags to rough sleepers in Reading  we also worked with Waggy Tails which aid young people with autism at the Emmanuel Centre in Croydon. On November we donated to Brixton soup Kitchen as they do amazing outreach programmes for the homeless. Currently we have sent through a proposal to Trinity Laban Conservitour for building space to start free classical music classes  after biding to get space in November we got 'The Bridge'  in Pleasants Park  East Greenwich  where in march we run our first 'Reflective Art Programmes'  to tackle social anxiety and depression.     For more information please check our social media platforms:    Facebook: Perception2Life Youth of Today and Tomorrow  Instagram: Perception2Life_Youth      Our vision is to change a young person's mental capabilities  through training and development  by providing education programmes  aimed to tackle anxiety  low self esteem and confidence. We are in the process of reaching out to local councils to assist with funding  creating awareness through means of marketing.     We are only funded by the public and hold fundraising community events and BBQs to gain contributions to donate to chosen organisations and youth programmes. We also have a team of fundraisers that are sent out in different parts of London to do outreach  create awareness and raise funds from the community which are then used to cover our project’s costs such as space rent  art supplies  webite  logo  and app design  sports equipment merchandise and stovk and classroom utensils  clothes and utensils for homeless youth and orphanages etc.     Target funding is £50 000 but £25000 will aid in making our youth projects bigger and better.    Despite all our efforts  there is still so much we can do as a community regardless of your social status and ethnic background  we need your support through donation and sponsorship to ensure a better future for our youth of today and tomorrow.    ""It takes one person to make a difference but it takes a nation to create change"".    ""We might be one rain drop  but if we all came together  we will create a tidal wave to wash this problem away"".    ""Where focus goes energy flows"".    “Each one Teach one”. ❤️❤️"

We have been offered a Pre- Owned Land Rover in very good condition for a very reasonable price of R50 000 (£3 000) For those who don’t know  a vehicle like this even second hand does not usually go for less than £7-8 000. The current owner (selling to us) has discounted the rest as a donation to a worthy cause  on condition we can raise the rest of the funds. The vehicle will be held for 21 days (3 weeks) for us. Our current vehicle has done us very well and has allowed us to carry out all the research on Ukuwela conservancy and the surrounding properties as well as animal relocations  land expansions  plastic removal and much more. Sadly  it is at its end and will not last much longer so it is time for a new wild volunteer vehicle to drive the future of our conservation work. What it means to buy this vehicle: • Fuel consumption is almost half. • The maintenance cost is low. • We can get to the local schools for educational days and projects. • We can get to the soup kitchen on a Saturday to feed the foster children. • It means we can go on a snake call out to rescue snakes from people’s houses and help to educate the community. • We can go on animal call outs for injured and orphaned animals. • We can get animals to and from the local vets if needed. • We can release the animals when they are strong enough or wild enough on Ukuwela conservancy. • We can carry out our field research to help protect the animals on Ukuwela and the surrounding properties • We can take equipment to build and maintain pre-release enclosures and make sure that it is safe and suitable for the animals. These points are all important and mean much in the conservation world. With just a small donation you can help us continue all our hard work. We appreciate any and all donations and we will keep you updated on our social media pages with all of our rehabilitation projects and research as we go to show you where your funding is going and how much your donation means to our group of young conservationists. All donors will quaify for a 40% discounbted stay at Umkhumbi Lodge where they will have the opotunity of spending time with the team in the field. www.umkhumbilodge.co.za All donors will also have their name on the vehicle once the branding has been done  corporates welcome….!

Will my wife become paralysed? This year has been the happiest year of our life and the scariest too! After a long struggle my wife and I finally became parents  and we couldn’t have been happier. Until at 36 weeks pregnant my wife’s specialist disclosed his fears  that my wife condition could be life threatening rather than life limiting. He fears that Pip may have one or more components of the triad comprising Chiari Malformation  craniocervical instability and/or tethered cord associated with her chronic health condition. You see my wife has a condition called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome causing faulty collagen that we only believed to be life limiting. Until now Pip has had a full and exciting life  serving in the Royal Navy  studying to be a nurse as well as an extraordinary amount of voltunteer work. She became a qualified leader in scouting and guiding  ran a soup kitchen for 2 years  has sponsored many family’s through Christmas’s and back into employment. When Pip sees a family or a person in need  she can’t help but help  does collections  donates her things and she’s even give the shoes from her feet! She is an amazing  inspirational person as well as a new mum. My son needs his mother  and if she does now have a life threatening condition  I need to know so I can get her treatment. NOW So I’m asking our network of friends to please help us. Unfortunately the scan required for diagnosis is an ‘Upright MRI Scan’ of the cervical lumber spine which will establish if she has any of these conditions. This comes at a steep cost and adding on travel to the Medserena Scanner and to see the UK specialist after the scan we need to raise £2000. The NHS does not own an Upright MRI Scanner and therefore is unable to offer the test required  hence having to pay privately for the scan she has been referred for. Pip wants to enjoy being a mum  but as you can imagine; with this hanging over her head it’s a very emotional time. If you can make a donation or help with a fundraiser  we would appreciate it so much. You can make donations via PayPal. After everything that has been thrown at her over the last 6 years she has fought through to defy all odds. She’s living every second to the max  even starting her little business from home 3 years ago (Pip’s Embroidery UK) when many people would have just given up on employment. She deserves to know  so that she has the chance to try and seek a treatment. Please help my wife  my sons mum. John & Harrison"

The building is situated immediately west of this historic town centre  within the historic town of Bedford; well known for being the home to the likes of preacher and writer of the acclaimed book ‘Pilgrims Progress’  John Bunyan  Edward the Elder’s first known castle fortress and Barony of Bedford.     The building is located on the A6 (Clapham Rd) which is easy to get to regardless of which route into Bedford you are taking. The building is placed between St Martins Church and Livingstone School as well as being a short and enjoyable walks to the beautiful Bedford Park.    Use of the Building    The intention for the building is primarily to be used as a place of worship for ‘all nations’ within the community of Bedford. F.C.C will also play host to a number of community initiatives such as a children’s and Youth activity centre  Meet & Chat Coffee Mornings  Soup Kitchen  OAP’s luncheon activity day  educational activities as well as a Performing Arts initiative. Once complete  the F.C.C building will stand as a beacon in Clapham road Bedford  bringing a fresh look to this area of Bedford.    How far have we come?    St Martins Church  after being unable to keep up with the maintenance of this building  eventually sold it to the council  which planned to turn it into a pre-school in coalition with Livingstone Primary School  which is its neighbouring building to its right. After promised money from government to improve schools were withdrawn  the council had no choice but to put the church hall back on the property market.    Being on the market for two years  we made some inquiries and after much debate about the condition of the property and its value  we managed to decrease the asking price from £250 000 to £70 000. We had managed to raise £82 000 and we were able to buy the property in 2013 cash for £70 000. At the end of 2015 we finally received planning permission for the refurbishment  partial rebuilding and extension of the old St Martin’s Church Hall  to create a significantly new  multipurpose community centre.      The official plans can be seen at the Borough Councils Planning Portal here:     http://edrms.bedford.gov.uk/PlanningBrowse.aspx?id=seZayNzlK66rbT8o9SOTWQ%3d%3d    Since obtaining Planning Permission  we have focussed on...    1.

The design team are working hard to have the “Working Constructions Drawing” (Building Regs Plan) completed by Christmas 2016 to tender in order to Start work within the first quarter of 2017.    Among the core services we offer our community  we also aim to provide a range of high quality and cost effective services to the local community  with the potential to develop new services in response to the changing needs of the community. The many types of skill sets available through FCC affiliation as well as the many needs those skills sets aims to reach on a weekly basis  leaves us with no choice but to build upon what we already have  bringing what we do using four different location  under one roof.    Another part of our project that we are excited about involves working in partnership with Bedford Borough  local doctor surgeries and community services to pilot a volunteering ‘Community Health Champion’ service. Active ‘Health Champion’ models in action combined with the spiritual and emotional support churches offer across the UK have proven to be very successful; our aim is once the project has matured and gained the local communities trust  we will run a 24 hours support service for the emotional and mental needs of beneficiaries at the time their crisis occurs. Crisis can happen at any time  in the same way an individual with a broken leg or a heart attack shouldn't have to wait to see a doctor during office hours  those with emotional and mental crisis should have the same opportunities.     Mental and emotional health should have the same amount of care  thought and urgency  as physical health. As our building sits in one of the lowest deprived areas in the country  we aim to notably promote this unique service in this particular LSOAs (Lower Layer Super Output Area) which is among the 0-20% most deprived areas in Bedford and Kempston town.     Time banking’ (TB)  a way for people from all walks of life to ‘deposit’ their time in the TB by giving practical help and support to others  being able to ‘withdraw’ their time when they need something done themselves. TB promotes social inclusion and empowers individuals by making members feel valued  enabling them to share their skills with others learning new skills themselves.    Partnerships and effective community involvement is vital to ensure our project services and activities are a success. Involving local residents  particularly disadvantaged and vulnerable communities  in helping to design and deliver our projects and services will help build confidence  ownership and a sense of community. We are in the process of consulting with local council and professional organisations  such as TB UK regarding planning  implementation and sustaining our community service as well as contacting other similar projects to share and learn from their experience.     How can you get help?    With your help we can complete the renovations needed to establish the vision of Faith Community Church.

The Sikh Soup Kitchen are a community/ food bank based service  whom you can call on and they will provide you with support and vegetarian cooked meals including any social support adhering strictly to the Government guidelines. I have been inspired by them to become a vegetarian from the lovely cooked meals that they have been providing to me in this pandemic. They also have a dedicated phone line  where you can call during the pandemic for a ‘friend to chat’ service.

Siphokazi lives in a very dangerous  poverty stricken township near Muzienburg  Cape Town. After spending 6 weeks getting to know her whilst volunteering at the day care centre she worked at  within the township where she lives  it was clear to see she struggled immensely; surrounded by violence and crime  earning 1000 rand (approx. £47) a month  she had very little funds to survive and no way of escaping.    Her house is one singular room  made up of metal sheets. She lives there with her two small children. It took her until the day we said our goodbyes for her to build up the courage to show me where she lived. We both cried when she did.    She fears for her and her children's lives  daily. Every day there are murders  robberies and attacks happening on her doorstep. A brutal reality for a lot of South Africans who live in townships.    We have stayed in close contact for the last year  checking in on each other regularly. When the pandemic hit  she told me that she'd lost her job at the day care centre  the only income she had to feed herself and her two young children. Although I have helped her when I can  due to losing my own work because of the pandemic  I cannot help her as much as I wish that I could  nor as much as she really needs me to.    She is currently feeding herself and her two children at a pop up soup kitchen which has been set up in the township. They wait in line for hours to be fed a tiny portion of soup  once a day.    I am reaching out to anyone who can afford to donate any amount  big or small  to help this brave and inspiring woman with an absolute heart of gold. She struggled before the pandemic  she's struggling during and she'll no doubt struggle after.    ANY amount we can raise for her really will make a huge difference to her and her children's lives.    As Go Fund Me takes a 2.9% fee from donations  I'm going to make this amount up personally  meaning the full amount given will be transferred to Sipohkazi via Western Union once the campaign has ended.    Thank you so much  Laurie      (a photo I took of Siphokazi's beautiful  smiley face  a few days before I left Cape Town) "

The country has been in our hearts for many years and we are saddened by the impact the Corona crisis has had on the local townships and villages close to where we live. We are looking to raise funds to ensure Children do not go hungry and can ensure you that every penny raised will go directly to those that need it most.     The South African Government has been very successful in curtailing the spread of the Corona virus by enforcing a severe lockdown. This approach is understandable when you consider that close to 8 million people in SA are living with HIV  and high prevalence of TB. However  without any income  people in the townships are more concerned with the risk of starving than catching the virus!    As some of you may be aware  I am a member of the Helderberg Rotary Club in South Africa  where I have been involved in the local township’s ‘Schools Project’. As a result of the Corona virus we are now focused on providing food and shelter to the thousands of families  particularly young Children in our local townships; Nomzano  Lwandle   Sir Lowrys Village and Macassar.    Below are some of the projects that we have recently initiated and for which we are desperately seeking financial support;    Somerset West Night Shelter – accommodates the homeless in the Somerset West area who at this time are severely affected by the situation. We are providing the Shelter with hot meals  toiletries and warm blankets.    The Ikhaya Soup Kitchen earlier this week. It supplies hot meals to 815 People three times a week.            The MHELP Soup Kitchen in Macassar hands out food parcels to some 250 people three times a week.          Masikule provides food and toiletries to some 1 950 families totalling about 8 400 people in areas around Sir Lowry’s village and Macassar.    Any donation to help these projects would be greatly appreciated. No management costs will be applied by Rotary  as all members are volunteers. This means that every penny (or rand!)  is spent solely on purchasing food and other essentials and the distribution to the families who live in these local townships. Thank you very much  warm regards and please stay healthy.    RONAN & GERRY  30th April 2020      Below are some of the photos taken this week at the Ikhaya after school.               "
