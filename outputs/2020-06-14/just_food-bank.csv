,,,1110522,"The Trussell Trust",False,2019-11-28,"<div></div><div dir=""auto"">This festive season we’re building on the successes of the previous two years and raising money for the Trussell Trust — a brilliant charity that helps thousands of people in the UK feed their families in times of crisis via foodbanks. Last year, the Trussell Trust network gave out over 1.6 million three-day emergency food supplies to people in need, that’s a 19% increase on the previous financial year.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">When we started raising money for the Trussell Trust in 2017, 13 million people were living below the poverty line. Two years on, this number has grown to 14 million. People are going hungry every day for a range of reasons, from benefit delays (due to a drastically underfunded switch to universal basic income) to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. This number is growing for a multitude of reasons but the responsibility lies in the same place each time. Our current government is failing us.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">Winter is always the busiest period for foodbanks, so we’d like your help to raise as much cash as possible. A tin of beans costs as little as 30p, so any donation you make however small or large will really help!</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">We wish that each year we wouldn't need to fundraise for this cause, it shouldn’t be down to the Trussell Trust (and many other similar organisations), there should be a system that supports and cares for people.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">Please share this on all of your social platforms to help us achieve our goal. Then, on December the 12th please vote for a change — the right are failing us all, but most importantly, they're failing those who are in need of a social care system that works.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">Thank you, we couldn’t do this without you!</div><div><br></div><div><div><div><div><font color=""#3a3a3a""></font></div></div></div></div>",73,73,"2020-01-11 10/2019-12-24 15/2019-12-19 7/2019-12-19 10/2019-12-17 30/2019-12-16 10/2019-12-14 25/2019-12-14 20/2019-12-14 20/2019-12-14 20/2019-12-14 10/2019-12-13 20/2019-12-13 20/2019-12-12 10/2019-12-12 50/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 10/2019-12-10 10/2019-12-10 50/2019-12-10 10/2019-12-10 20/2019-12-10 20/2019-12-10 30/2019-12-09 20/2019-12-09 20/2019-12-07 20/2019-12-07 10/2019-12-06 25/2019-12-05 10/2019-12-05 5/2019-12-05 20/2019-12-03 20/2019-12-03 20/2019-12-03 5/2019-12-03 20/2019-12-02 25/2019-12-02 10/2019-12-01 20/2019-12-01 10/2019-11-30 15/2019-11-29 25/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 40/2019-11-29 100/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 50/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 15/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-28 15/2019-11-28 30/2019-11-28 10/2019-11-28 10/2019-11-28 50",https://www.justgiving.com/Foodbank2019,2020-01-11,1507,1500,"Festive Food Bank Fundraiser 2019"

They are working closely with their network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how they can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that they're able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.</p><p></p><p><span>It's times like these that you learn to give again.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>For a bonus - if we hit £200...</p><p>Andy <span>""I would only eat a scotch bonnet if you paid me £2000"" Donnan&nbsp;</span>will eat a whole habanero pepper (with milk)</p><p>Matt ""mushrooms are like slugs and make me gag"" Wright will eat three raw portobello mushrooms<br><br><span>Jack ""OoooO thats spicy"" Cundall will eat a whole brown onion raw</span><br></p>",37,37,"2020-05-19 10/2020-05-18 30/2020-05-17 10/2020-05-16 20/2020-05-15 50/2020-05-15 20/2020-05-15 15/2020-05-15 30/2020-05-15 10/2020-05-14 10/2020-05-14 20/2020-05-14 20/2020-05-14 10/2020-05-14 10/2020-05-14 20/2020-05-14 30/2020-05-14 30/2020-05-14 25/2020-05-14 10/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 20",https://www.justgiving.com/hackney-half-dwc,2020-05-19,620,200,"Half Marathon for Food Banks"

The explicit aim of this policy is to 'incentivize' unemployed people into work [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37873922]. It is ideologically motivated, responding to the myth that being on benefits is a lifestyle choice, and will disproportionately affect single mothers and larger families as a result [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/families-set-to-lose-100-a-week-under-chilling-new-benefit-cap-theresa-may-george-osborne-a7401681.html]. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, savings made from this measure are likely to be offset by emergency hardship payments made to those struggling to pay their rent [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/07/new-cap-on-benefit-payments-will-only-result-in-trivial-savings/].</p><p><span>My day of willingly foregoing food is nothing compared to the food insecurity and poverty that thousands of people are forced to undergo on a regular basis. The benefits cap will erode the physical and mental health of individuals and families, including those who are already suffering, and represents a shocking assault on human dignity. Clearly, food banks are not a whole solution to this issue. However, they can offer two powerful sustenances: food and hope.</span></p><p><span>If you decide not to donate to this page or are not able to at this time, please consider adding a couple of extra items to your weekly shop in future and donating them to your local food bank.

,,,1122173,"East London Business Alliance",False,2020-04-14,"<p>Food banks in east London are struggling in the wake of the Coronavirus outbreak. Donations are down 25% and with people panic-buying in supermarkets, important staples like UHT milk are difficult to come by. Also, low income families are struggling to provide food for children that would normally receive free school meals.</p><p>Food banks are a vital service for people experiencing food poverty caused by unemployment, low wages, benefit delay/changes, debt, or other personal crisis. From the food bank, individuals or families receive a nutritiously balanced food parcel, essential toiletries, and household items.</p><p>It's not right that people are going hungry.

This whole pandemic nonsense will hit those on low to no incomes the hardest and, right now, it’s tricky enough to find some of life’s essentials in the shops when you <i>can</i> afford them.</p><p>So as I sat here at home, unravelling at the prospect of being on lockdown, stuck inside, having to move house and have building work done in the midst of all of this, I realised I was being a bit of a whiny bitch.

More would be amazing though, and super helpful for a really important charity. I dunno, maybe I’ll dream up some stretch goal rewards or something if we break the target. Time and date of The Buzzening to be announced as and when/if the mark is hit. If it isn’t hit, well, we’ll see. And I say buzz rather than shave because I’m not pulling a razor across my bonce.

And it shouldn't be so very hard. All of us at First Base are pretty proud of the emergency food parcels we have been handing out for the last 13 years. We are very much aware that the REALLY hard part of living off emergency food is being in a position where you NEED to live off emergency food. It is a very bleak place indeed to find yourself in. We see this every single day in the eyes of those who come into First Base.</p><p>I am lucky. I don't need emergency food. Not right now at least. So I am not asking for your support for any kind of recognition of me doing something remotely difficult. Instead I am asking for support for something much more profound. Over the coming eight months of winter over 3000 people will come through the doors of First Base. Each and every one of them will be in the miserable position of finding themselves unable to buy food to eat. And we will all do our very best to make sure each and every person who comes to us will leave the building with a bag full of the kind of food I am about to live off for a few days.</p><p>But there is a problem. A pretty big problem. As I write these words we have enough funding in place to just about keep the doors open until the end of December. Then nothing. January nothing. February nothing. March nothing. Three long, cold winter months when hundreds and hundreds of people will need us to be there to provide emergency food.</p><p>Sadly this is a problem we are only too familiar with. Every frontline charity in Britain knows how it is to live on the edge of a funding cliff. It is hard and it is stressful. Our local community is utterly amazing when it comes to donating food. Last year we received over £40,000's worth. When I spend my three days eating emergency food I will be lucky enough to have a fresh loaf of bread donated by Greggs and a pack of ham donated by Brown Brothers. The list of our food donors is a long one and we feel honoured to be supported by so many.</p><p>However the bags of food that arrive every day will never pay our electric bill. Or the phone bill. Or the rent. Or wages. Or the detailed accounts we are legally and rightly obliged to produce for the charity regulator. Or fuel in the tank to deliver made up food parcels to the 20 collection points we bow have across the region.</p><p>These are the boring bills which cover the nuts and bolts of keeping the doors of any front line charity open. They are boring but unavoidable. And the money to cover these boring bills is our life blood. By hook or by crook we need to find £20,000 before the end of March to ensure our doors stay open. It won't be easy. Anything but. However it is a situation we are only too familiar with. We have faced down this kind of funding crisis many times over the last 13 years and we are confident of doing so again. Never once have we turned away a single person who has come to us for emergency food. Not once. We're all pretty proud of that record and we have no intention of allowing such a thing to happen in the coming winter.</p><p>So. How can you help? Well there are two options. Of course you can donate a few quid on this page and if you do so we will be hugely appreciative. Or maybe you might want to go a stage further and do exactly what I am doing - live off a First Base emergency food parcel for half a week and raise so cash either with a page like this one or by using more traditional sponsorship forms. So how would that work? Easy. You can call me on either 07770 443483 or 01387 279680 or you can e mail me at markglenmill@aol.com. I will then deliver you a three day food parcel and sponsorship forms should you need any. Tell you what. I'll throw in a full signed set of my back list of books as a thank you. Then it is a case of eating emergency food for three days and chasing in a few donations.&nbsp;</p><p>So that's that I guess. Please support us either by donating to this page or by starting up a page of your own. Maybe I will see you soon with a box of food and a bag of books!</p><p>All the best</p><p>Mark</p>",127,2,"2020-03-31 20/2018-05-23 60",https://www.justgiving.com/MarkSimonFrankland,2020-03-31,12556,15000,"I'm raising cash to make sure the First Base food bank survives the winter"
,,,1140963,"FAST UK",False,2017-10-06,"<p>For the past three years FAST UK has helped to finance an emergency food bank for some of the poorest people and families living in the Rroma village called Apalina on the outskirts of Reghin. So far the charity has helped to feed over 200 families but we would love to help more!</p><p>After a past visit we were asked for some help by Pastor Attila Toth who informed us that many families within this village were trying to survive on just one or two small meals per week. In the summer months it is possible for families to survive on gleanings from locally grown crops but in winter with temperatures often dropping to as low as -32 degrees centigrade with snow on the floor this makes this way of living almost impossible.</p><p>With the money raised on this page as a charity we will send money to Attila so that he is able to purchase good basic food locally in Reghin. All of the food purchased will be given out to the most needy families according to the need.&nbsp;</p><p>On a recent visit this summer that I was on Attila told one of our trustees that the funds provided over the past few years have enabled people to have enough to eat through the harsh winters and in a few cases even prevent people from starving to death. After seeing the people living within the village in September 2017 and hearing many families stories, I feel very passionate about helping them and would love you to as well!</p><p>Currently the total we send to the food bank is £1500.00 per year but we would love to send more if possible so more people can be helped. The £1500.00 we give feeds approx 200 through the long winters which amounts to about £10 per person to see them through the whole winter period. This money not only enables people to eat but also to have a much easier time throughout the winter months as this is often the hardest time for families living in such a difficult environment and with so little.&nbsp;</p><p>Can you help some on eat well this winter for just £10?</p><p><font color=""#212121"">If you can help then that would be fantastic, remember&nbsp;no matter how much you can donate, every pound helps to feed a person for a day, week, month and winter.</font></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

I recently signed up to volunteer for one of Urban Community Projects' initiatives, the Camden Mobile Food Bank, to deliver food donations to vulnerable families who live on local estates. I signed up for the initiative because of 2 major reasons:<br><br>1) More so than ever, this is a time when&nbsp;the recipients&nbsp;really need our help as many of them, be it the elderly or ill,&nbsp;are confined to their homes and are unable to collect the food parcels themselves. &nbsp;<br><br>2) I myself have been fortunate enough to be a recipient of other people's generosity of time and financial resources, and I know from firsthand experience that a small act of kindness has the power to make a significant difference to another individual's life.&nbsp;To the extent that I&nbsp;am able to, I would like to keep this 'cycle of generosity' alive. <br><br>I am appealing to you because alongside my volunteering to deliver food, I&nbsp;have created a page&nbsp;to help raise funds for <em>Urban Community Projects </em>so that the charity is able to continue carrying out essential services to vulnerable members of our community, at a time when it is most needed. If you are able to, I ask that you please donate through the&nbsp;<em>Just Giving&nbsp; </em>website to&nbsp;support <em>Urban Community Projects</em>. <br><br>I will match your donations by committing to&nbsp;doing as many food delivery trips as I can possibly squeeze in outside of my work hours. &nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance.<br>Sello </p>",54,54,"2020-06-10 50/2020-06-09 50/2020-05-29 50/2020-05-18 50/2020-05-12 100/2020-05-07 30/2020-05-06 30/2020-05-04 50/2020-05-04 15/2020-05-04 50/2020-05-03 30/2020-05-01 100/2020-04-29 100/2020-04-25 50/2020-04-25 30/2020-04-21 20/2020-04-21 200/2020-04-21 30/2020-04-21 100/2020-04-21 100/2020-04-21 25/2020-04-20 20/2020-04-20 50/2020-04-19 30/2020-04-19 20/2020-04-17 50/2020-04-17 100/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 10/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 50/2020-04-16 20/2020-04-16 50/2020-04-15 40/2020-04-15 20/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-15 50/2020-04-15 50/2020-04-15 20/2020-04-15 20",https://www.justgiving.com/Sello-Lekalakala,2020-06-10,5405,5000,"A Helping Hand "

For people on low incomes, a sudden crisis  redundancy, benefit delay, illness or even an unexpected bill  can mean going hungry. Every day parents skip meals to feed their children and people are forced to choose between paying the rent or eating.

Since our launch weve given away over 100 tonnes of food to over 12,500 people in need, including almost 5,000 local children.

We are part of The Trussell Trusts UK-wide foodbank network, and together we provide food to thousands of people nationwide every year. The Foodbank is hosted at the Oasis Centre, St Johns Waterloo and St George the Martyr on behalf of South Bank Churches.

We work with local frontline care professionals, such as schools, charities, housing associations, GPs, health visitors and churches, to identify those in need. They distribute vouchers that the client then exchanges for food. When clients arrive at the Foodbank, we offer them the chance to meet with ",2,2,"2020-05-20 30",https://www.justgiving.com/stephanie-mcivor-oakley2,2020-05-20,50,200,"Waterloo Foodbank"

I think the numbers of people being helped have jumped from around 25 to 110 per week. They have already had some very kind donations but, as you can imagine, the demand is using up the money fast.

The main earner was self-employed and his business had been forced to stop. As you may know, that means the family will not receive support until June. The lady that answered the door ended up in tears as she explained that she never expected to be in this situation. I have to admit it was very moving to hear her story but thank goodness the Foodbank has been able to help.

I would love to raise £1000 pounds for the Food Bank in Worcester to help put a smile on numerous family faces this Christmas.

The dogs were welcome in and I sat alone in the corner waiting for my husband to pick me up when I got talking to a stranger. One hour later it transpires that the guy was an ex- serviceman who due to PTS had found himself living locally in a tent, we got talking and although his life was tough he took nothing from the government but did odd jobs in order to provide for himself. I brought him a pint and later my son and husband turned up, he offered to buy us all a drink which I decided as we were driving, he still came back from the bar with three orange juices. We have so much and he has nothing but yet he still brought us a drink which he could not afford. We all have so much in life and yet others have nothing and yet they are willing to share what they have! My son learnt so much tonight, on the way home he asked if we could give all his old toys to other people for Christmas that didn't have things for Christmas! Tomorrow I am off to do a weeks shop and leave it with the landlord to give to that man as last night was a truly moving experience not just for me but for my entire family!

Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.</p><p>Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure. We're working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.</p>",2,2,"2020-05-22 30/2020-05-20 25",https://www.justgiving.com/AnneThomasPhotographyVirtualShoot,2020-05-22,55,300,"Anne's Virtual Photoshoot Opportunity"

,,,1110522,"The Trussell Trust",True,2020-05-24,"More and more people are being forced to use food banks because they cannot afford the basics in life. Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

It's a huge milestone for us, especially given the current global pandemic and the impact it's having on small businesses like ours around the world. &nbsp;Because community is one of the most important things to us as a business, and a team, w<span>e want to celebrate by giving back. Over the next 12 months, we will be undertaking 40 good deeds, big and small, to support our local community, other businesses and charities close to our hearts.&nbsp;</span></p><p>We're kicking off by walking, running, cycling and dancing 400 miles in 40 days to raise money for The Trussell Trust. This is not your usual sponsored walk/cycle/run because several members of the team are self isolating - we're going to be getting creative and completing our miles in all sorts of ways, including exercise bikes, step machines!&nbsp;</p><p>We've chosen to support The Trussell Trust for this because we want to support the vital service that they offer. More and more people are being forced to use food banks because they cannot afford the basics in life. Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year. Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure. The Trussell Trust are working closely with their network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how each food bank can be best supported in the coming months to make sure that they're able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.</p><p>Anything you can give to help this worthy cause will make a difference.

It's heartbreaking to think that in the 21st century, there were families this Christmas that had no food and no presents for their children. Women have to rely on food banks for sanitary items, due to their vast expense. Issues with universal credit have left many families without any money over the Christmas period. The fallout from poverty is enormous; mental health issues, access to health services, travel, employment, access to healthy food, happy and well cared for children.&nbsp;</p><p>Without foodbanks, many people in poverty would have NO access to food at all. They provide a safe space. Somewhere warm and dry. They can also offer support and advice to those in need, who may be isolated or unsure of their options.

,,,1110522,"The Trussell Trust",True,2020-05-22,"More and more people are being forced to use food banks because they cannot afford the basics in life. Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

Film yourself hitting all 20 and for everyone you get in the bucket - donate (a minimum) of £2.00 to the just giving page below. <br><br>https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/carlo-cocozza<br><br>The idea is to get a lot of people taking part, so please post your video and nominate another garden golfer! <br><br>If you are tagged in this, you are nominated 😉 good luck!<br><br>Eg get 1 out of 20, donate £2 (or whatever you choose). <br>Get none in, donate at least £2 anyway.

This impacts all sectors of society  from children to the elderly  as well as the vital work in areas such as palliative care, serious diseases, mental health, housing support, food supplies and countless others that charities support.",40,40,"2020-05-04 26/2020-04-27 30/2020-04-27 20/2020-04-27 50/2020-04-27 26/2020-04-26 50/2020-04-26 20/2020-04-26 30/2020-04-26 30/2020-04-26 30/2020-04-26 74/2020-04-26 10/2020-04-26 10/2020-04-26 28/2020-04-26 25/2020-04-26 10/2020-04-26 30/2020-04-26 25/2020-04-26 20/2020-04-26 25/2020-04-26 20/2020-04-26 20/2020-04-26 20/2020-04-25 20/2020-04-25 30/2020-04-24 50/2020-04-24 20/2020-04-24 50/2020-04-24 30/2020-04-24 20/2020-04-23 20/2020-04-23 20/2020-04-23 20/2020-04-23 10/2020-04-22 20/2020-04-22 30/2020-04-22 20/2020-04-21 10",https://www.justgiving.com/CavendishroadSK4,2020-05-04,1034,260,"Cavendish Road 2.6 challenge"

,,,1110522,"The Trussell Trust",False,2020-03-24,"More and more people are being forced to use food banks because they cannot afford the basics in life. Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

And to track our fundraising we came up with a further idea to keep a count of the donations made through Lambeth Books' JustGiving page for Baranrdo's&nbsp;with a Lambeth Books' bookometer.<span>&nbsp;Every three months we will calculate the amount of books donated by dividing the amount raised in that quarter by the average price of a book in the UK to calculate how many 'virtual' books we have managed to collect on behalf of Barnardo's.

As we are all working from home at present one of the things that helps us with our mindfulness during these difficult times is getting closer to nature. So, we and some of the other classes in our school, have been growing sunflowers which has been great fun We are going to see who can grow the tallest!&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>Now some of us have grown more than one, including our teacher, Mr Worthington, and we wondered what to do with them all. Mr W thought it would be a good idea to have little plant sales in our own communities to raise a few pounds for our local food bank, the Stamford and Oundle Food Bank. They are part of the Trussell Trust, who's aim is to end hunger and poverty in the UK.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The Trussell Trust support a nationwide network of food banks which together provide emergency food and support to people locked in poverty, and campaign for change to end the need for food banks in the UK.</span></span></p><p><span><span>In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. They support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year.</span></span></p><p><span><span>It takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why they bring together the experiences of food banks in the network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK.</span></span></p><p><span><span>So, if you would like to join in the fun and grow some plants to sell for a few pennies each then please do so, donating any monies raised to this fund-raising page. If you would just like to make a small donation then any contributions will be gratefully received as we aim to raise £250 for this very worthwhile charity.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Happy growing!</span></span></p><p></p>",4,4,"2020-06-09 12/2020-06-04 25/2020-05-30 17",https://www.justgiving.com/Class4Wfoodbankappeal,2020-06-09,56,250,"4W are Growing Plants for Food!"

Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops,&nbsp;</span><span>it's</span><span>&nbsp;likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that they're able to continue to help people in crisis in their
