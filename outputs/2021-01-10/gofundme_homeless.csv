" Covid Winter Relief for London's homeless ","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/underonesky-homelessaid2020,227778,230000,,2019-11-09,,,0,,"2020 has been beyond challenging for people affected by homelessness. The sad truth is the worst is yet to come with Covid19 levels spiking and cold winter nights. The winter shelters are closed and few have been offered emergency hotel accommodation. Like in the 1st lockdown Under One Sky is stepping into the void.    We have served our homeless friends more than 43 000 times in 2020. Over the Christmas period we will run 55 outreach events providing meals  clothing  toiletries and sleeping bags more than 4000 times. On Christmas day we are hosting a Christmas lunch with partners DineAtMine & Chameleon  in addition to serving Christmas lunch on the streets of Central London and returning to serve dinner in the same areas.    Under One Sky is a collective of more than 1000 private individuals. Nobody is employed by Under One Sky. Our work is 100% volunteer based. Under One Sky was founded in 2012 and had since then supported 4000 homeless friends until the first lockdown in March. By the end of 2020 that figure will has exploded to 50 000 (lockdown video).    We have poured all our resources into supporting our friends on the streets. This is why we are continuing with this funding campaign set up in Nov 2019 instead of creating a new winter specific one. We have little left of the funds raised to date:    2019 Dec to 2020 Dec: £190 000 spent / 200+ outreach events / 43 500 served / £4.4 cost per serving. Items provided includes food  drink  clothing  sleeping bags  toiletries  £30 gift cards to Argos  mobile phones  train tickets and shelter during 1st lockdown.    We need to keep raising funds to keep going through the winter months. Your support helps us keep our friends going each day during this pandemic and might very well save lives. We go the extra mile for our friends have helped several into accommodation  employment and get reunited with their families.     Our teams are that light in the darkness for all those who remain abandoned on the streets. We will continue to be that daily until the end of winter. We meet people affected by homelessness in a spirit of compassion and have established many personal friendships out there. Our aim is to make everybody feel they belong in this world and to let them know they have not been forgotten.    If you are not able to donate  then we would love for you to share our campaign using the “Share” button (below the “Donate Now” button) or using this link: www.gofundme.com/f/underonesky-homelessaid2020    It is also possible to support by donating sleeping bags using our Amazon Wish list    Finally  you are welcome to send us a message for us to share with the homeless – simply contact us on this page.     “At least we are under the same sky – you and I.” Ranata Suzuki        ",False

I will call her sis   she is very prideful so I really appreciate her allowing me to do this for them.My sis and her family spent their Christmas in a hotel room. They have been there for three weeks but can no longer afford to fund this. They live in a privately rented property that is not fit for purpose. The property is riddled with damp  mold and now a leak in the kitchen. Environmental health placed the property in category 1  this means not fit or safe to live in. The landlord refuses to do anything as sis is behind with her rent.   Health My sis suffers with a degenerative disc disease. This affects her mobility  due to damaged nerves she suffers with chronic pain  she is awaiting spinal surgery. My youngest nephew is on CAMHS waiting list  he struggles with routine and social situations.   Current situation There are many people involved in this case  environmental health  local mp  schools  Gp's. This will all take time but sis needs help now. The schools have now stated kids will be doing online learning. This will be very difficult in a hotel room that they eat and sleep in. Initially the kids found this all very exciting but now missing their rooms and their things. I am concerned the only help that will be offered is temporary accommodation  this could mean uprooting the kids from all they know.   Fundraiser The fundraiser is to help with the deposit for a new property and first month rent. Help to pay off the existing landlord  storage fees and everyday living. The current environment with Covid has made it harder to get things done and I know everyone is struggling. All payments will go directly to my sis and page will be updated to keep you informed. We would appreciate anything you can give no matter how small  this will be a blessing to them. Many thanks in advance.     ",False

Im not quite sure what else to say here except that if you know him you know what this is in aid of and i hope you will help to keep that light from his soul to glow on us all one more night in these dark days. With the funds raised I plan to try and get public space for the statue and also to pay for any costs incurred for Bobs remembrance service  also I want to build a memorial garden. I also have two long term goals which I am now going to pursue in his honour which are to Start a trust or Foundation for those who have no voice  wether human or animal I want to be able to pay forward and help however I can. my other project will be about making a documentary series where each episode I will travel to a different city and sleep rough with the local homeless and explore how different societies view homelessness and how their respective governments try to deal with it in an effort to educate myself and the viewer about the realities of being out there in the world with no roof or hope. Bob has inspired me and I know many of you  so I feel this will be something you can all get behind and help to make real  I want to finally point out that I do not plan to use any of this money for myself except to cover the expenses of the projects and memorial funds  I have no need of it personally but I wanted the public to feel they are a part of Bobs legacy!! We hit £100.000 - This has blown me away  thank you all so much for your support  everything that comes in from now will be put towards the Trust on top of the funds left after we calculate the cost of his memorial and the documentary!! Also if you want to keep up to date with what I am doing then you can follow Bandit & Gizmo (Brothers of Bob) on Instagram & Facebook. I will be having a memorial service in June 2021 for the 1st anniversary of Bobs passing and will keep everyone posted for the details so you can all attend if you can!! Thank you James Bowen",False
" Let's end rough sleeping in London ","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/endroughsleeping,91138,-1,,2019-12-10,,,0,,"Donate today - help make sure no-one needs to sleep rough in London again.    We’ve all seen people sleeping rough near where we live and work. Rough sleeping has more than doubled in London since 2010. During the past year alone  almost 9 000 people were seen sleeping out on London’s streets.    Welfare changes  soaring housing costs  and a shortage of affordable accommodation mean that more and more people are left with nowhere they can call home. The London Homeless Collective (29 charities with decades of experience in tackling homelessness) are working with the Mayor of London and local councils to provide services to help people rough sleeping to leave the streets.     Every Londoner can help too. You can donate to the London Homeless Collective so that we can offer more support to help people leave the streets and rebuild their lives.    Each member of this group has a specific project – such as providing emergency accommodation  longer-term support  or providing advice and assistance - that will benefit from your support. By giving your money to this coalition of charities  you can be confident that your donation will be distributed fairly and provide real help for people sleeping rough.     The Mayor of London  Sadiq Khan said: “The number of people sleeping rough on our streets is a national disgrace  and since becoming Mayor I have made it a priority to do everything in my power to tackle this crisis.    “The generosity of Londoners is well known  especially at this time of year  so I implore everyone to give what they can to help some of the most vulnerable people in our society.    “Every year we help record numbers through my winter programme - and while this is a testament to the hard work of outreach workers and shelter staff  it is also a damning indictment of the Government’s failure to get to grips with this vitally important issue.”     If you would like to find out more about the projects that will be funded email [email redacted].uk    The London Homeless Collective comprises:    The 999 Club and Lady Florence Trust  The Albert Kennedy Trust  Barons Court Project  Caritas - Anchor House  Centrepoint Soho  The Church Army  The Connection at St Martins-in the-Fields  Crisis UK  Depaul UK  Evolve Housing + Support  Glass Door Homeless Charity  Homeless Action in Barnet  Homeless Link  Housing Justice  Kingston Churches Action on Homelessness  LookAhead  New Horizon Youth Centre  Providence Row  The Salvation Army  Shelter  the National Campaign for Homeless People Limited  The Single Homeless Project  Spear Housing Association Limited  St Mungo Community Housing Association  Thames Reach Charity  The Big Issue Foundation  Passage 2000  West London Mission Methodist Circuit  National Council of Young Men's Christian Associations  Veteran's Aid.

A bit about the process:    We are fortunate to have the support of GoFundMe who donated £5 000 towards the winter campaign and who have been incredibly supportive throughout the planning and launch stages. GoFundMe do not charge any platform fees. A processing fee of 1.9% and 20p applies to all donations. If you choose to claim Gift Aid on your donation  100% of this will be delivered to the charities.

As if that wasn’t bad enough  he is now in danger of having his boat confiscated by the canal and river trust  over the non-payment of licence fees.     Let’s not dwell on why these fees weren’t paid  but the fact that this young man  who has recently lost an eye and his job as a result  is about to loose his home too. I can’t even begin to imagine what he is going through right now  but he definitely does not deserve to be homeless too. Join us in helping to raise the funds to prevent this from happening  and to help Kane keep his home. In these difficult times we’re all facing  we need to be there for each other and to help out as much as we possibly can.    Any money raised through this will go towards paying the license fees  and any additional funds will go towards potentially obtaining a permanent mooring  to make this difficult time slightly easier for him as he is struggling to adjust to sailing his boat with only one eye.

Pete has been street homeless for many years and his last stretch of this dreadful predicament has left him dangerously unwell. Pete has H.I.V hepatitis C  Pneumonia  Renal problems and weeping abscesses among other things. Austerity measures carried out by callous ideology and cruel indifference mean that Pete is not receiving anywhere near the care he needs. I have spoken to a friend who is the manager of a residential service that can give Pete the care he desperately needs and he has agreed that if I can raise £2000  the organisation will cover the rest.  We have all seen the horrendous rise in homeless people on the streets of our cities and no doubt wondered what can be done. Please give generously to this cause today so that not only can Pete receive the care he needs but so that we as a people can send a message to the lawmakers that if they don't act  we will!

Recently  whilst travelling and also performing throughout the cities and towns of Spain   our very close friend ended up doing himself quite the mischief  and unfortunately shattered both of his ankles through a freak accident whilst on his journey  rendering him unable to walk for the next three months.    Due to the current political climate (BREXIT)  he is unable to stay in Spanish hospitals to fully recover and has until Monday to work out where he will : stay  financially support himself and a place to receive medical treatment.

The money donated will go to getting Gareth a wheelchair and making sure he can get home in the fastest and safest way possible.

We have a very heavy focus on health and nutrition as some of the boroughs we work within have the highest rate of child obesity in the country.     3 - We run a service called Parcel to Plate  where we collect ingredients from a members home and cook these ingredients into meals for them - despite Gov food parcels having come to an end  we continue to run this service as it is a crucial for those lacking the ability or equipment to cook in the kitchen.     We are a new venture  born on the 17th of March 2020  as an emergency response to the Covid-19 outbreak. Vital Meals was set up by Ayesha Pakravan-Ovey  who in 2019 launched The Plattery- a small scale catering business. As all of The Plattery’s business was cancelled due to Covid-19  Ayesha launched Vital Meals. We started our journey cooking just 10 meals a day from our Ayesha’s home in Battersea  and have quickly grown to providing over 1 000 meals a week - fast approaching 15 000 meals in total. Initially funded through Ayesha’s own pocket & profits from The Plattery  we were able to raise £26 000 on this Go Fund Me platform which enabled us to provide 12 000 meals. We now need your help again to raise further funds to allow us to continue to run Vital Meals!     Our newly launched cookery school has quickly become a key part of the Vital Meals offering & we need to continue to fundraise to ensure that children across out community can have access to food education without any financial worry. The feedback from the children has been truly amazing with one 14 year old boy telling us that he wishes to become a chef in the future and that this is the first time he has managed to cook properly to test out his dream. Many of the younger kids have asked us if they can cook with us everyday and they are just so willing to learn & try new things  including vegetables! Naturally  we have a very heavy focus on health & teaching the children balance in their meals and how to use alternatives to sugar/frying/white carbs etc.     Through our work with Vital Meas  we became acutely aware of the fact that people were hungry and struggling with food access pre-Covid. Many have come to rely on our food as their main (and at times) only source of food. With the gov food parcels now having coming to an end  and the ongoing uncertainty around Covid  many in our community are still suffering financially  medically or emotionally. Figures recently released (11/08/20) note that over 750 000 people have lost their jobs due to Covid and many of these people will struggle to put food on the table for their families. We want to help. We have fed a young man who had not eaten a hot meal in 2 weeks  a lady just out of hospital from a major surgery  unable to cook for herself  a man who had eaten nothing in 4 days and have had community members tell us how they have had to face impossible choices like choosing between putting food on the table or having electricity for the night. It is these stories and many more  that are at the core of Vital Meals and continue to drive it forward for the benefit of our community.     We provide 4 meals per person  per household so that everyone at home can have 4 good  nutritional meals a week. Our meals are made by chefs & are always healthy & balanced.     The money raised will go towards:   1 000 Meals a week   Cookery classes for 1 000 children  Salaries for the Vital Meals team  Containers & bags   Congestion charge   Delivery costs   Apprenticeships",False

It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Robin Hood Fund has launched to support our city and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.    The Robin Hood Fund     Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.    In Nottingham we have a famous history of looking after one another. You could call it the spirit of Robin Hood - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.     So we are creating something called the Robin Hood Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.     Our city has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Robin Hood Fund has been set up for us to shine a light on these vital projects and help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.     Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that if possible you donate and contribute to the common good of Nottingham. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.    The spirit of Robin Hood has created something unique in our city  now is the time to reignite that spirit so please donate today if you can and if you can’t please help us spread the word.      * * *    FAQs    What can I do?    Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the vulnerable.     Where have funds been used?    Since the Robin Hood Fund started we have always had one goal  to raise as much money as possible to help those most in need.     To date; the following causes have been supported;     Since the Robin Hood Fund launched we have had one clear goal  to raise much needed funds to support the most vulnerable people in Nottingham during the Covid-19 crisis. Following an amazing response from the people and organisations of our city we have already exceeded all expectations in raising more than £75 000 which has been distributed - or is in the process of being distributed - to a number of charities and organisations undertaking such important work during these difficult times.      To date; the following causes have been supported:      Foodbanks (£20 000)    The Robin Hood Fund has distributed £20 000 in support of food banks across Nottingham. Working closely with Hope Nottingham and Nottingham Forest in the Community to deliver the wider support  food and supplies have been centrally purchased and then distributed to a number of different food banks  including: NG11 Clifton Foodbank  Meadows Foodbank  Grace Church  HOPE Nottingham  Bestwood & Bulwell Foodbank  Himmah / Muslim Hands  Arnold Foodbank and St. Ann’s Advice Centre.      Homeless Organisations (£10 000)    Emmanuel House was awarded £6 000 for additional specialist key worker support to boost its team at a time when Nottingham’s homeless community is at grave risk. This support is helping to ensure the homeless community are being placed into hotel accommodation as an emergency measure as hostels are very vulnerable to outbreaks.       There has also been £4 000 of support released to Framework to enable them to purchase essential items to the Homeless community in Nottingham. This included  but was not limited to  the provision of items such as mobile phones so that they can remain in contact with key workers and minimise the chance of these individuals being unable to stick to the government guidelines on social distancing.       Refugee Groups (£2 500)    Refugee Roots were provided with support to allow them to move from a model that required face to face contact  to being able to still provide support in a safe and socially distanced way.      In addition  Refugee Forum has been provided with funding for a destitution fund to ensure those with no access to support in other places can still get support.       Vulnerable Women (£4 500)    Nottingham Women's Centre have been awarded funding to help them to provide mental health support and online counselling  including training for counsellors to be able to provide online support.      In addition to this  further support was provided to POW Nottingham  an organisation supporting the rights of sex workers and those at risk of being exploited. This funding enabled them to purchase essential items including food and toiletries.      Disability Groups (£2 500)      With social distancing measures causing increased issues for the disability community in Nottingham  this support has enabled the Disability Support Nottingham organisation to increase its capability to provide phone support - in addition to welfare checks - to those in need.      Vulnerable Young People (£2 500)     Funding has also been provided to help support the amazing work of Nottingham YMCA  who are working with the most vulnerable young people in our city during this crisis. The support has helped to provide food and toiletries to those housed in supported YMCA and transitional accommodation.      Where will the funds go?    The most vulnerable people during this crisis and will be administered by the city council and delivered by people and organisations across the city that can help the most vulnerable.    Every Monday Nottingham City Council will administer the release of funds from GoFundMe to Nottingham City Council bank account. This means Nottingham City Council should  on average  have the money in the bank no later than Friday of every week.    Once in Nottingham City Council account the funds are ring fenced and held until the decision re: allocation has been made.    A working group  chaired by Lee Walker  will be set up to recommend how that branch of funds is released. This group is tasked with making the biggest impact possible whilst also being certain that the organisations in receipt a) need and b) promise to spend quickly ie. nobody saves the money. On Tuesday of each week the working group will have a paper approved by a member of ‘gold’ and paperwork will be sent to a small governance committee who are tasked with ethics and assuring the highest standards of governance and distribution.    Remotely the governance group will scrutinise and approve. Once approved Nottingham City Council agrees to distribute as agreed.    Money will then go out asap so groups and organisations are in receipt within 5 days. A one page press note to support and communication online to be transparent.

" Save Downe Campsite ","Orpington, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/zjphf2-save-downe-campsite,575,-1,,2020-11-06,,,0,,"We are challenging you to save Downe  if just each of the 114 000 scouts raised £20 we would be able to cover Downe and put £280 000 into its coffers to upgrade facilities once we can again meet! The below message was posted by Ruth Jewell wife of Steve the former warden of Downe on FB  and is all about why we are raising this money;    For Sale. Downe Scout Activity Centre. £2 million.    Just sixteen miles from the centre of London lies a landlocked oasis.  In 1907 Lord Baden-Powell held the first Scout camp on Brownsea Island and Scouting was born.  What quickly became apparent was that despite the manual BP wrote there was a fast growing need to train the Leaders.  He set the task of finding some land to accommodate this to a man he trusted  who was heavily invested in Scouting and the good that it was already doing.  Finally  in February 1929  66 acres of land were signed over to the Scout Association (or actually the Boy Scouts of London)  who had purchased the land.  The land was initially owned by Lord Lubbock  and the cottage was lived in by his gamekeeper. Charles Darwin lived along the road at Down House  and undertook his famous worm experiments on at least two areas of the site. He also rode regularly through the valley  and the family picnicked there too. It is also recorded that he spoke to the gamekeeper about the flora and fauna that grew in the woodlands.  In a short time adult leader training courses were in full swing (hence the training ground)  and BP would call in when he was passing to have his photo taken with those on the courses.  BP encouraged Scouts from the East End of London to camp at Downe. He felt that it was imperative that the boys had the chance to experience life in the countryside  and all that it could give them.  With this in mind he decided that the boys should also have the opportunity to learn to swim. He approached Ralph Reader  a Rover Scout  and asked him to write a Scout based variety show  which he did. It ran at the Scala theatre in London in Oct 1932  and raised enough funds to build the pool at Downe. Subsequent Gang Shows raised funds for other camp sites as they were purchased around the country. Gang Shows have been performed around the world ever since  often producing some of our best known household named performers.  Additional land was purchased  Birdhouse Wood  making Downe the largest campsite owned by the association  until Gilwell eventually expanded.  The site was supported by a committee of the great and good  one of whom was Sir Jeremiah Coleman. He and his wife donated the money to build the providor (reception building) as their golden wedding gift. They also donated the clock from their stable block  following a fire  and paid for the tower to house it.  The site was actively supported by a huge number of volunteers  which has continued throughout its almost 92 years.  Apart from being mothballed during the war (when it was used by the home guard as a training centre) the site has welcomed Scouts  Guides  Schools and Youth Groups to activity days  camps and indoor breaks.  The Bishop of Rochester was a huge supported of the site  and would spend his summer break camping in the woods. He arranged for the chapel to be built  and provided the cassock  linen  hymn books and silver ware for communion.  When the ship Discovery was brought into the Thames it was given to Sea Scouts to use as a training ship. Items not needed in the ship were given to the HQ owned camp sites and Downe was given a desk (believed to be Shackleton’s) among other items.  BP donated many items to Downe  among which it is believed are the set of Kudu horns.  For a period of time Downe was run by the local Scout County  South East London.  In 2001 Steve was appointed as Manager. He took over a Centre that had had little investment and had barely any money left in the coffers.  With the help and support of well over 120 volunteers he turned the Centre around  and made it a thriving activity centre.  The Centre returned to the umbrella of the Scout Association and continued to grow and develop.  In 2014  following a restructuring  Steve was appointed as Manager of three National Centres and moved to live at Youlbury.  Just eighteen months later another restructure saw Steve  and other key staff  being made redundant (and homeless).  For fifteen years Downe was such an important part of our lives. The friends we made there became family. We welcomed our summer staff from around the globe. They spent seven months with us  learnt new skills  and grew into amazing young people. All of them have gone on to carve amazing careers for themselves.  We welcomed people from around the world every year  just to visit  or to fully immerse themselves in our special  ten day  Campdowne’s.  The relief of driving down Birdhouse Lane was something that I could never explain. It felt like I had literally come home. My shoulders would lift and I would feel safe.  The history and new memories being made were all a part and parcel of life there. We would frequently have people turning up to whom Downe had special meaning.  It is hard to describe what being a part of Downe meant. It got under your skin  it was part of you.  It was hard work  it was relentless. We were on duty 24/7  every day of the year.  I started off helping out  and finally was employed full time as Guest Services Co-ordinator.  It was also the most amazing place ever.  My heart is broken that the Association has failed to invest in it  and keep enough reserves to keep it going. The Second World War didn’t close it  and despite bomb damage it reopened with the support of the volunteers.  So many youngsters came to us from London  having never slept in complete darkness  on the ground floor of a building  and never having seen a squirrel  rabbit  deer  fox or badger in real life. Some had never experienced walking in a muddy puddle  and a group of private school lads rolled in stinging nettles....they had never come across them before as they had gardeners at home.  We have so many incredible memories  I am just so gutted that others will now not have the chance to make amazing Downe memories to carry them through life.     Does anyone have a couple of million spare? Thanks    Should fundraising not meet the target or indeed the purchase of Downe is not possible after meeting the target  funds will be donated to The Scout Association which is a registered charity..

As many of you will be aware  after experiencing homelessness myself on a few occasions  I have worked in the sector for over ten years now.     In a variety of posts  and with a few different organisations  I have witnessed first hand how difficult it is to offer the best support to the people we work with  with a limited amount of funds.     Traditionally  the social care sector is always the hardest hit when it comes to cuts by local authorities or local government  and very often the people who need our support the most  suffer more through no fault of their own.     On September 28th 2020  I plan to walk the West Highland Way - all 96 miles of it - to raise some much needed funds for some of the most vulnerable people in the country. I plan to dedicate the funds to two main charities in Scotland  two charities who are very close to my heart from a personal and professional perspective...

Walking the streets of Oxford during the holidays and speaking with individuals experiencing homelessness  we are reminded of what we take for granted  and what we are capable of giving.     How can an individual experiencing homelessness move forward when they need a clean mask to enter a building; when they need WiFi or a map to find organizations for shelter/food/employment; when they need spare change change for the bus? To lose a home is to lose a cascade of basic needs that allow for independence  well-being  and growth.     Our goal is to organize 15 care packages for individuals experiencing homelessness in Oxford. Each care package will cost roughly 35 pounds. We did our research to determine what will truly benefit them. We want to provide them with:   1) warmth: thermal socks  gloves  and fleece shirts;  2) nutrient dense and energy-providing food: protein/carbohydrate/vitamin-rich bars  oats  crackers  vitamin C supplements  and a thermal water bottle;  3) hygienic supplies: antiseptic cream  unscented baby wipes  pads and tampons  plasters  and Vaseline;  4) information: a printed graphic that visualizes the location and information for services (for food  shelter  employment and counseling) will be provided alongside a hand-written note.    At a time when our hearts have inevitably softened by the difficulties of Covid-19  let us remember those who are living hour-by-hour  and the simple things they deserve that we can do for and give to them.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made the situation even worse and we need your help now. Help us save thousands of animals' lives by helping us build an animal sanctuary which will prevent the build of a kill shelter by the local government.      Our Story    My partner  Charlotte and I spent 1 month in the Philippines in 2019. During our time there  we noticed that plenty of dogs and other animals were badly mistreated  disease ridden  abandoned or homeless. Having wondered if anyone was helping these animals out  we met Rob and Jacq Martin while dining at their restaurant and found that we had met the saviours of these animals. Here is a little more about their work and their mission.    Rob and Jacq have spent the last 5 years in Port Barton on the island of Palawan in the Philippines. Port Barton is a small town that was rapidly gaining traction as an upcoming tourist destination on the island. With a strong background in hospitality they both created their restaurant 'Mojito's' which funded 80% of their projects with animals in the area. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced them to close their restaurant and essentially put an end to any funding for the animals there.    This puppy was found abandoned in a bush.    Prior to the pandemic  their work with animals has seen them treat over 1200 animals for mange and 550+ sterilised. ""We are facing a terrible situation here. We have lost our ability to look after the animals with the shutdown of our restaurant. Tourism was very helpful as the street animals were able to get more food from tourists which we encouraged. Many travellers told us in all of their journeys through the Philippines that the animals were in much better health here than other places. COVID-19 has destroyed this is in one full swoop. Animals are sick and starving and we are working on an immediate relief program once we get out of lockdown in the next 5 days."" - Rob Martin.          Our Plan    It is obvious that Rob and Jacq need to move towards creating a more stable environment and are committed to building an animal shelter with vet facilities  industrial kitchen and lodgings for volunteers.     They were able to get the local government to halt their plan of setting up a kill shelter at the end of last year but they have been informed that talks will resume for that project if another option isn't presented.        Rob and Jacq have been working closely with Palawan Animal Welfare Foundation Inc and will look at going under their NGO flag as an independent sanctuary.    The total cost of securing land and building this facility in Port Barton is estimated at around $120 000USD/£100 000GBP. This will also include rescue vehicles and a mobile vet facility as the nearest facilities are over 2 hours away.    To help kickstart this project we need to work in phases.     - Phase 1 of the project will look to secure immediate aid for the animals  1 acre of land  building plans  engineering permits  local government permits  NGO status as well as water and electricity.    - Phase 2 will look at building an emergency shelter  kitchen  rescue vehicle and basic staff housing.    - Phase 3 will provide vet facilities and a treatment facility.    We need to raise $14 000USD/£12 000GBP to get Phase 1 off the ground. Please share and help save lives.",False

The emergency services were informed and admitted Hareem into Queen's Medical Centre. The doctor that reviewed Hareem's medical records had made the assumption that Hareem had acid reflux  as the doctors suggested his health to be perfect for his age - if not better.    Whilst Hareem was admitted he underwent an Endoscopy scan which uncovered a large sized lump in his oesophagus. The doctors had informed Hareem's family this could be cancerous. He was subjected to a CT scan which confirmed the family's worst fear  Hareem had been diagnosed with oesophageal cancer  which has now spread to his gland. This came as a shock to even the doctors as they stated they've never experienced this in their lifetimes and is extremely rare to be diagnosed with oesophagus cancer at the age of 24.     He currently is 24 years of age  this form of cancer is extremely rare in a young adults as ""less than 15% of cases are found by people younger than age 55."" We  Hareem's brothers  are starting this GoFundMe page on his behalf to help fund for his treatment abroad at John Hopkins hospital in America. The specific treatment that we are seeking at John Hopkins hospital is Immunotherapy  which would be the most effective treatment for the cancer that he has.    Hareem had been diagnosed 6 days before his first wedding anniversary. Hareem Ahmed married on 26th of August 2016 and had dreams of having children. However  being diagnosed with cancer 6 days before your 1st wedding anniversary is heart-breaking. As you can imagine  a year prior to the diagnosis – on his wedding day  he was flooded with happiness which was amplified through his heart-warming smiley  even though he has always had that smile on his face. Despite the devistating news he was confronted with  he still smiles and laughs all the time. He's still the same Hareem everyone knows him as; happy  cheerful and kind-hearted.    Because of this  Hareem has now been forced to put his life on hold. During these 24 years of his life  he has been working towards helping others  having a family and owning his very own business. Hareem has dreams and ambitions to pursue a career within the Business Management and Marketing sector  as this was the subject he studied whilst at University. Furthermore  Hareem firmly believes owning a business isn't enough as helping others is his ultimate goal.    As Hareem firmly believes the family  friends and the general public will assist him in this time of need  Hareem wishes to help others through charity work once he is succesful in his battle with cancer. After being diagnosed with cancer  Hareem has stated he wishes to help those that most need it ranging from those with cancer to those that are homeless. Furthermore  he has also stated that once he recovers from this battle against cancer  he wishes to devot his life towards charity work by starting his own charity foundation and volunteering spare time in order to help those that most need it  as well as owning a business to get him by.    Hareem is a very confident and well spoken individual who aspires to achieve the best he possibly can. He has a strong state of mind and has remained strong throughout this difficult time. He is very thankful for all the support he has been receiving and also reads every comment and message. As he is currently recovering  he's unable to respond to everyone but he does want everyone to know he is very thankful and appreciative of all the support.

It was pouring down with rain & bitterly cold & we couldn't just drive away without offering him something to eat.   We offered him some food that we had on us to which he was extremely grateful for.   We talked for a couple minutes & we then left. We were no more than 5 minutes down the road before we had to turn around & go back to him as something told us we had to help.  We sat in the rain & just talked. Learning Cornish's story only added to the heartbreak. A stone mason by trade of 22 years  never not worked a day in his life  a partner & 2 daughters. Until redundency hit & a messy divorce left him with nothing.   He moved back to his home town Plymouth after several years living up the line to be told by the council that as he had moved away he had lost his local connections & therefore had no housing priority.   What has made Cornish stand out from all the other people ive met living on the streets is his unbelievable courteous manner & gratitude for any help he receives. To make matters worse due to him NOT having either a drug or drink problem & being lucky enough to NOT have any mental health problems it means he is even more less of a priority for help.   I firmly believe we meet certain people in our lives for a reason & that night my Mum & I were meant to meet Cornish as he's given us both such a more appreciative look at life & not to take the small thing's for granted.  This incredibly friendly  polite  well mannered gentlman is currently homeless with only a bag of belongings to his name. All he wants is a roof over his head to call his own & a fixed address to be able to apply to get back into work so he can be his own person again & feel like he can integrate back into society.     I have lined up a bedsit for him  to which the landlord has agreed to but we need to raise the finances to secure it for him.   Im desperate to help Cornish start 2019 the way he deserves so any donation you can afford would be so gratefully appreciated by my Mum & I & of course Cornish.     We're looking to raise a total of £750 which would pay for the deposit & rent in advance needed  as well as food shopping to get him through until his job seekers benefit would be activated.     Please help as much as you can as just to get one homeless person off the street before winter really sets in would be an incredible achievement.     Thankyou for reading & all your support.

" The Winstons Amen Breakbeat Gesture ","Thorpe Waterville, East Midlands, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/amenbrother,24000,-1,,2015-02-18,,,0,,"The amen breakbeat  possibly the most famous breakbeat and sample of all time!  Everyone knows it  and everyone knows where it came from  so that story does not need to be told again here.  However  what is little known  is that the The Winstons have never received a single penny for its use in the countless music that contains it.  Richard L Spencer  (Lead vocals and sax player) who wrote the arrangement was totally unaware of its cult status until around 1996. It was during that time that he was recovering from a heart attack when he received a phone call from a record label looking to get hold of the masters.This surprised him  has he had not had any dealings with the music industry since 1971  which was when he left the scene to carry on with his life  education and work. During that time he had not received a single penny of royalties from publishing or airplay. Bare in mind that it sold over 1 million copies on the back of the A side ""Color him father"". That could of been a LOT of money!  While recovering from his operation at home  he decided to research the song more and to try to find out why there was a sudden interest in it.  He quickly realised the scale of what had gone on regarding the sampling of the breakbeat  and never returned the call to the record label.    Unfortunately  by this time the statute of limitations had run out  and he was unable to legally persue anyone for using the beat in their music. In this era  there were no copyright laws in place regarding sampling like today. Obviously with the amount that it had been used  it would of been logistically impossible to chase after everyone that had used it  and would of cost untold amounts of money in legal bills too.    All he could do was sit back  be frustrated  and accept what had happened. He gave some interviews at the time  and got on with his life.    Gregory Coleman  the drummer who actually played the beat  also never received any royalties from the sample  he sadly died a broke and homeless man around 2006.    Fast forward to 2011  and the BBC/1Xtra radio station ran a feature on the cult amen breakbeat.  As part of that  DJ and presenter Kutski tracked down Richard L Spencer and recorded a short interview with him. This can be heard on the BBC 1Xtra website here:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hb618During that interview  Richard reveals his frustrations regarding people sampling his music  and that they got nothing back for it.    He went on to say  he would love for people to ""do the right thing"" and give a little something back for using the beat  and to make it legal.    This is where I came into the story (myself a long term lover of the amen break. I grew up on electro  hiphop  rap  UK breakbeat hardcore  jungle and drum & bass scenes) after hearing the interview that someone had posted in a Facebook jungle music group.  It got me thinking  that no one had actually taken up the challange of trying to fulfill his wishes  so I immediately tasked myself with getting in contact with Richard  which I managed quite quickly. I explained my plan to try to get a donation page up and running  and got his blessings to do so.  All monies raised will be given to him  as the copyright owner of Amen brother.    So here is where all of you come in  if you have ever written or sold any music with the amen break  or even just enjoyed one of the countless hundreds and hundreds of tunes that contain it over various genres and styles of music  please donate towards the good cause of the worldwide music community giving something back to the man behind the legendary breakbeat.    Please be aware  this is in no way a means to try to chase royalties  fees or to pay for sample clearance.  It is nothing more than a gesture of good will and obviously totally voluntary.    Thankyou from myself  and also on behalf of Richard.Update:As the campaign has now become very public  the terms from gofundme say that I have to add some more information to help protect against funding campaigns that are set up as scams  so here is the info required:1. Who you are  I am Martyn Webster  42  A DJ from UK who grew up on music. I started in the mid 80's with electro  hiphop  and rap  this moved on to electronic genres and ultimately the UK breakbeat hardcore scene. At this point in early 1992 I started mixing and buying vinyl.  I played out at many clubs and venues around the area I live  and followed the scene through the famous jungle era and onto drum & bass.   Of course  all of these genres right from the rap tunes of 1986 started to sample and use the amen break. Thus  I became one of the generation who took it under their wing and loved it in all of its mutations.  I hung up my headphones in 2004 and had a break (excuse the pun!) from the DJ scene. Seven years later the yearning to mix again was too much  so I got another pair of Technics and now mix for personal enjoyment at home.  Over the years I have built up a large network of friends and contacts both off and online  along with my youtube channel (www.youtube.com/user/martynwebster) which has a huge following. I set up the channel as a way to share the passion and knowledge of the music scenes I have loved so much. The channel has nearly 4 million views and just under 7 thousand subscribers.2. Where you're from  I am from the UK and have lived here all my life  in and around the Northamptonshire area.    3. Your relationship to the parties you're raising funds for  I am simply a fan and long term lover of the sample that was generated from Richard and The Winstons music (Color me father is also a wonderful tune in its own right  and as a step father myself  I can associate with it)    4. How the funds will be spent (be specific as possible)  As above  all money raised will go to Richard.  Some people have said some should go to the daughter and step-daughter of Gregory Coleman (the drummer).  If we are able to get in contact with them then it is definitely something that could also happen.5. How you intend to get the funds to those in need  Ultimately  the perfect end to this whole campaign would be to have the opportunity to hand deliver a cheque to Richard  and something I would take great pride in doing. With me being in the UK and him in the USA it makes things slightly harder  but not impossible.  If I can scrape together the money for flights it will happen.  Otherwise  I will have to transfer funds via banking.",False

I’m a British woman whose beloved son was taken away in Dubai.     In 2012 my French Catholic husband used Dubai’s sharia court system to divorce me. The court took my beautiful boy Louis away and I've spent the last 8 years fighting legal battles in 3 countries to be reunited with him.    The sharia divorce stated that I had ‘refused to obey my husband’ and I was a negligent mother because Louis had eczema.     I took my case to the British courts looking for justice  but a High Court judge accepted the sharia divorce granted by a ‘friendly nation.’    In France  the Supreme Court ruled exactly the opposite and threw out the ‘manifestly discriminatory’ Dubai decision. The UN has also condemned the way Dubai courts treat women.     But  in a highly unusual move  the judge in London ordered me to pay my ex-husband’s legal costs. I’m now facing a bill of £93 867.96 and the threat of losing my home.     If you think it’s unacceptable in modern Britain that I should be made bankrupt - because I fought to have a relationship with my young son  and because I fought against Dubai’s sharia system - please give any help you can.     I have only a couple of months to raise the money I need.     Thank you.     #HelpAfsana    ++++++++    I’m just a normal person trapped in horrible circumstances. And my faith in British justice has been badly shaken.    I came back to this country with nothing except the hope of a fair hearing.     But the British judge googled Dubai’s sharia legal system and concluded it was similar to our own divorce laws.     I had reported domestic abuse to the Dubai authorities and provided the British court with evidence of abuse and coercive control. But the judge said I didn’t look or behave like a victim.    He took no account of the fact that I lost my son when he was just three years old. The only thing I gained from the British court case was six hours a year to be with Louis  in a tiny room in London under strict supervision.     The judge accepted that I had been thrown out of the marital home in Dubai. My husband cut off all financial support and until my son was taken away we were homeless and living off charitable handouts.    The judge also accepted that I had PTSD as a result of what happened to me in Dubai. Back in London  I had no job or income.    But he still said I had to pay costs.     If I don't pay  I am threatened with bankruptcy and the loss of my family home. After everything I have endured  this is too cruel. But I will never stop fighting for Louis.     Earlier this year the High Court in London ruled against Dubai's billionaire ruler  Sheikh Mohammed  suggesting his former wife Princess Haya could never get a fair hearing in Dubai's sharia system.     If it’s not fair for a princess  how can it possibly be fair for me? And how can British and French courts come to such different conclusions about my case?     Please take a few minutes to read my story. It explains why the costs order is unjust and why I need your help.      It also raises fundamental questions about British justice.    ABOUT ME    I'm Afsana Lachaux  and I'm a Londoner. I'm a mother  a social policy expert and an activist for women’s rights. In 2019 I won the Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize for my work in campaigning for justice and protection of women.    After I lobbied extensively  the Foreign and Commonwealth Office changed its travel advice  to warn British women that they could face sharia court custody proceedings in the United Arab Emirates.     It was something that never occurred to me when I first moved to Dubai.         WHY AM I CROWDFUNDING?    It’s extremely rare  in cases involving children  to end up paying the other side’s costs.    The judge was given evidence of my inability to pay this exorbitant amount. He was told of the hardship it would cause me financially and mentally.     The only asset I had was my home. When the judge made his decision  I was also caring for my elderly mother.     The court accepted the evidence given by a medical expert that I had been traumatised by being separated from my young son  and by my unjust treatment in Dubai.     The judge found that my husband had kicked me out of the house with a one-year-old baby and had refused to support us financially. Yet  despite all this evidence  the judge decided I should pay my ex husband’s legal costs.    I am trying to rebuild my life. After a decade of being unable to work  I am just getting back to normal. I now work for a charity and campaign on equal access to the law.     Please help me fight this unfair decision and protect vulnerable people from the unaffordable price of real justice.      WHAT WILL I DO WITH THIS MONEY?    1. It will help me pay the legal costs.     2. It will help me keep a home for Louis  so he can get to know his family when he is old enough to make his own decisions.      3. The support generated by this crowdfunder will help my campaign to change the law  to prevent cost orders being made against vulnerable people.     It shouldn't be one rule for the rich  and another for the poor.     WHY DOES THIS MATTER?    This is about whether the British legal system is protecting its own citizens.     Why is it supporting sharia law?    It's morally wrong.     The award of costs can also have a crippling effect financially and emotionally  especially on victims of domestic abuse.     The judge didn't have to make me pay this extortionate amount.     His decision has caused my mental health to deteriorate and placed enormous hardship on me.     Please share with friends  family and well wishers. You can also follow me on twitter @afsanalachaux or visit my website afsanalachaux.com to learn more about this crowd-funding campaign.     I would be grateful for any contribution you can make. Thank you.    Afsana     +++++++++    MY STORY IN MORE DETAIL     In April 2011  my marriage had collapsed. I found myself homeless in Dubai  with a young baby to look after. My husband suddenly changed the locks on the home we had shared.     A few months earlier  I had filed a complaint of domestic violence with the Dubai police. But it was dismissed at a time when Human Rights Watch said Dubai was failing to respond adequately to prevent abuse. You can read more about that here.     I was alone with Louis  cut off from family and friends. And without any financial support from my husband.    While I was struggling to survive in a foreign land  my husband used Dubai’s sharia courts to divorce me.     The judgment stated I was an unfit mother because Louis had eczema  I had gay friends and I had refused to ‘obey my husband’. The court was provided pictures of our pre-wedding party to prove that I ‘frequented night clubs.’     You can read this BBC report about my case https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28638553.     Louis was only three years old when he was taken from me. I was grief stricken and stuck in Dubai without any rights. I eventually got on a plane with just a handbag  and Louis’s Pooh Bear  and came back to the safety of my family in the UK. I put my faith in British justice and hoped for a fair hearing in London.     It was not to be. Instead  the High court endorsed the Dubai divorce and supported the Sharia legal system – the judge said he was “satisfied that the divorce …is entirely consistent with our public policy as it is virtually the same as the ground for divorce that is principally used here.”     This was a huge shock to me because British law doesn’t have a ground for divorce based on disobedience to the husband.     It was only the French legal system that stood up for my rights. In the home country of my former husband  the Supreme Court found the Dubai divorce ruling to be “manifestly discriminatory.”     Other British courts have raised serious questions about the nature of justice in Dubai. Just this year  another British judge found the ruler of Dubai (who is also the head of the Dubai court system) guilty of the kidnap and tortureof his own daughters.       His wife and children fled to Britain seeking the protection of the British courts in fear of their lives.    But the judge in my case was willing to accept that the sharia system in Dubai provided a woman like me with a fair hearing.    In a British court room  I was accused of being ‘intelligent’  and ‘articulate’  and the judge decided that undermined my credibility as a genuine victim of abuse. I felt constantly ridiculed.     Hearing a British judge say that I didn’t look like someone “under the coercive control of the husband” was extremely distressing.     My case was argued extensively in France  all the way up to the Supreme Court. They were provided with the same information as the British Courts. At no point did the French judges indulge in any victim blaming.    Dubai's sharia laws have been roundly condemned by both the UN and by European courts  for unfair trials and discriminatory treatment towards women. But that didn't seem to matter in a court room in London - and now I face financial ruin because I'm (still) fighting for justice.    Whatever happens  I will never stop fighting for Louis. I know that there are lots of people out there who feel like I do  and who believe in the principle of a fair and just British system.

Donations of any size will help contribute towards this event.      The money will go directly towards serving a hot breakfast  lunch and dinner  refreshments  hostels & accomodation   sound healing therapy  recovery workshops  folk music performers and dance organizers  toiletries and gift bags containing daily essentials.    Any donation small or large would be greatly appreciated  all of which will go towards making a special day for those in need.       If you would like to get involved and help that would be greatly appreciated too. Just send us a message.      It is so easy to detach yourself from the suffering on the streets around you. Many of those who have ended up homeless have endured a life long struggle of mental illness or have fled a war zone. Instead of receiving love and care these people have been rejected by society and ended up in vulnerable situations.  Therefore even if it is only for day  our aim is to give hope and reassurance that it is never too late.    'Rumi’s Cave' is a non-defined social space open to all to reflect and share.     Inspired by the legacy of Rumi it aims to provide the cultural  social and spiritual foundations; to nurture individuals  revive communities and build bridges in society.    ‘Be a lamp  or a lifeboat  or a ladder.

Shortly after  Storm Dennis hit and left their home under 4ft of water. Like others affected  this has caused imeasurable damage and left them without a home. Llewie has comphrehensive and complex needs as a result of his severe disabilities.      Llewie was born well  but aquired his disabilities and illnesses as a result of complications during what should have been a routine surgery at 6 weeks old. This left him with 80% of his brain damaged and life long implications for both him and his mum. Khloe is a single parent and had to manage his therapies  and medical needs all on her own. Recently  she has support from carers to help with Llewies complex and varying needs.      He has spent his whole life in and out of hospital having surgeries and treatments and needed a safe and clean home to return to. Due to his needs  suitable accomodation options were limited and luckily they found a home that met Llewie's medical and legal requirements  but also provided Khloe with much needed respite.         Overnight  years worth of critical medical and adaptive equipment as well as the majority of their belongings were destroyed by flooding. As medically required  his bedroom was on the ground floor which meant that the most important posessions were lost.         We have now discovered that none of this is covered by their insurance  so we are asking for any contribution to help get them back on their feet.

Precious wanted the below published to tell you her story  written by herself:    My name is Precious Makai. I am 21 years old from Livingstone/Zambia. I completed my high school education in 2015. Life has not been treating me good my whole life. I have passed through pain  tears and sorrow. I completed my high school education through the money my parents saved from the vegetables my elder siblings and I sold on the streets. As years went on  in 2018  my family and I became homeless. We ran out of shelter  out in the streets whilst my Mother has been sick for 15 years. People have humiliated and abandoned us because what we have been through. As you are reading this right now  my family and I live in a house which is unfinished. It has open windows and open doors. It is such a shame to see my Father cry (he has just recovered from surgery because he has coiled intestines). Our house in the bush is near the zoo  it is quite dangerous. Animals from the zoo  like elephants  break out of the zoo and roam freely. A number of people in my province have been killed by elephants. We have no electricity  no running water and no security. I'm kindly pleading and asking for help from each and everyone who comes across this. Please help me go to university next year  January. Kindly sympathise with me and wake me up from this nightmare of pain  tears and sorrow. I am beginning to lose hope. I dream of changing the standard of living for my family and want to inspire youth in Zambia to never give up on their dreams. I believe education is the key to success. I volunteered on the ICS programme with Ravina in September 2019. It taught me that  no-one has ever become poor by giving. Thank you so much in advance.Precious has been accepted to study (BSc)Nursing at Chreso University to start January 2021.

Westminster is known globally for amazing student fashion and is one of the top places to be  in order to succeed further in any fashion career.   Anybody who knows me  will tell you just how much I love menswear fashion and textiles and how hard I work for all of my education to be able to launch myself into this field. Accepting this offer was extremely exciting  yet daunting. I knew many more sacrifices were going to be needed and a huge financial chunk would need to come from my pocket too.   Whilst this is such an exciting time  it comes at a price - a very expensive one. I have applied for a Student Loan  which covers the cost of £10 000  which is the maximum. However  my Masters Degree is going to cost me £20 000 as it is a two year course.  I have applied for numerous scholarships  some I have succeeded with  others I have not. I have managed to save a huge lump sum through my own money  which has made a considerable dent towards the sum.   I have funded every project so far on my own  which I have passed and funded my own travel to London everyday too.  I am very much doing this on my own.   However  no matter how many hours I put into my little part time job  it still isn't enough and for this year  I owe the remaining amount. I have until the end of July to make this remaining payment.    I am fully committed to making it far with this degree  which is full time.. working all the hours in the studio  commuting daily to London and putting all my blood sweat and tears into it.  It means sacrificing a lot of time with my little boy as a single mother and prior to Covid-19  putting in as many hours I could with my part-time job.   I do this  without complaint because I love what I do.     I have a First Class Honours Degree in Fashion Textiles  Foundation Diploma in Art & Design at Distinction Level  BTEC Art & Design at Distinction Level and all of my GCSE's. Along the way I have been awarded Student of the Year and have numerous scholarships under my belt. I have had fantastic opportunities to work and intern for amazing designers  teach the homeless with my creativity skills and have gained valuable experience throughout the industry through collaborations etc. These achievements have come at an immense price with love and continuous commitment.     This is the final push to get to where I want to be in this field and I am so very determined to get there  but it will require the kindness of peoples hearts to help fund the remaining amount for this year  so I can continue onto my final year of the degree.   Everybody who knows me  will tell you how much LOVE I have for it all  that this is my DREAM and means so much to me! I work on repeat.. raise my son  study  go to work.     I want to set examples to lead by for my little boy to look up to and prove to him  that whatever the sacrifice for the commitment  dive straight in head first and make it work  no matter what. Not only am I doing this for my love for the industry  but to provide my little one a future.     With the unfortunate matter of Covid-19  I am now finding it difficult to save money towards this final sum. Any donations of any kind would be exceptional and so very much appreciated  or even just to read my story and share.     I am trying exceptionally hard to provide and improve myself with the skills needed for my future in Menswear and Textiles  whilst raising my son in a safe secure home.  Thank you so much for taking the time to read  share or donate - it will forever be appreciated.    Much love to all..  Jasmine Thompson  MA Menswear First Year Student",False

We have decided to set ourselves a challenge and give back to the community  hopefully putting a smile on some faces. Did you know? * Of deaths involving the coronavirus (COVID-19) in England and Wales registered up to 26 June 2020  16 were identified as people who were homeless. * Of these  all 16 were identified in England and none were identified in Wales. * Most of the 16 identified deaths were of men  and the mean age at death was 58 years for males. * London (6 out of 16) and the North West (3 out of 16) were the regions with the highest numbers of identified deaths involving COVID-19 among people who were homeless. * These data have been developed rapidly; the official statistics of homeless deaths from all causes for 2020 will be published in late 2021. PLAN OF ACTION - We are looking to raise money for us to make care packages/boxes for the homeless. The vision is to pack some boxes with essential items such as dried food  pads/tampons for the ladies  socks  hygiene products  pet food (if required) waterproof ponchos and water. Depending how much money we can raise we would love to buy blankets  gloves and hats. This winter is going to be a tough one  especially for those on the streets. We will plan a date in December to go out and find those on the streets  handing them their care packages...

Funding is focussed on  but not limited to four principles: Welfare  Happiness  Education & Nutrition (WHEN).     A small foundation  we guarantee via testimonials  and updates from our partner-institutions (in India  Malawi and Sierra Leone) that 100% of all funds raised go directly to improving the lives of children in desperate need.   KCF's founder works closely with the three main supported charities on the ground in India  Malawi and at present: Sierra Leone  to ensure the funding has the most effective and direct impact possible.    KCF is continuously supporting WIDE Children's Home in Tamil Nadu  India via the following campaigns: ""The Daily Milk Initiative""  ""The Daily Fruit and Veg Initiative"" and ""The Christmas Wishes Campaign"". In all we're providing 920 cups of milk a month  660 helpings of fruit/veg a month  a fieldtip every 6 months  and a gift  card and party bag for every child at the home this Christmas (2016).    We also fulfilled a 'Christmas Shoebox Campaign' in partnership with GE Avation for 'Little Leapers Primary School in Malawi run by the small British charity: Butterfly Space. As well as continually providing Butterfly Space with 1 000 bowls of porridge per month to feed its infants at their nursery. For some of the babies and toddlers who attend their charity-funded nursery a bowl of porridge will be their only source of food that day.    Maybe our most urgent and life-saving work of late has been to provide emergency relief and support to Don Bosco in Freetown  Sierra Leone. Usually a children's home to 28 street boys and 30 child sex workers  their numbers soared to over 300 (!) after a fire in a local slum wiped out all 154 shacks. The fire left over 1 000 inhabitants homeless - Don Bosco thankfully took in the most vunerable 300 children and women with babies.   KCF in partnership with Planting Promise has been on the ground since day one; providing truckloads of fresh food and water  and spending each weekend entertaining the children with activities  games  arts & crafts. We also managed to scrape enough money together for a small gift for each child at Christmas - probably the only thing they got this Christmas.    Our biggest project to date though started in February 2017. KCF is building not one or two but FIVE new classrooms to compliment a three-roomed school in a rural Sierra Leonean village called Rogboro.   In addition to this  in May 2017 we launched a feeding program at the school to ensure all children registering a -3 or -2 Z-Score recieve a free and nutritious meal at school each day.    For a small foundation we're achieving BIG things and have even BIGGER plans  and that's why we're asking you to show some love and support by committing to donate a small amount of money - as a one off via gofundme  or as many supporters do: each month via direct debit - to The Kids' Crusade Foundation to allow us to continue this direct  life-changing (saving in some cases) system of support to some of the world's most vunerable children.

Chris is 42 years old and until the beginning of November he had no idea he was ill. He went to hospital after developing a loss of sensation to his left hand and face and after a week of tests and investigations  we were devastated to learn that Chris had bowel cancer which has spread to his brain. He was told it was inoperable. This has all happened so incredibly quickly and we are still trying to process what this means for the family.     As well as being a devoted family man Chris is a creative and inspirational teacher who is well loved by his pupils and respected by his peers. They have an amazingly supportive and caring network of friends  family  pupil parents and colleagues who are providing food  childcare and moral support  ensuring their short-term needs are taken care of.      My worry and theirs  is for their long term future. Despite all their hard work  the demands of a growing family and other issues beyond their control  mean they still live in accommodation “on site” at the school in Northamptonshire  where Chris has taught for the past 11 years. Their dream has always been to have a home of their own where they could bring up their family  a home where they could grow  be happy and create memories.    Chris has just completed a course of whole head radiotherapy. He will be starting chemotherapy in January  to try and slow down the progress of the disease  and give the family as much time as possible to build those all important memories together. Whatever the future holds they deserve the chance of a home away from the constant stress and worry of living in accommodation that is dependent on Chris’ job. A place where the family can feel secure without the fear that they could become homeless in the event of him becoming too ill to work.     This is obviously a major worry for them at a time when they need all their strength to focus on the fight ahead.    Chris is being incredibly strong and positive through all this but he needs to know his precious family has a secure future.    Chris video update 4th December    My aim for this appeal is to help my son and his family by raising some money towards a deposit and possibly a few months rent or mortgage payments on a suitable house that could become the family home they so desperately need.

Her name is Lin and if karma were real  she would not be living the Hell she's currently in. But what I've learnt in the last few months is that cancer doesn't care who it attacks. Cancer sucks  no doubt about it. It doesn't discriminate or give a crap that she's spent her life helping others. It's aggressive and violent  it's heartbreaking and ruthless. And while she's fighting this vicious disease with every ounce of strength  treatment is expensive and we need help to pay to continue the fight. Lin's insurance has paid up for treatment until now but she needs further radiation as her mouth cancer is very aggressive and has quickly and demonically spread from her tongue to her lymph nodes and into her neck. She doesn't want to ask for help and would think that asking you for help would be bad karma. What's more  she would be adament that there are more deserving causes. What she doesn't realise is that she herself is a deserving cause and it's not because I'm bias. Please let me tell you about her. She spends her days visiting hospitals for mamed street dogs  going to small local temples to pray with the monks and make donations. She raises money for local rescue charities who provide emergency care. She's currently in her hospital bed weighing 34kgs and is busy knitting wool hats. She spends days at a local charity for children with various mental and physical disabilities  feeding the children  playing with them and making them smile. She has rescued cats from holes  dogs from the street  stops to feed the homeless  organises donations to local orphanages. I've known her for many years and she has always donated time and money to every good cause she can find and now please please help me to get her the treatment she needs. The cancer began on her tongue and was growing very fast. Her radiation therapy dates were quickly brought forward and she has now had multiple rounds of chemo and radiation. She is just 42 years young and since the last round of radiation which badly burnt her skin on her neck leaving her with open wounds that need constant care from her elderly mother  she now only weighs 34kgs. Her insurance has recently run out and her family who run a farm are paying for her treatment which is not sustainable. Her partner Black is also paying every baht possible towards her treatment  as are all of her friends. However we now need to spread that net. I'm asking for anyone who can afford to spare a few pounds to please help the kindest  purest  most genuinely beautiful person I've ever met. She can beat it but not without further treatment and for that I really need some outside help from anyone who can. Thank you so much and anyone who donates I'll be giving everyone regular updates on her battle. If you are unable to donate  please just take some time to do something kind for someone else today instead as this is something that will give Lin some comfort. She needs to beat cancer's ass because the world needs more Lins in it. FAO GO FUND ME: 1. My name is Katherine (Katie) Walsh 2. I'm originally from Milton Keynes. I live in Cornwall now having moved back from living in Thailand just under 3 years ago. 3. The person I am fundraising for is my best friend who lives in Thailand. 4. She needs to use the funds raised to pay for more treatment to beat the agressive cancer she has as her insurance has finished paying out.

What do you think Christmas lights look like?   On our recent visit to Rwanda  one of the things that most moved my friend Dan Richardson and I was meeting a homeless widow who had had a house built for her through a tourist project. She proudly showed us her home and also a single light bulb she'd been given which had transformed her life.   Most villagers there still rely on kerosene lamps which provide very poor light and also have terrible effects on health from eye-sight to lungs (I read the other day using a kerosene lamp is the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day). For around $15/£11 a new solar lightbulb can transform home  health and bring life to a village after dark. So simple.   After seeing that  the consumerism of Christmas and the endless drive for gifts back in the UK has been a bit of a shock to adjust back to. My friends and family have been asking what I would like as a gift and I've now arrived at my answer. I'd like solar light bulbs please and that's what I will be giving many people too.   We'd like to open up that opportunity to you guys too. Our aim is to  by Christmas  pay for 100 bulbs for a village in Rwanda.

The location is near the Danube River  where our 3 amazing volunteers live! All of the cats and dogs they save everyday are taken to their own homes  in their own yards  but they live in busy neighbourhoods  they don't have too much space and it can get very difficult at times to manage all of the animals as well as their personal/work life. Needless to say the neighbours don't quite appreciate the commotion  sometimes noise/smell - and our volunteers cannot just walk past animals needing help  they feel they have a duty of care to help the injured  to house the homeless and feed the hungry.     It would be so much easier if we could help these 3 amazing ladies  Teodora + Selena + Gabriela  acquire a lot near Drobeta Turnu-severin (their home town) where they could build an animal shelter with all of the necessities and keep helping more and more animals  with much more space and definitely less worries!    The average price for a lot with such purpose would be around £8 000. It is indeed a lot of money  however we are confident and determined to make this happen as this could save so many lives. Abandonment in Romania is increasing  people just won't learn  and our volunteers are simply overwhelmed with the number of animals coming into their care - they could of course refuse the cases  but this just means animals will die on the streets  in agony  or brutally killed in the public shelter. The hearts of rescuers who see such horror everyday shatter in millions of pieces  but still they come back stronger than ever to help more and more forgotten souls.

The Rev Mandy Brown and her team at Holy Trinity Church in South Street offer practical and emotional comfort and support to those in need.    It cost £28 000 to run the shelter last year. The tight budget means manager David Perry is employed for just 13 hours a week  but he dedicates many more to reaching out to homeless people as soon as the team become aware of their difficulties.    Rev Brown said: ""We are unable to open all year round because the number of volunteers we would need would be phenomenal. We would need a huge amount of money to pay a full-time manager and we just don't have it.""    However  with the help of up to 300 volunteers  they are able to offer a safe haven each night during the worst of the winter for up to 12 guests.    Rev Brown is anxious that the help offered is more than a temporary sticking plaster.    ""Once we open we will keep going to the end of March – we have a very long season  one of the longest [of any winter night shelter] "" she said.    ""Experience tells us that the worst of the bad weather comes later than it used to. But we use that time to be able to work with people and to help people connect and reconnect. We need the time to build up the trust and the love that's required to be able to work with someone.    ""Just providing a roof over somebody's head does not resolve the challenges they are facing. It's just the beginning. The shelter is a conduit to other resources – to housing  to drug and alcohol rehabilitation and even using the contact centre to reconnect people to their children and families "" she said. That support continues even when guests are off the street.    As part of its mission to provide the best possible services  the shelter is regularly inspected by Housing Justice and was rated 'excellent' at the last visit. ""We are very proud of that "" said Rev Brown. ""We work very closely with Housing Justice and we follow all their guidelines.""    Each day  the shelter  now a registered charity  needs two overnight volunteers each night  three lunchtime and four evening helpers  plus an extra pair of hands during the day to collect food donated by businesses. Those who can spare just a few hours to play cards or board games or just chat are very welcome.    David said: ""You don't have to know how to resolve someone's issues – just come and be a friend.""    He is training volunteers who have already come forward but is anxious to recruit more and set up induction sessions for them too.    Not all roles are client-facing – the shelter also needs help with laundry  housekeeping  pantry stock rotation and preparing meals on the premises each evening. New recruits to the catering crew have been busy securing food hygiene certificates.    Rev Brown said: ""It's wonderful to come in out of the cold and for the guests to smell home-cooked meals coming out of the kitchen.""    The shelter's doors open each night from 8pm and guests leave at 7.30am  unless the weather is particularly bad. Lunch is on offer from 11am until 2pm. The shelter offers activities such as art therapy as well as advice on issues including mental health and addiction.    Over the past five years  since the shelter first opened  the team have built up a wealth of practical experience and a network of experts who can help address the complex issues which lead to an individual living on the streets.    They work closely with Citizens Advice  Bishop's Stortford Food Bank at the Methodist church  alcohol and drug rehabilitation professionals and East Herts Council's housing options officer for rough sleepers.    The team also partner with other churches  such as the Salvation Army  which provides vouchers so shelter-users can pick their own clothes from the good cause's shop in South Street.    David has a small selection of garments so that anyone turning up in wet clothes can change into something dry  warm and clean  but because space is tight  the shelter is unable to store donations of clothes  which are best directed to the town's charity shops.    The shelter has ample supplies of towels and beddings and uses special fold-up beds  which can be cleaned easily.    It does  however  always welcome donations of tea  coffee and biscuits  which are always in short supply  plus books and games for the guests.

I am friends with a homeless man  Darryl and his dog Max. They have recently become victims of some thugs who have beaten up Darryl and stabbed little Max. Thankfully Max is ok and will make a full recovery.    Every day they sit on Dundas Street outside Margiottas. Darryl does not ask for money but is always happy to chat to anyone who stops to talk to him. He does not drink and does not do drugs. Darryl has been homeless for 3 years and does not qualify for any benefits.    People have been great about helping out with food  drinks and clothes  which he really appreciates. Now through raising awareness we have a chance to make a real and permanent difference to their lives. If everyone who reads this just gives a little bit we can use it for rent on a flat so he can then go on to claim benefits and get himself back on his feet. Darryl wants to become self sufficient  so please give him a little hand up and donate what you feel you can.    Thank you for reading and helping a vulnerable friend.",False

We will be partaking in several events to bring awareness and raise as much money as possible for my chosen charities.    The Steve Bull Foundation provides charitable support in the form of grants to organisations primarily in the Black Country and the West Midlands which specialise in assisting young people  the disabled  the homeless  the sick and the disadvantaged.     I have been training for just over 9 months. If you had told me I would be doing these events a year ago  I probably would have laughed as I couldn't even run 100 meters back then! This is a huge achievement for me personally.    THE FOLLOWING CHARITIES I HAVE CHOSEN TO SUPPORT ARE:     Birmingham Childrens Hospital Charity - In 2013 my daughter Elle had a serious accident which resulted in her breaking her pelvis in 8 places. With the help of BCH she was able to receive fantastic care and support which ultimately saved her life. The hospital itself cares for all ages of children and many illnesses and it's important they receive vital funds to make a real difference to children and their families - ""Because every patient deserves a childhood.""     Cure Leukaemia - As a huge Wolves fan it is no doubt that Carl Ikeme's story really touched myself and many people around me. I want to support this wonderful charity and make direct impact to anybody who has been affected by Leukemia.     Good Shepherd Ministry Wolverhampton - I don't believe anybody in 2019 should be homeless. Good Shepherd assist men  women and children gain freedom from homelessness  poverty  rejection and isolation. Open 7 days a week.

He’s the most upbeat  positive  amazing man who’s life has literally turned upside down by a twist of fate. He has split with his partner and found himself homeless. With no means of fixing this quickly  he’s offering a gardening and handyman service whilst sleeping rough and wild camping. The good weather won’t last long and with nowhere to call home he will struggle to get a private let. Without clean clothes and electricity  work will dry up. This could happen to any of us so easily and just a small donation from a few people will make a huge difference. I’m hoping to raise enough to pay for a room in a shared house via air bnb and a deposit for Sy to get a home of his own. A short term air bnb let will give him means to live and earn and provide an address and a reference for a bank account and a new home. Anything over and above these needs will begiven directly to Sy to start his life. Thank you in advance for any amount. Victoria. ",False
