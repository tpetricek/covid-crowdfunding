We also make a daily delivery to the MAGPAS Air Ambulance based at Wyton and East Anglian Air Ambulance based at Cambridge Airport.&nbsp; Our volunteers operate from 7pm at night until 6am weekdays, all day and night at weekends and on Bank Holidays. Since this voluntary organisation started in 2010 providing a vitally important service completely free of charge, we have carried out more than 7000 delivery runs, which last year it is estimated to have saved the NHS over £80,000 allowing the NHS to divert funds where they are needed most. Our hospitals make between 2 and 7 calls per night to us and our duty controllers liaise with our volunteers and similar organisations throughout the UK to complete the task requested.  We have just over 100 dedicated volunteers who give their time, mostly use their own motorcycles or cars and pay for their own fuel. SERV Suffolk and Cambridgeshire receives no government funding, its costs being met by donations from members of the public, local businesses, charitable grants and awards. We do not have any paid staff. Our main costs include supplying our volunteers with safety equipment, insurance and maintenance for our charity vehicles and paying for communications between our hospitals and ourselves.  In 2019 we have committed to replacing our two aging fund-raising team vehicles.  One based in Cambridgeshire and one based in Suffolk.  It is estimated that this cost will be £30 000.  In 2019, SERV Suffolk and Cambridgeshire were awarded the Queen's Award for Voluntary Services for providing free transport of essential blood products, samples and donated breast milk to hospitals and air ambulances.  This award is the equivalent to an MBE and is the highest award a voluntary group can receive in the UK.","2020-11-09 10/2020-11-03 10/2020-11-01 20/2020-10-31 15/2020-10-28 10/2020-10-23 100/2020-10-16 20/2020-10-16 10/2020-10-16 20/2020-10-15 100/2020-10-15 10/2020-10-14 20/2020-10-14 10/2020-10-14 100/2020-10-14 100/2020-10-09 20/2020-10-09 15/2020-10-09 10/2020-10-09 20/2020-10-07 25/2020-10-07 20/2020-10-07 20/2020-10-07 10/2020-10-07 3/2020-10-05 25/2020-10-05 100",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=CurtisBanksTeamSales&pageUrl=1&isTeam=true,2020-11-09,"Throughout Wales",,838

Our housing experts give advice and support by phone or email, or face-to-face at our network of housing aid centres and in county courts and outreach centres.   We also have specialist projects that provide long term support to people who are trying to escape bad housing and homelessness.   Shelter tackles the root causes of bad housing by lobbying government and local authorities for new laws and policies, and more investment, to improve the lives of homeless and badly housed people.  Our influential campaigns bring aspects of bad housing to the attention of the media and the public, who  help us fight for solutions.   Shelter believes that everybody needs a home in a place they can thrive. Our work won’t stop until there is a home for everyone.",,https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=DonnaBanks2&pageUrl=1,,,,0

This was a major challenge undertaken in unprecedented circumstances, achieved through hard work, collaboration and decisive action. Now, our priority is to secure Project Trust's future. The costs of repatriation and some of the extraordinary lengths to which we went to secure the safe return of our young people, combined with uncertainty due to the impact of the Coronavirus, is significantly impacting on our work.  Project Trust’s future is threatened and we need your help. We are appealing to the whole Project Trust Family for all the support and donations you can give. Your Best Year  Project Trust is in it's 53rd year, which in itself is impressive. But our real successes lie in the impact on the overseas Communities in which our Volunteers live and work, the personal development of Volunteers, and the many ways in which Returned Volunteers have then applied their experiences to everyday life. Society has never needed globally-aware young people with an empathy and understanding for cultures and peoples more than it does right now. Safeguarding Project Trust’s future together will allow future generations of young people to experience unique overseas opportunities we have offered across 67 countries since 1967. That is why doing Project Trust is an adventure like no other. And that is why we know how much you care about Project Trust and how much you, whether as a Volunteer, Parent or Friend value the experiences on offer.   With that in mind, please give generously.

We also fund local research and buy equipment to improve patient care. All our services are free. During the Coronavirus pandemic, we redesigned our services so that we could continue to offer support for those in need. COVID-19 limited face-to-face contact with the people we support because access to our centres has been severely impacted. But counselling for individuals and families, information and advice on claiming benefits and how to exercise safely are all available on the phone or via video calls. We have also introduced online support groups and produced new resources to offer as wide a range of help as possible. Since the charity was founded in 1987, we have raised £22million for support, equipment and research. FORCE receives no regular Government or NHS funding. We need to raise £1.7million every year to maintain the services we offer. That money comes almost entirely from voluntary contributions - legacies, donations, the FORCE charity shop and from fundraising events.

We award one scholarship per year for a taught Masters degree. A South African undergraduate scholarship was set up by staff and students at Durham University in 1964, the year in which Nelson Mandela was imprisoned and the anti-apartheid campaigner, journalist and researcher Ruth First was forced to go into exile in England. The scholarship was named in honour of Ruth First after she was murdered by South African police in 1982. She was a Lecturer in Sociology at Durham University and had been seconded to Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique. Since the end of apartheid, the Scholarship has been awarded for postgraduate study, and in 2007 we widened its scope to include applicants from Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. We choose people who show evidence of both academic promise and community leadership. People who have been active in voluntary and charity work, community initiatives, health and educational projects. Ruth First Scholars make the most of the amazing opportunity of enhancing their skills and knowledge at a leading UK university to benefit not only themselves but their communities and countries. The Ruth First Scholarship is supported by Durham University, Durham County Council and other sponsors, as well as by individual donations from staff and alumni of the University and people from the Durham area. However, we urgently need to increase the Trust's income in order to ensure that this small but powerful contribution to development in southern Africa can continue.

This remote region of 39,000 people has no electricity, no running water and is severely affected by the HIV & AIDS epidemic. There are no other NGOs (non-governmental organisations) working in the region and the local government strongly encouraged Temwa to work in this area due to its desperate need for basic development.  Temwa’s initial projects were in Usisya, which is made up of 56 villages. The first project undertaken was to build a community centre in Usisya, which is where Temwa's headquarters are. Temwa has recently expanded to cover the whole of Nkhata Bay North, which incorporates 89 villages.  Overseen by a project manager in Malawi, Temwa consists of a series of programmes that are aimed at providing sustainable community-driven development in four key areas: Health Education Skills Development Agriculture and Irrigation Schools Support Temwa works to provide hope for the future among the people of Malawi by: -providing an infrastructure to support Malawian families facing financial and humanitarian hardship, irrespective of religious orientation. -creating partnerships and programs to equip the local population with the skills and resources to ensure ongoing health, education and financial stability for families and the wider community.","2020-11-03 75/2020-11-02 30/2020-11-02 30",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=CarolineBeckett1&pageUrl=2,2020-11-03,"Bolton, Bury, Manchester City, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford City, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan",,135

EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by three full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.   EFP operates 8 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme. Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances. Each food pack provides at least three meals/per day for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave). In 2019-20, we provided 16,984 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 73% increase on the previous year. We were able to do so by receiving 190,000kg of food from donations. Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps. Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres.  Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.

We provide radiotherapy through one of the largest radiotherapy departments in the world; chemotherapy on site and through 14 other hospitals; highly specialist surgery for complex and rare cancer; and a wide range of support and diagnostic services. We are also an international leader in research, with world first breakthroughs for over 100 years.  We run one of the largest early clinical trial units in Europe with over 300 trials every year. Our charity raises money to fund projects at The Christie which are outside the scope of the NHS.

EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by three full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.   EFP operates 8 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme. Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances. Each food pack provides at least three meals/per day for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave). In 2019-20, we provided 16,984 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 73% increase on the previous year. We were able to do so by receiving 190,000kg of food from donations. Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps. Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres.  Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.

Temwa operates in an area called Nkhata Bay North, on the shores of Lake Malawi.  This remote region of 39,000 people has no electricity, no running water and is severely affected by the HIV & AIDS epidemic. There are no other NGOs (non-governmental organisations) working in the region and the local government strongly encouraged Temwa to work in this area due to its desperate need for basic development.  Temwa’s initial projects were in Usisya, which is made up of 56 villages. The first project undertaken was to build a community centre in Usisya, which is where Temwa's headquarters are. Temwa has recently expanded to cover the whole of Nkhata Bay North, which incorporates 89 villages.  Overseen by a project manager in Malawi, Temwa consists of a series of programmes that are aimed at providing sustainable community-driven development in four key areas: Health Education Skills Development Agriculture and Irrigation Schools Support Temwa works to provide hope for the future among the people of Malawi by: -providing an infrastructure to support Malawian families facing financial and humanitarian hardship, irrespective of religious orientation. -creating partnerships and programs to equip the local population with the skills and resources to ensure ongoing health, education and financial stability for families and the wider community.","2020-11-01 15/2020-10-29 10/2020-10-28 10/2020-10-27 10/2020-10-26 15/2020-10-25 15/2020-10-25 10/2020-10-25 10/2020-10-25 10/2020-10-24 10/2020-10-24 20/2020-10-24 10/2020-10-24 20/2020-10-24 30/2020-10-24 10/2020-10-23 35/2020-10-23 20/2020-10-23 5/2020-10-23 10/2020-10-23 30/2020-10-23 3/2020-10-23 30/2020-10-23 10/2020-10-22 100/2020-10-22 15/2020-10-22 10/2020-10-21 45/2020-10-21 10/2020-10-21 25/2020-10-21 20/2020-10-21 30/2020-10-21 25/2020-10-21 15/2020-10-21 30/2020-10-21 10/2020-10-21 10/2020-10-21 20/2020-10-21 20/2020-10-21 10/2020-10-21 10/2020-10-21 20/2020-10-21 10/2020-10-21 15/2020-10-21 25/2020-10-21 5/2020-10-21 10/2020-10-20 15/2020-10-20 100/2020-10-20 5/2020-10-20 25/2020-10-20 15/2020-10-20 30/2020-10-20 30/2020-10-20 5/2020-10-20 15/2020-10-20 10/2020-10-20 10/2020-10-20 50/2020-10-20 20/2020-10-20 10/2020-10-20 30/2020-10-20 2/2020-10-20 10/2020-10-20 2/2020-10-20 10/2020-10-20 10/2020-10-20 50/2020-10-20 10/2020-10-20 100/2020-10-19 15/2020-10-19 25/2020-10-19 5/2020-10-19 10/2020-10-19 10/2020-10-19 20/2020-10-19 20/2020-10-19 20/2020-10-19 5/2020-10-19 15/2020-10-19 1/2020-10-19 10/2020-10-19 10/2020-10-19 15/2020-10-19 5/2020-10-19 15/2020-10-19 10/2020-10-19 20/2020-10-19 15/2020-10-19 10/2020-10-19 30/2020-10-19 30/2020-10-19 15/2020-10-19 30/2020-10-19 20/2020-10-19 15/2020-10-19 15/2020-10-19 20/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-18 20/2020-10-18 30/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-18 30/2020-10-18 15/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-18 30/2020-10-18 20/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-18 15/2020-10-18 15/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-18 20/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-18 30/2020-10-18 20/2020-10-18 15/2020-10-18 20/2020-10-18 30/2020-10-18 20/2020-10-18 40/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-18 20/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-18 5/2020-10-18 20/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-18 20/2020-10-18 20/2020-10-18 20/2020-10-18 15/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-18 15/2020-10-18 10/2020-10-18 20/2020-10-17 15/2020-10-17 10/2020-10-17 15/2020-10-17 20/2020-10-17 10/2020-10-17 30/2020-10-17 30/2020-10-17 10/2020-10-17 10/2020-10-17 20/2020-10-17 30/2020-10-17 30/2020-10-17 30/2020-10-16 15/2020-10-16 30/2020-10-16 30/2020-10-16 20/2020-10-16 10/2020-10-16 15/2020-10-16 15/2020-10-16 50/2020-10-16 10/2020-10-16 20/2020-10-16 20/2020-10-15 15/2020-10-15 20/2020-10-15 5/2020-10-15 15/2020-10-15 10/2020-10-15 20/2020-10-15 10/2020-10-15 10/2020-10-15 10/2020-10-15 20/2020-10-15 50/2020-10-15 10/2020-10-15 30/2020-10-15 10/2020-10-15 10/2020-10-15 10",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=Yr6WOTKilimanjaroKids&pageUrl=2,2020-11-01,"Bolton, Bury, Manchester City, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford City, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan",,3676
