We live in a nation where more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. The Trussell Trust has given out over 1.6 million packs of food supplies in the past year alone. Food Banks are not just a place to pick up essential sustenance  with cuts to community centres and frontline services they have also become mini-welfare and advice centres.    We're aiming to raise £5000 before Christmas 2019  which will go to the Trussell Trust. Your donation will directly help those most in need of support. It is vital that those working in publishing come together as a community and take action.    It is important to help those in greatest need but solutions must also be found to the reasons people find themselves in need of food banks.    The Trussell Trust’s CEO Emma Revie has indicated that the benefits system has been driving a rise in foodbank use– the charity released their State of Hunger 2019 report in November.    “This is the busiest six months we’ve ever seen – more people than ever before are being forced to foodbanks’ doors ” said Revie. “Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty  but currently thousands of women  men and children are not receiving sufficient protection from destitution. This is not right. But we know this situation can be fixed – our benefits system could be the key to unlocking people from poverty. We need to put money back into the pockets of people who most need our support. It’s in our power as a country to end the need for foodbanks. This can change.”        Thank you for your support.

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.    All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.

On Sunday 8th we had one such issue: A power surge through the dojo which has blown all the electrics and everything in the building! Just what we didn’t need! Although we are currently closed due to the national lockdown. I attend the gym daily  keep it clean  prepare lesson plans and of course make myself available for those dropping off for our foodbank and for those who are also collecting from our foodbank. I also use the space to record exclusive video content for our students. This power surge has meant no power or heat and even the electric shutters failed  meaning we couldn’t gain access. With no help from the local council  this financial burden has hit us hard. This is worrying for us with no financial support. Planning a way of recovering from this  in our attempt to keep the gym going in this unprecedented time  has left us with sleepless nights. Some friends and students have already dropped in  and we are not above accepting help and will always accept it gratefully.   Thankfully  our motto is “Inspire  Believe  Achieve” we will not be defeated! We will continue to help our community as best we can. Managing our foodbank for those that have been hit hard during these challenging times. Creating a safe space for people who need to deal with their mental health and well-being. Providing martial arts classes  online content and training for all our loyal students. Whilst we wait for contractors to complete work. We are assured that we will gain access to the building soon. Hopefully  we can resume classes as of December 2nd! Now  more than ever  our students need access to train (after lockdown). Be in an environment which is beneficial to their mental health and well-being.   We couldn’t agree more and will do our utmost to make sure the gym is available whatever tier we end up in.

To date; the following causes have been supported;     Since the Robin Hood Fund launched we have had one clear goal  to raise much needed funds to support the most vulnerable people in Nottingham during the Covid-19 crisis.

To date; the following causes have been supported:      Foodbanks (£20 000)    The Robin Hood Fund has distributed £20 000 in support of food banks across Nottingham. Working closely with Hope Nottingham and Nottingham Forest in the Community to deliver the wider support  food and supplies have been centrally purchased and then distributed to a number of different food banks  including: NG11 Clifton Foodbank  Meadows Foodbank  Grace Church  HOPE Nottingham  Bestwood & Bulwell Foodbank  Himmah / Muslim Hands  Arnold Foodbank and St. Ann’s Advice Centre.      Homeless Organisations (£10 000)    Emmanuel House was awarded £6 000 for additional specialist key worker support to boost its team at a time when Nottingham’s homeless community is at grave risk. This support is helping to ensure the homeless community are being placed into hotel accommodation as an emergency measure as hostels are very vulnerable to outbreaks.       There has also been £4 000 of support released to Framework to enable them to purchase essential items to the Homeless community in Nottingham. This included  but was not limited to  the provision of items such as mobile phones so that they can remain in contact with key workers and minimise the chance of these individuals being unable to stick to the government guidelines on social distancing.       Refugee Groups (£2 500)    Refugee Roots were provided with support to allow them to move from a model that required face to face contact  to being able to still provide support in a safe and socially distanced way.

Vulnerable Women (£4 500)    Nottingham Women's Centre have been awarded funding to help them to provide mental health support and online counselling  including training for counsellors to be able to provide online support.      In addition to this  further support was provided to POW Nottingham  an organisation supporting the rights of sex workers and those at risk of being exploited. This funding enabled them to purchase essential items including food and toiletries.      Disability Groups (£2 500)      With social distancing measures causing increased issues for the disability community in Nottingham  this support has enabled the Disability Support Nottingham organisation to increase its capability to provide phone support - in addition to welfare checks - to those in need.      Vulnerable Young People (£2 500)     Funding has also been provided to help support the amazing work of Nottingham YMCA  who are working with the most vulnerable young people in our city during this crisis.

Once in Nottingham City Council account the funds are ring fenced and held until the decision re: allocation has been made.

This group is tasked with making the biggest impact possible whilst also being certain that the organisations in receipt a) need and b) promise to spend quickly ie. nobody saves the money. On Tuesday of each week the working group will have a paper approved by a member of ‘gold’ and paperwork will be sent to a small governance committee who are tasked with ethics and assuring the highest standards of governance and distribution.

Born in Tripoli  Northern Lebanon and operating in refugee camps in the Bekaa Valley throughout the COVID pandemic  we are now responding to the Beirut blast.     With the full endorsement of the Lebanese Foodbank  each of our ovens is capable of producing over 1 000 meals per day. Our plan is to greatly increase this reach by expanding our number of oven sites nationwide.     Our Work To Date    Today  the Great Oven HQ is located next to the epicenter of the blast site  in Lebanon’s most respected nightclub of all places  the Ballroom Blitz. Each day  between 10 - 20 local volunteers contribute to the preparation of meals and supplies which are then distributed to our oven sites.     Over a month on from the blast  with media fatigue setting in and many temporary relief efforts already withdrawing  our work is crucial. We believe that responses to Lebanon’s escalating crisis must be long term in their vision and center the Lebanese people as agents of their own reconstruction and resilience-building process.    By its very nature  The Great Oven is uniquely positioned to provide assistance through this framework. Not only do we set up enduring networks but our ovens are permanent installations that belong to the communities in which they are based. As centres for cooking  teaching and sharing a meal  our ovens facilitate a creative and participatory experience that brings communities together and fosters social cohesion.     Where will your support go?    The Great Oven has self-funded its operations for over two years. We are proud of our self-sustainability but now feel it is time to grow. We can’t do this without your support.    Each kind donation will be used to fund our basic operational costs  all of which are listed below:    - Production and installation of more community ovens in areas of critical need in Beirut and nationwide  - Sourcing local food produce for each oven  - Distribution of food beyond Great Oven sites across the city  - Oven transport and logistics     Our only paid salaries to date  go to marginalised people we founded our movement with. This includes LGBTQ refugees  stateless youths  trafficked women  and ex child fighters to name a few.     More about the Great Oven    We build great big beautiful ovens to feed a great number of people.     But the oven is also symbolic. It represents our belief that the ritual of cooking and sharing meals helps bring communities together  whatever their faith  ethnicity or gender.     We also believe in the rehabilitative power of music and art to restore faith that a better future is possible.     What we offer is not aid in the traditional sense  but the participatory tools to empower a community to build that future for themselves  and with those tools comes an inherent sense of dignity  which is as important as food relief in nourishing a marginalised community.     We work with grassroots  on-the-ground  local initiatives and organisers in order to respond organically and effectively to each community’s unique needs.     What we’re offering in return     The Great Oven was founded by award-winning cook  documentary filmmaker and philanthropist  James Thompson. Our wider team is a collective of chefs  artists and creative thinkers dedicated to making positive change through food and art.     We are eternally grateful for any donation  no matter how big or small. For any substantial contributions  we would like to offer a very special thank you in true Great Oven style:    Donations of £1 000 or more    A private Great Oven feast cooked by Great Oven chefs (and special guests) at your home.

As the lockdown is eased  some people will be more aware than others that the pandemic is not over.    The most vulnerable people - those who have been shielded  have been receiving food parcels. They have been advised that they no longer have to shield beyond August 16th. We believe that this means that they will no longer get their weekly food parcel.    We are also aware of other people who for whatever reason  can’t get enough food. Predictions are for greater economic squeezes  which means that more people will fall into this category.    Prior to covid  the office of Leanne Wood in Porth had worked with the free-share scheme to offer free food to people who wanted it: this is food that the supermarkets would normally throw away. This food was provided on a non-means tested basis to anyone who could make use of it. (We also worked closely with the Rhondda foodbank to provide non-perishable food to them that they could make use of for people in need).    This scheme has to be put on hold when covid broke because it was not possible to do it while social distancing.    Social distancing is still an issue  but food poverty and food need is a growing problem. With the shielded group no longer having their weekly food parcel from mid August - and with supermarkets sending food to landfill if it can’t be distributed - all means we need to restart the scheme  but do it differently.    This is where you can help.    We need to raise money - around £5 000 should enable us to operate a scheme up until the end of the year.    We can then purchase extra items so that together with the supermarket excess  we can make up balanced food parcels for anyone who asks for one.    We will be relying on our team of Plaid Cymru councillors as well as the network of volunteers to both pack food and deliver it to people throughout the Rhondda.    If you can donate and also share this link on your social media channels  that would help this new project immensely.    Back in March  nearly six hundred people in the Rhondda responded to a call-out to sign up as a community volunteer  to be a part of a network to support and keep an eye out for others in their community as the covid pandemic took hold and people had major concerns about lockdown.    Some of those volunteers carried out weekly shopping and collected monthly prescriptions for their neighbours all the way through lockdown. This Rhondda network demonstrates what a fantastic community we live in. People here have been through so much with floods  precarious economic conditions  the loss of so many important local services - yet we still band together to help those who need it.

The race will follow VERY STRICT SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES  to do this we really need all cars etc to be off the road by 9am on Sunday 26th so the road can be used as the course. We appreciate this can be tricky especially where homes have more than one car. To help  we have contacted The Parrswood Pub to see if we could perhaps park in their car park. If this is something that may be of interest/use to you  please let me know so I can confirm details.

Their lap (s) will finish when they return to their house. This will mean people are kept safe and social distancing will be adhered to at all times! Partipants will use the outside of the road allowing a 2m gap between them and runners running on the other side of the road.     Participants  participate at their own risk.     The footpath will act as a barrier between runners and those spectating/supporting from their drive. Supporters  please ensure you are a minimum of 2meters away from where participants will be passing ie. A minimum of 2 meters from the curb.    3 or 4 people (or in some cases 3 couples or 3 families will participate at the same time) participants will be in groups (allowing for social distancing) and will be given a start time. 1 lap is 451 meters so this will more than allow for social distancing between each participant/houshold. Those running with children under 10  should hold their hand when participating to prevent trips/falls and ensure they don’t jeopardise social distancing measures.    Participants will be categorised (by themselves) into Walkers/Potterers ie. Joggers with kids under 10years  Joggers and Runners and will participate (at their allocated slot) with others in the same category.

Half a Mile Down again!","Ventnor, South East England, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/half-a-mile-up-half-a-mile-down-again,280,200,,2020-10-13,,,0,,"Thank's for checking out my GoFundMe.    On 8/11/20 (Hill Day) I'll be attempting to run up one of the Isle of Wight' s steepest hills as many times as I can in 1 hour to raise money for the Ventnor Community Foodbank.     The initial response from friends has been: 'Why the hell do you want to do that??!' And that's a very good question...    So here's my answer:  I started running here on the Island to keep me sane. After difficult times it gave me a positive frame of mind I could not live without nowadays. During Lockdown it became a way for me to be worthwhile and happy when tens of thousands of people in the UK have struggled to do so in 2020.     The perverse thing is  I started to love running up hills. The steeper the better  I began to relish the challenge! Fortunately  Ventnor is full of the bloody things  and being a masochistic b******d I picked the steepest one with a road on it I could. The Hill With No Name runs 1/2 mile in length up a height of 317 feet (peak is 672 feet above sea level). Seriously  a cable car would be a viable way of getting up it. It's a bit of a monster.    So the plan is to run/walk/crawl as many times up it as possible in 1 hour. My chosen charity is the Ventnor Community Foodbank who do an invaluable job of supporting children and families here. During these trying times they deserve all the help they can get in supporting local people.

We demand the University of Birmingham:  * Gives an above RPI inflation pay increase to all support staff;  * Becomes a Living Wage Accredited employer;  * Eliminates the gender pay gap by 2020;  * Fixes the Support Staff pay spine & allocates a budget for it;  * Negotiates with all unions on the joint unions' report on working conditions at the university (available on our website).    Hundreds of caterers  cleaners  security guards and other support staff who are members of UNISON at the University of Birmingham are in dispute with the University of Birmingham and have taken strike action on the University's Open Day on Friday 28th June as they feel let down by the University’s senior management. Unless the University of Birmingham's senior managers are prepared to address our demands  we will have no other choice but to continue to take strike action.     This strike is notable within the sector  as this is the only union branch in the Higher Education to succeed in taking strike action over the 18-19 negotiations. This comes after almost a year of failed negotiations over fair pay  living wage accreditation  closing the gender pay gap  and meaningful negotiations on a joint report of demands written together with the other trade unions on campus  says UNISON today. More than three quarters of the university staff balloted (79 per cent) voted in favour of strike action over last year’s dispute.    Senior managers at the University have persistently refused to negotiate with the unions and instead imposed a below inflation pay rise (2%) on the majority of staff. The University has also been sluggish to address the gulf between men and women’s salaries at the institution  with women earning on average less than 20% than their male counterparts  have refused to accredit  and have only been ready to restructure the pay spine if the unions were prepared to agree on worse conditions such as sick pay  overtime pay  and holiday entitlements.    The first day of action was held on Friday 28th June  on a very sunny day which was also the University's Open Day: food  music  and joyful discussions over everyone’s vision of the University are being held  and prospective students and their parents are finding out about the struggles staff are facing on campus.     In the absence of accreditation  pay at the university could fall below the Real Living Wage  meaning staff would struggle to make ends meet. ‘We already know that members have turned to foodbanks to feed their families’  says UNISON. ‘Many low-paid staff only work 15 hours per week and often hold several jobs to make ends meet. Senior managers seem happy to promote the excellent research undertaken by academics on social inequalities but are failing to see that they are often driving this inequality through the way they treat their own employees’.    Last year  the University set up a new ‘wholly-owned subsidiary company’ called the Edgbaston Park Hotel  and outsourced 40 staff. The Hotel does not recognise unions for new members (meaning that they cannot take strike action  for instance)  and new staff are being paid only £8.21/hour. Their contracts are much worse compared to those of the University of Birmingham’s employees. This year  Hotel staff received a 1p/hour pay rise  while the University’s VC earns £444 000/year from the University  is waiting to receive a one-off £80 000 bonus  and also receives £90 000/year as Chair of the academic and academic related staff’s USS pensions scheme.

The families are issued with a monthly ration card valid for 12 months which provides them with stock for each month as per the individual needs of the family. These include: 10kg chapati flour (atta)  5kg sugar  5kg various lentils/daal  5kg rice  5L cooking oil  tea leaves  salt  spices and other necessary food items. £25 will feed a family of 5 for the month however any donation  no matter how big or small will impact them greatly.     100% of the donationsgo to those in need  with our incredible staff being voluntary workers (so no wages or salaries are deducted from donations) and our facilities funded with the finances that the late Safdar Hussain Shah left behind for us to carry this out in his legacy- we are relying on your kind donations which will solely provide stock for the families.

It was later discovered that John had suffered a brain aneurysm.         Since John’s (Riveley's) passing the family has been inundated with hundreds of messages. Friends  family and loved ones from every aspect of John’s life have been reaching out with sentiments of their own grief and reflections on his life. Upon meeting John  one would immediately discover a gentle  friendly man whose warmth  cheerful demeanour and genuine kindness is unmatched. John touched so many with his humble  unassuming and selfless acts of service. Wherever there was a need you would find John there  not as the centre of attention  but a driving force to make things happen. What you would have also been aware of is John's deep love for God  and that in all things he put his trust in Him to direct his life  no matter what the circumstances. John leaves behind Julie his wife of 18 years and two young sons Caleb and Joshua  aged 8 and 11. John had a big heart with lots of love to give and also leaves behind two current foster sons and several previous foster children who remained a regular part of his life. John was born on the beautiful island of Mauritius and leaves behind his precious mother affectionately known to many as Grandmère; four siblings  Jenny  James  Donald and Shirley (Little Sis); three neices Karisa  Saphea and Nia; and two nephews  Courtnei and Joseph. John was a role model father and devoted son and brother with his eye keenly fixed on the needs of everyone in the family. John’s untimely passing has unfortunately happened at a time when so many are facing emotional and financial challenges. Millions around the world can relate to our experience of sudden loss. Just over a week ago John’s wife would never have expected to face the significant void that John’s death has left in her life. There have been many offers of support and this go fund me appeal is a practical vehicle for individuals to reach out to Julie  Joshua and Caleb at this difficult time as the family makes arrangements to lay John to rest.       The first video attached provides a tiny glimpse of the unfailing love that John had for his children. His youngest son Caleb  attentive  loyal and constantly by his Dad's side  ready to lap up whatever fun and laughter naturally radiated from the heart of his father.       In the second video attached you will witness a celebration of life. The strength you will see as John’s Eldest son Joshua pays tribute to his father publicly within two hours of hearing the sad news of his passing is remarkable. Joshua’s faith demonstrated through his confidence and composure in the face of such loss is a testimony and a legacy of the life of his father Riveley John Michael Choyen. Joshua’s performance flowed out of love for his father and actively testified to the neighbouring community that we mourn  but not as others do  because like our brother John we have the blessed hope of life eternal. John will be sadly missed  but we know that Jesus is coming soon and we will see him again.      Just one week later Joshua and Caleb participated in an online concert “Songs of Hope” to raise money for their local NHS hospital (Croydon University Hospital) and the local foodbank. Their parents have instilled strong values of giving back to the community and these commitments were made before the tragedy struck. In spite of their own grief the boys faithfully participated in the concert dedicating their performance (clip provided below) to their beloved dad.    ",False

In the meantime the government intervened and the free school dinner row has made us realise that we need to be making food available now. While we still set up the shop we will be opening to distribute any food we can get. We hope in the next few weeks to use The Institute in Ottery St Mary as a proper community resource to make sure that no one in Ottery goes hungry.        It seems a lifetime ago that we first heard of Covid-19 but it is sometimes hard to believe it has only been a few short months. Back at the start of March a local Ottery St Mary resident floated an idea on social media. Her idea was to create a volunteer team to help the “at risk”  elderly  self-isolating and key workers in our community.     From that seed of an idea  in one week over 400 local residents signed up to join and selflessly come to the aid of those around them. Ottery Community Volunteers (OCV) became a reality. Now a unregistered Not for Profit organisation the group has already mobilised to provide vital support to the local community.     What is the purpose of the group?     OCV have three key objectives:     • To establish and sustain for an extended time  a volunteer force capable of supporting our community.     • To minimise the transmission and infection rates of Covid-19 by reducing the footfall within our community and supporting people in isolation.     • To maintain a robust and enduring volunteer operation for as long as is needed  resilient enough to support our community.     What are we actually doing for our community?     The volunteer network is already operational and working in our community. We have divided the volunteer network into priority areas:     Pharmacy Group – collecting and delivering prescriptions for the target people.     Deliveries Team – focused on doing shopping for food & essential supplies  delivered to homes for those self-isolating & vulnerable  reducing the footfall of people in town.     Befriending Group – working alongside the Ottery Help Scheme we offer befriending telephone support for those in need of someone to talk to during their isolation    Foodbank Team – Our volunteers also work with Ottery Foodbank  supporting their essential efforts.    Mental health wellbeing service to our volunteers  run by volunteer healthcare professionals.    Finance team - Using prepaid cards to minimise the use of cash and the risks for transmission of Covid-19  as well as ensuring robust financial accountability.    Why are we fund raising?     Whilst OCV has already started work  up until this point we have relied upon a great deal of good will from volunteers and businesses. In order for us to offer a safe  sustainable  efficient and professional service for our local community we need funding. We recognise that there will be a requirement for active community support for many months to come. We will be using the funds raised to cover a wide range of budgeted costs including:     • Safeguarding training including Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks for volunteers     • Insurance    • Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)     • Volunteer out of pockets expenses including mileage claims     • Stationery & consumables    • Software licences     • Printing and postage    • Staffing & resources    Thank you.",False

With the current situation we find ourselves in due to Covid-19  I have been inspired by the things we have seen our communities doing for each other. Within those communities  you have individuals who may shop  cook or even cut grass for people at risk or our key workers  but then you have pillars of the community such as the Greyfriars that do so much more. Not only do they help individuals with foodbanks as an example  but they are an important part of the Irish heritage and support the community in more ways than some realize. The Greyfriars has been the host to many an amazing night with some great memories with our friends and family. The team are like family to us all  and I know my late mum thought the world of that place and the people that run and drink there  and she always had a great judge of character. If my mum was here now  she would be doing anything she could to help the club and keep it open  she had such great time for that place and the people involved behind the scenes (obvious soft spot for Paul ) With the club being so important to our community  I want to help them as much as possible to allow them to continue to offer what they do for us all.

My name is Stan Intihar and I am a high school English teacher (and part-time illustrator) here in Edinburgh.    As the situation here (and around the world) worsens  the level of suffering for the patients AND the medical staff trying to help them will become increasingly obvious.    For years I have been involved in the Parent Council Cafes at the schools of both of our children and I have become *moderately* adept at baking scones (insert cheezy smile emoji).    Having 3 asthma sufferers in our family  we have received excellent care from the NHS over the years. Now I plan to show some thanks by setting up a wee ""Scone Stall"" at the exit of the Royal Infirmary at Little France. Upon the presentation of an i.d. badge  the holder will be entitled to a scone (plain  w/ butter  w/butter & jam and gluten-free  if there's enough demand). I will also be asking these staff members what kind of provisions/items would be helpful from a roadside stall. I hope the stall will then expand and develop so that we can show these people that we are behind them.    I will be in need of flour  butter  milk etc.    In addition  I am trying to raise awareness of the situation by designing a number of stickers which will be given away for free. As with the scones  I am only interested in covering my costs. This whole operation is NOT FOR PROFIT. If this is of interest  please check out my web site for updates:     www.stinkdesigns.com    And  depending on the response  I will donate any surplus funds to the Trussell Trust Foodbank.

My Dad  James Yule  recently turned 81 and  being on housebound lockdown for 12 weeks  he decided to do Couch to 5k on the back garden path.    (When my friends heard about Major Tom’s 100 laps for NHS  they thought it was my Dad!) Why?  Someone  BP  from a group he’s on  posted on the group page that - even though James didn’t ask for it - BP wants to sponsor him to complete his challenge  and he offered a donation to a charity of James’s choice!    This gave James his altruistic idea - That if people would like to encourage him to do it  by way of sponsorship  and other people can benefit from what he’s doing  then why would he get in the way of such generosity?!    As food and basic health needs are so fundamental/crucial for the people in the world who are most struggling  he would like the raised monies to go to the local food bank and/or care needs in the community.  St. Andrews Foodbank says:    “Those we serve may have lost their job  had a family split up  be victims of domestic violence  or had benefits delayed or suspended. In desperate times we are able to meet their immediate need for food.”  May we extend our human kindness to them.    How?  So  to make it easier for you to give  if you feel inclined  I’ve set up this page.    I will post updates between now and the end of May  by which he hopes to be able to complete a 5km run  actually running  for the half hour that the programme builds runners up to (and do the remainder by whichever means)!    What makes this a challenge  you might ask?   Doesn’t James do the Parkrun?    Indeed  James has done the Parkrun  before  and consistently since my Mum died  a year ago today  20th April.    He also has angina  a heart condition which makes running that bit more challenging for his body. So he will be doing it gradually/sustainably.    His mind/heart  whilst keeping it fit and agile - as well as desiring to support other people in the community to be well and healthy - is determined. How can you help?    With the challenge food banks face in receiving food from their usual sources (church congregations  supermarkets etc)  you giving money to this cause will ensure food banks are stocked  and people who need the support they offer can still access it.

Siem Reap Province - Cambodia    Siem Reap is a beautiful idyllic tourist town just a stone's throw away from the spectacular Angkor Wat Archeological Park in Cambodia.    ""If you have ever been to Siem Reap  or Cambodia in general  you will know how warm  friendly  kind and compassionate the Khmer people are"".    Since the lockdown began  hardly any tourists are visiting the city  with visitor numbers to the Angkor world heritage site down by 99.5%  only 650 people visited the Temple in the month of April  that's 20 people per day compared to around 5 000 back in January.    This situation has created a major problem in Siem Reap. The average wage in the city for people who worked within or in connection with the tourist industry is around $4 USD per day  that's less than $3.50p for around 10 hours work or 35 pence an hour.    The city is more or less totally deserted with literally no visitors  there is no money being spent  no income….nothing…zero. As you can imagine  if you were only earning $4 a day ""in normal circumstances""  then you can probably understand why many families really don’t have any ability to save money to help themselves get through the times when the going gets tough…really tough.     There are many reports of people hearing children crying themselves to sleep at night through hunger.     Many families are trying to live off the land by foraging for fruit and vegetables  frogs  snakes and Rats etc  but the basic essentials that we all take for granted in the UK such as Rice  Eggs  Cooking Oil  Salt and Sugar are products that thousands of families in Siem Reap simply can no longer afford.     Real Hunger exists  in Siem Reap Province  because a large number of families  living at or below the poverty line  do not have enough money to consistently put food on the table.    Job losses  due to Covid 19  have pushed the total number of hungry families to an estimated 20 000. That means as many as 80 000 souls in the Province  are going bed hungry tonight without knowing where there next meal will come from.    Why the Siem Reap Food Bank?    Having lived and experienced an amazing life in South East Asia for over 18 years  I wanted to contribute in a meaningful way  to help some of the most vulnerable people through the ongoing Covid 19 crisis.    After many discussions with my wonderful friend  Christopher Leonard who is currently living there and witnessing first-hand the stone cold reality of the situation  we decided together to spend considerable time researching and validating food giveaway programs currently operating in Siem Reap.    Christopher  spent quality time with Naret and Rick and we could both see that with more money  international awareness and resources  The Siem Reap Food Bank could reach out to so many more families in desperate need of support.    The Siem Reap Food Bank continues to make a real sustainable difference to people in risk of extreme poverty and hunger.     So I decided to volunteer my time to support this incredibly important project and I wanted to share with you why I have chosen this specific Food Bank.    The Siem Reap Food Bank initially launched in April to provide Essential Care Food Packages to people living with disabilities to help them survive the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.     The Siem Reap Food Bank support families headed by or including people with a disability  that have seen their livelihoods disappear  along with the tourists and shops  restaurants  hotels and businesses being shut down.    With the situation continuing to get worse it soon became clear that the Siem Reap Food Bank would not just need to support families with disabilities through this unprecedented time  but any families identified to be in urgent need of an Essential Care Food Package to help them survive.    How Your Kind Donation Helps These Families:    Below is one example of a family the Siem Reap Food Bank is helping every month with a £26 Essential Care Food Package:    Mai Lin  a single mom of 4 children  all under the age of 12  suffered a paralysing stroke about 5 years ago. At the time  she was overwrought with fear that she would no longer be able to take care of her babies.     However  she learned how to make shopping bags from old newspapers and the income generated was sufficient for her to support her family and was even enough to send her children to school. Mai Lin’s income dried up completely with the closure of the Genevieve’s Fair Trade Village shop that sold her products  at the onset of the CoVid19 shutdown.     Along with her first food drop  just before Khmer New Year (April 13th 2020)  came the promise of monthly food drops until she is able to get back to making a living for herself to ensure her family survives.      What's Contained in a Monthly Essential Care Food Package:      We only need 1 000 people from across world to donate as little as as £10 pounds (less than then the price of a few takeout coffees) to succeed in reaching our campaign goal to support 100 families.    Please  help us meet our funding goal by making any donation you can afford.     We know that this is very tough time for many  so if you are unable to donate funds can please help us by sharing this appeal in any way you can via ( social media  friends and family as well as any networks you have connections with) help us create awareness and momentum for this ongoing humanitarian crisis.    On behalf of the families you are helping  thank you for your kindness  you really are making a life changing difference.    Myself and Christopher are volunteering for the Siem Reap Food Bank  with Christopher managing the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event and I'm helping to create awareness for the gofundme campaign.     GoFundMe does not operate in Cambodia. Therefore  I started this campaign in the UK on their behalf with a Funding Goal to support 100 families that's 400 hundred people we can help and support over the next six months.     We project that at the very earliest tourists may return to visit Angkor Wat  in December 2020.

GoFundMe does not operate in Cambodia. Therefore  I started this campaign in the United Kingdom on their behalf to assist them to help an many families as they can.     I solemnly pledge that 100% of all funds raised through this campaign site are automatically transferred to my UK Bank account and then transferred directly into the Siem Reap Food bank ABA bank account in Cambodia.     HOW DONATIONS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED    Our goal is to make sure the Siem Reap Food bank has continuous cash flow to purchase food & other essential items throughout the coming months  therefore monies will be transferred to their bank account on a regular basis.     The Siem Reap Food Bank Use of Funds: To purchase and distribute essential food and health items for families in need of food support living throughout the Siem Reap province.    Essential costs: To pay for the products being purchased and supplied  plus a few dollars for delivery.

It’s not inevitable. And there is an alternative.    The story of the West Midlands is becoming like a ‘tale of two cities’. There are cranes in our skies. But our homeless neighbours are sleeping in the doorways beneath  where someone now dies every fortnight.    Our society feels like it’s ripping apart. Brexit has divided us. In its wake  hate crime and violent crime has surged. Communities no longer feel safe. Islamophobia and homophobia are spiralling while the far right goes on the march.    Meanwhile  our economy is failing a generation. Over half the people in poverty in the West Midlands are in work. Half our wards are in poverty. Youth unemployment is up by a 20% while apprenticeships have collapsed. For thousands of our young people  their possibilities in life are defined by the post-code where they’re born.

Reduction in food donations because of the change in shopping habits.    3. Self-isolation of some of our regular volunteers.    Our goal with your support is to ensure that no-one in the Rhondda goes hungry during this crisis.     For more information about the Rhondda Foodbank visit our website here.

Over 20 members of the Guildford City Swimming Club's Junior County A(&B) teams have come together to combine their shared passion for sport and fitness into a mission to travel 1889km between them over a five week period.    Why 1889km? GCSC was founded in 1889 so we thought it was a fitting target ... and a good challenge at an average of nearly 100km per person (or c. 2.5km a day).     We are all aged between 8-11 years old and will be supported by our families in our endeavour. Starting on May 25th  we will strive to cover the 1889km by any human-powered method we can - be it walking  running  cycling or even swimming if we can get access!     And we'd love to raise funds for the North Guildford Foodbank along the way. Supporting families in our local area who need a little extra help  particularly at this difficult time. It will certainly motivate us to know that we can help others at the same time as challenging ourselves  and to know that you are cheering us along as well.

Last night I sat and thought what if I could do something during my isolation to help my community from home. Me and my sisters spent some time thinking and we came up with the idea of ‘Cycling for Cans’.    During the next 12 days me and my two older sisters are going to attempt to cycle (on the exercise bike) all the way to London from our hometown of Blyth! For every mile we do at the end we will donate a can (or item) to Blyth Food Bank. So if we succeed and reach London that would be 296 miles.    Brandon really wants to join in to but he is too small for the bike he has been set his own little challenge while he takes over my litter picking and for every aluminium can he collects during his school run litter picks  1 can (or item) will be added to the total.    I will be sharing our journey with you and have made a window display which will keep us focused on our end goal as we will be cycling in front of it.

Wycombe Food Hub (WFH) came about at the start of lockdown. We collected residual food from leading supermarkets. Our products are often short dated and expired ‘Best Before End’ (BBE) dates. These products are still usable. The range varies on what we source each week from our partners. During the peak we were collecting over 200 green crates each week and supplying food to partner organisations who were using our produce in 100 meals a week plus 1000 food bags a week What we do We supply products to people unable to access or buy food  those that cannot get Government aid or are unable to survive on the Government’s benefit payments  those who are now suffering from loss of jobs and the self-employed who can’t get benefits  those who cannot access the traditional referral foodbanks. Also  Police referrals  refugees  pensioners  YMCA residents  homeless. The range of people coming to us for help is growing weekly. Considering what’s happening nationally the need for our food and services will continue to grow. Our growth We secured a small warehouse(room) and opened a market stall under the Guildhall in High Wycombe twice a week for 2 hours. We are now collecting over 300 green crates week and giving out 150 bags of food in 4 hours each week. In addition  supplying food to our partner organisations who are feeding in excess of 300 people a week. What is next We have now become a social enterprise CIC to allow us to formalise what we are doing. We have now secured a retail shop in the centre of High Wycombe. The shop will be open a minimum of 3 days a week. We have a warehouse in the store where we can sort and distribute food. This will allow us to both run the shop feeding those in need and also supply our partner organisations who need our fresh produce. We are now collecting from even more supermarkets  allotments and farms. More outlets are coming online in next few weeks. The shop allows us to distribute not only residual food but also offer chilled and frozen food. Partner organisations are now working with us and will be taking space in store to signpost and help those needing more care and referral to statutory authorities.

The current measures here mean that for many people it is impossible to work at the moment. Here there is not a support system in place to help people who cannot work or feed their families  or buy medicine.     We are deeply concerned for the welfare of the families that we work with  the children that we teach English to and the mothers that we spend Wednesday afternoons with in our women’s programme – as well as many other families that at the moment are in a really desperate position.     The lockdown has already lasted a month and the future is uncertain.     Huellas (Footprints)  the foundation we volunteer with are receiving donations and working with the city’s foodbank to deliver food parcels directly those most in need. Huellas have been operating for 10+ years and know the needs of the local area and families (a number of the volunteers live in the area too). They are so dedicated and the team’s response to the crisis has been amazing – finding innovative ways to educate the community to stop the spread of Covid-19 and providing food parcels.     Please help them continue supporting some of the most vulnerable families in the city and we can make sure that the children and mothers we work with  and the wider community  have food. If you have had the chance to visit Colombia  or know Colombians  you will know what warm  generous and kind-hearted people they are  and right now they really need some support.     We know that this is an incredibly difficult and uncertain time for everybody and that lots of people are already supporting charities that they care about. We are so lucky in the UK to have the NHS and a social welfare system that we can use. Many of these families have nothing and for most of us  the difficulties they are facing are unimaginable.

That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks  supported by The Trussell Trust  working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.    ABOUT OUR FOODBANK  An introduction to the Morecambe Bay Foodbank project.  Morecambe Bay Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. It began life at the GYM Church on Green Street in Morecambe and has now moved to The West End Community Centre on Westminster Road in Morecambe. We receive and distribute over six tonnes of food each month and our operation has been growing since its inception in 2012.     We have a small staff team led by our Foodbank Manager  Annette Smith  and over eighty regular volunteers who give up their time to help us each week.    ABOUT  HOW FOODBANKS WORK  Providing emergency food to people in crisis.  Every day people in the UK go hungry for reasons ranging from redundancy to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems.    FOOD IS DONATED  Schools  churches  businesses and individuals donate non-perishable  in-date food to a foodbank.

The Mayor of Peacehaven  Cllr. Claude Cheta has launched a campaign asking residents to donate either a tin or jar of food which will be delivered to the Seahaven Food Bank.  Cllr. Cheta has picked this charitable organisation to support whilst in post as Mayor.    Peacehaven Town Council are open for donations every weekday morning at Community House  Meridian Centre; however  we understand that the normal way of life has drastically changed over the past three months and it may be difficult to carry out a shopping trip to the supermarket. Bearing this in mind  we have also set up a GoFundMe so you can donate to the Mayor’s appeal without having to leave the house.    Either way it will help this vital cause. The Seahaven Foodbank covers the Havens which includes Peacehaven clients.    Seahaven Foodbank  also known as Newhaven Foodbank  provides food parcels to families and individuals in Newhaven  Sussex  and the surrounding areas.  The falloff in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that the food bank has had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one-week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries.  All donations to the Mayor’s GoFundMe page will go directly to the food bank.

So we all know that there are many families really struggling lately  and tragically kids are going hungry. There has been some amazing efforts to look after kids who usually get free school meals during the holidays but this has also highlighted that as a result of the events of this horrible year many families who don’t usually get free school meals are struggling too.     As a mum who listened to her babies crying to be fed and toddlers asking for constant snacks  and now my two teenage girls who seem to be able to empty my cupboards in no time at all  I cant imagine how it must feel to have to tell a hungry child that I have nothing for them- or to be a hungry child who  for whatever reason isn’t being cared for.     It occurred to me lately while I was writing my latest rant and sharing my angry memes on facebook that it was helping me feel better but not actually helping any hungry children so I’ve decided to have a very amateur attempt at doing a little something.     I’m hoping that by asking my lovely friends  patients and fellow business owners that there will be enough of us to make a tiny bit of a difference in addition to all the brilliant stuff that is happening in our community.     I don’t really have a plan or know what Im doing but if we can get as far as £250 then Satori Aesthetics will match it  and if we can go further then even better.     I was hoping to fundraise throughout November  because unfortunately it seems unlikely that circumstances will change before Christmas.    To avoid any debate over who deserves it more than anyone else I thought I would donate anything raised to local foodbanks who constantly provide food to anyone who might need it and to the Middlesbrough and Teesside Philanthropic Foundation who help local people all of the time.

We're funding this ourselves as much as we are able to  working in conjunction with many of our key suppliers  however lots of incredibly kind and generous customers  friends and neighbours have asked about contributing so that we can help even more people.    We've always been clear that we're not a charity  and we were reluctant to become involved with handling donations as it's so easy for good intentions to be misconstrued or misinterpreted where money is concerned. Having said that  we realise that there is only so much we can do with our own limited resources and the goodwill of our suppliers  so having taken some advice we've set up this GoFundMe page as a means to transparently collect any contributions which you wonderful people may like to make towards this initiative.    To keep things as transparent and open as possible  we've also opened an entirely separate  ring fenced bank account - and we will regularly share details of any contributions and expenditure both here and via our Dentons Deli and Newton Deli social media accounts.    As we've no idea what the cost of providing these meals will be until all bookings are confirmed  it's difficult to set a budget or to stop accepting contributions once the cost has been met  therefore again to keep things open and to ensure that nobody benefits unfairly from the generosity of others  we've decided to donate any surplus to St Helens Foodbank  and again we will share details of this publicly.    Thank you all so very much for your help and support. By working together  we can make such a difference to the lives of those locally who may otherwise be hungry this Christmas.           Please see below details of the campaign -     For many years we’ve not sent Christmas cards or gifts outside of our immediate family  instead giving a donation either of money or our time to charity  to help those in need.    This year  we’ve decided to try to do our bit in ensuring that nobody living locally has to go hungry. Whatever the reasons  and putting politics and judgement aside  far too many people - both adults and children - are going without the food they need to live  which is totally unacceptable when so many have far more than they need. We may not have a lot ourselves  but what little we have we’d like to share to hopefully make things a little easier for others.    So  The Deli Group are pleased to announce the launch of our “Nobody Should Be Hungry” campaign - www.nobodyshouldbehungry.co.uk    If you’re finding things a struggle  or you know somebody who is  we’d like to invite you to book a FREE Christmas Dinner  which will be freshly prepared and delivered on Monday 23rd December between 4pm and 8pm. All meals will be delivered hot and ready to eat  or can be safely kept and re-heated on Christmas Day.    Book online now at www.nobodyshouldbehungry.co.uk - we’re going to work with our suppliers to provide as many meals as we can  but places will be limited both by availability and the time it will take to prepare and deliver so many meals  therefore please book early to avoid disappointment.    Both adult and child sized portions are available  along with the option to collect from our Newton Deli shop or for the meals to be delivered to you at home.    No Questions  No Judgement.

"Help Jessica with the testing she needs","Charlton Kings, South West England, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/get-jessica-the-testing-she-needs,2615,-1,,2020-01-14,,,0,,"Overview In October 2019 I was diagnosed with two conditions of the cervical spine  cranio-cervical instability and atlantoaxial instability by a neurosurgeon who specialises in these conditions. There are only a handful of surgeons in the world who specialise in this field  with the only one in Europe based in Barcelona. This surgeon has diagnosed me remotely through taking a detailed clinical history and studying images from an upright MRI. Below  there is more information about what these conditions are and what they mean for me. The next step for me would be to follow the strong recommendations of the neurosurgeon and meet with him for a series of tests alongside a face-to-face consultation to determine the extent of the issue and how necessary/beneficial surgery would be. These tests are as follows: Cineradiology - Similar to a digital motion x-ray  this imaging is used to confirm the extent of instability in the spine. It is simply an x-ray in motion in flexion and extension of the spine. This is perhaps the most important test as the neurosurgeon suspects from my upright MRI that I have subaxial instability from C2-C4. Knowing the extent of my subaxial instability is important as it directly impacts treatment options  and this test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. MRV - The MRV is a angio/venogram (with contrast) of the brain and neck looking for possible stenosis or compression of any of the veins or arteries (especially the jugular veins). This is important as vascular stenosis can be a comorbidity or consequence of CCI and AAI  which I have been diagnosed with. If I have any compression  it may be able to be treated by a specialist here in the UK  which could alleviate symptoms - so it is important to know if I have it. Ophthalmologic exam - Similarly  the ophthalmologic evaluation checks for signs of papilledema or damage to the optical nerve from intracranial hypertension. Again  intracranial hypertension can be treated in the UK so this knowledge would be immensely useful for tackling my health moving forward. The results of these tests  and my original imaging and questionnaires would then be discussed in a face-to-face appointment. So far  I have been diagnosed by the neurosurgeon solely on the measurements of my MRI combined with my clinical history. A face-to-face appointment is important to confirm these diagnoses  discuss surgery and whether it is necessary  and ask any questions I might have. To this end  I am planning a trip to Barcelona in April and I have outlined a breakdown of the costs of the trip below: Cineradiology - €350 MRV - €700 Ophthalmologic exam - €220 Consultation - € 250 Total costs of tests and appointment - €1520  or approximately £1300. Additionally  we are also asking to partially crowdfund some of the costs of accommodation. The final accommodation isn’t booked yet but the cost is approximately £200 a night  with four nights total. Total costs of accommodation = £800 This means that we are asking for £2100 in total  with myself and my family paying for the remainder  including flights  the rest of the accommodation  transport  travel insurance  food  etc. Background information In 2011 I developed Myalgic Encephalomyelitis  a multi-systemic but primarily neuro-immune disease which has absolutely devastated my life. My health has declined a lot over the years; I had to give up schooling  became a wheelchair user in 2015  am unable to work  and now find myself bedbound/housebound a lot of the time. The symptoms are numerous and debilitating. I am in severe pain daily  my cognition is profoundly impacted  my muscles are significantly weakened  and my gastro-intestinal system is affected. I have developed co-morbid conditions  including a yet to be diagnosed heart condition. This is just a fraction of what I face. The crowdfunding campaign I did in 2015 to get my wheelchair absolutely changed my life for the better  and I would argue saved my life  given that I haven’t attempted suicide since I’ve had my wheelchair. I was able to take up archery  start several voluntary jobs which contribute a lot to society  become a lot more independent on a daily basis  travel the world  and save myself a lot of pain and speed of decline. However  my condition has still deteriorated  albeit a lot slower than it would have without my lifesaving wheelchair. For many years I had resigned myself to the fact that my disease is incurable  and in my case  progressive. However  in 2019 it progressed to be the worst it’s ever been and I lost a large amount of the little functionality I had left. This has left me in a dire place mentally  and at high risk of suicide. I started to do a lot more research into potential treatments and causes  most of which I had given up on years ago because of the prohibitive costs. I found that a small but growing subset of ME patients are finding that they have structural issues that cause symptoms similar to or the same as their ME symptoms. In October 2019 I found out that I am part of that subset  having both CCI and AAI as well as suspected subaxial instability. CCI in its most basic sense means that my head isn’t being properly supported by my neck  causing brainstem irritation and possible compression. As the brainstem is a vital component of a lot of bodily functions  this causes a whole host of symptoms  including tachycardia  heat intolerance  polydipsia  chronic fatigue  neck pain  facial pain  muscle weakness  dizziness and vertigo  and many others. AAI means that when I turn my head left or right  two of the uppermost vertebrae in my spine  the atlas and axis  are subluxing  which means a partial dislocation. As you can imagine  this causes many symptoms too. Whether the CCI is a cause or effect of my ME is unknown. It could be that the CCI is causing all of my ME symptoms  as in the case of Jen Brea and Jeffrey Wood (see below)  or it could be that the inflammation and tissue degradation that is part of my ME has caused the structural issues I am now facing due to my ligaments weakening. However  either way it needs to be addressed  and treating it could potentially improve some of my symptoms and give me more of a life. In order to treat it  we first need to know the extent of the problem  hence the testing. My life as is stands feels very unliveable. I am currently unable to partake in most of my voluntary jobs. I have had to give up archery  which was the sport I took up after having to give up cheerleading. I am slowly but surely losing everything that makes my life feel worthwhile. If I can regain at least some of my health  even to the level I was three years ago (still disabled)  that would be lifechanging  and saving. I am doing everything I can to make this happen  including private treatment for my ME in the UK. The CCI testing is a large and crucial part of the jigsaw. Unfortunately  none of this is available on the NHS. While the NICE guidelines are still under review  they currently promote CBT and GET as ‘treatments’ for ME  despite every ME expert in the world explicitly stating that this is harmful. I credit GET for the decline in my health that led to me becoming a wheelchair user. CBT is not an appropriate treatment for a neurological disease  though psychological support is crucial in dealing with such a devastating illness. I am receiving this mental health support on the NHS which I am immensely thankful for. Any treatment to address the underlying disease process and its effects (perhaps including the CCI) has to be done privately. I have briefly outlined below why I need help with this. If you would like to read more about CCI  please follow the links below: https://www.me-pedia.org/wiki/Craniocervical_instabilityhttps://centenoschultz.com/craniocervical-instability/https://medium.com/@jenbrea/health-update-3-my-me-is-in-remission-dd575e650f71 https://www.mechanicalbasis.org/ Why I need to crowdfund Due to the severity of my conditions I am unable to work and therefore my only income is disability benefits. A significant chunk of this contributes to my social care package which I use to employ a PA  and further money goes on monthly medical costs. So far I have been funding these investigations through money left to me by my Grandfather when he died  but this money is dwindling rapidly as I have spent a substantial amount of money on the Upright MRI and consultations alone. I need the rest for treatments in the UK  the cost of which is enormous. How your donation will help Any amount donated will help me get the testing I need to determine the extent of my CCI and AAI  which is the first step before I can undertake any treatments for it. Future treatments (which I will likely also have to crowdfund for) could give me my life back. What does that look like? It means me no longer being intensely suicidal every day. It means me being able to go back to my roles as a voluntary support worker for survivors of sexual violence; supporting some of the most vulnerable members of society at a local foodbank; and continuing my work as a local parish councillor. It also means me being able to get more involved with the activism that I am passionate about  and continue hobbies and passions that make my life feel enjoyable. If I am lucky enough to raise more than the amount I am aiming for initially  I will put this towards the cost of treatments  both for the CCI and ME  as these cost a significant amount of money and I am rapidly running out of resources  but desperately need the treatment.",False

School girls who are normally able to obtain free products from their schools  wont have access to these necessities. In addition  homeless women and other women in need may find it difficult to obtain them from foodbanks and shelters  where supply may run low. Our aim is to deliver free products to those in need during this period  from womens shelters  foodbanks  and to homes.

"Help poor, talented Cambodian students go to uni.","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/help-poor-talented-cambodian-students-go-to-uni,175,450,,2019-09-09,,,0,,"Help very poor but talented young Cambodians go to university and break the cycle of poverty.    (Meet the Um family  the first two candidates  Wataia standing in the middle in white  and Srey Vit standing next to me in black on the right)    My name is Jobi. I have been working in rural Cambodia since March 2017  first as a volunteer teaching English at a charity based in Takeo province  then as it General Manager  which included running it's education and community outreach through its Foodbank Project and other initiatives.     Now let me tell you about the Um family. They are very poor. Wataia is the young man in the white shirt and is 21. He had to start school late as the family couldn't afford to send him when he was younger. He is extremely humble and works tirelessly to provide for his family.    The young woman in black is Srey Vit  his younger sister who is 19. She managed to start school at the right age and that's why they have both finished high school at the same time  despite the 2 year age difference. She is very sweet  cares deeply for her parents  working very hard juggling studying  working on their farm and looking after their mother.    Both of them spend most of their free time helping make ends meet at the family home. They both love to study though and have a good record at school. Wataia dreams of working in a bank and Srey Vit would love to be an accountant as they are both very good at maths. They want nothing more than to go to university so they can get better jobs and help their family.    Their mother had stop working recently due to illness. She used to sell food and snacks before but even then the family struggled. Now the family is reliant upon the father  who is a labourer  but work is extremely sporadic and the auntie selling homegrown vegetable for $125 a month. At best  they make $275 a month. This is for a family of 5. Their is nothing left after paying expenses  especially as the mother is sick and needs lots of medical care.    Currently there is no way for them to attain their dream of going to uni. Their courses cost $600 each a year over 3 years. For a family of 5 that can barely get by $3300  $1200 a year plus all the other costs such as books and supplies is impossible to afford.     One thing that is striking is the high cost of higher education  with no government grant or loan system in place. It is a significant barrier to entry  and only middle class families can easily afford it; the poorer families have no way to access even if the student is very bright as only a tiny number can obtain scholarships.    Let me break it down:  University fees range from $450 to $650 per year depending on the course at the local university in Takeo. The costs to study at more prestigious university in Phnom are astronomically higher.     Most lower level salaries range from $80 to $200 a month. This includes working at one of the many textile factories  real 'sweatshops'  which are terribly regulated and unsafe. Often families are little more than subsistence farmers making little more than the bare minimum to survive  making far less money than those on salaries and their income is very unpredictable thanks to the increasingly varied weather during growing season thanks to Climate Change.    Virtually all higher paid jobs that are legal require a university degree as standard. If families cannot afford to have their kids go to university  the cycle of poverty for them is almost unbreakable in rural areas  even if the kids are extremely talented.     $1800 for a three year course is simply too high for the poorest to afford. They will likely earn enough to barely survive for the rest of their lives. However this is not the case  if their is outside intervention. This is what I'm asking you to be apart of. This fund will start providing talented but poor young women and men a means to go to university  break the cycle of poverty and improve the quality of life for themselves  their families and their communities. We intend to pay for their university fees either in full or partly depending on how much we raise.    We will pay the fees directly to the university ourselves. Each candidate will be vetted thoroughly and only chosen if they are deemed suitable. Everything will be invoiced and accounted for.    For Wataia and Srey Vit  if we can afford to pay at least half of their uni fees per semester of $600  they may have a shot at going. Even then they will have to make tough sacrifices. If we can raise enough to pay in full  it will be far easier for them  though still with many difficulties. Anything extra will go towards school supplies for them; textbooks are very expensive and a laptop to share would be necessary at some point for their course. Anything raised more than our target will go towards the next candidate for this fund.    This is one of the best ways to really change two lives in an incredibly positive way.     Thank you for taking the time to read this. I know it is a long read but I wanted to be as clear as possible. We have about a month to raise the funds.    Anything you could give would be greatly appreciated. Thank you and please feel free to get in touch.    Jobi",False

"Post Office Horizon Scandal","West Boldon, North East England, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/post-office-scandal,2305,50000,,2020-07-03,,,0,,"100% of future donations (since 14th July) now going direct to my 3 charities since the fundraising for Crowd Justice is complete.    I will be completing the C2C (Sea to Sea / Coast to Coast) cycle route from Whitehaven to Sunderland with a total distance of 136 miles within 3 days starting Wednesday 8th July to raise funds for the Post Office Horizon Scandal victims  described as the biggest miscarriage of justice in UK history destroying at least 1 000 lives. Amounts will also be donated to charities from the total raised. This will be a challenge for me as it is at least 5 years since I last sat on a bike  but for a cause like this it has to be done.        25% of the total pledges made will go to charities across the UK. It will be shared between NHS charities  Mental Health Charities and Foodbank Charities. Any amounts that exceed our total fundraising goal 100% will also be donated to the above charities. The amounts given to each charity will be shared once fundraising is complete.        I am looking to raise £50 000 (25% - £12 500 for charity) in total - again any amounts above the total needed 100% will go to the charities above) to get justice for Post Office Horizon Scandal victims whilst also supporting the charities that have helped these victims and millions of others during this pandemic. Lives destroyed  false imprisonment  bankruptcy & suicide. We have until July 15th to raise the funds needed so time is running out.    The Post Office Horizon scandal. The Post Office which is a government and public owned company has been proven in the High Court to be hiding information regarding the robustness of its IT equipment  treating its staff in 'capricious  arbitrary ways which would not be unfamiliar to a mid-Victorian factory Owner and then seeking to cover it up either with government help or through total incompetence. The government had a duty to get it resolved as mentioned in National Audit Office and Internal Cross Party government documents regarding ‘Arms length businesses’ controlled by government for which Post Office is one of them.    There are over 550 claimants who completed costly litigation  with around the same amount waiting in the wings (and probably a lot more). Lives were destroyed  businesses lost  homes repossessed  bankruptcies  false imprisonment  families destroyed  health issues and suicides  all down to a total cover up of the truth. It has since been revealed there are over 1 500 further cases.    I was one of these claimants and due to lack of government intervention for which they were responsible for doing we had to find third party funding to bring this to a head. This means under UK law the cost of funding cannot be recovered from the Post Office and it is estimated claimants will not even recover a tiny fraction of losses incurred. Those who made the decisions including directors  management and the chairman remain running this business. The EX CEO Paula Vennells who decided to resign days before the first substantial judgement was released by the High Court has since been awarded a CBE  a position in the cabinet office of government and also chairs one of the largest NHS Groups (Imperial NHS). The support of MP's is growing in recent weeks across both sides of the house.    We need an inquiry to ensure ALL those responsible are held to account and all those who suffered are compensated for losses that they had no control over due to a failing IT system   draconian unfair contracts and horrific actions by Post Office Ltd.    The Post Office continued to fight the litigation even though days before they responded to the claimants pre-court action letter they held a board meeting where they approved a document that stated their Horizon IT system was 'not fit for purpose'. They then proceeded to spend over 50 million pounds of taxpayer cash telling the court Horizon was definitely robust  this alone proves they were willing to cover up the truth. Here is an extract of the judgement handed down on the 16th December 2019 :-    “The IT Strategy  which is referred to in this Update Decision Paper  and outlined that “the IT [Horizon] was not fit for purpose” and which was approved in July 2016 by the Post Office Board is  in my judgment  entirely consistent with my conclusions on the evidence. It is not  however  consistent with the Post Office’s response to the claimants’ pre-action letter  or the Defence in the group litigation  or the evidence adduced by the Post Office in the Horizon Issues trial. The Post Office’s solicitors’ response to the pre-action letter is dated 28 July 2016  very lengthy  and states that “the investigations to date have consistently pointed towards human error or dishonest conduct in branches as the most likely cause of shortfalls.” [H 954]    All this was a complete lie and they were willing to allow Postmasters to lose their livelihoods  their families  some their dignity and others their lives whilst at the same time blowing through millions in taxpayer cash to do so.    We are calling on this government to start a full Judicial Inquiry led by Fraser Justice.    Your pledge will help us take our complaint to the Parliamentary Ombudsman for maladministration in the government departments (BEIS - Department for Business  Energy and Industrial Strategy) and the relevant ministers so those who have suffered enormously over a 20 year period can get the answers  accountability and justice they rightly deserve and finally move on with their lives. It will not bring back those who have sadly taken their lives but it will allow the family members left behind to have closure and justice.    I can tell you on behalf of all those affected who have waited 2 decades to clear their names will be eternally grateful for all contributions. There are some who are sadly no longer with us  others that have suffered life long physical and mental illnesses who are no longer able to fight....it is important we do this on their behalf.

He was also presented with a new list of medications which he cannot afford.    Can you help Winston?    Two years ago at the age of 65 my friend and Grammy Award Winning Producer  Winston was diagnosed with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) Stage 3  a debilitating respiratory illness which  while incurable  can be managed with medication. His condition was made worse by a botched treatment while in hospital where his right lung was accidentally punctured (and while he was conscious) drastically impacting on his already worsening health. To compound matters he returned to find his home had been burgled and emptied. His treatment to date has cost him any savings he had. He has also suffered a stroke.    As a result of his condition Winston cannot work to afford his already astronomical medicine costs. He needs the funds urgently  as without financial assistance this will not end well for him. He is based in Jamaica  where there is no NHS  no foodbanks and no Welfare State to fall back on  and health insurance which he now cannot afford  only covers 5% of any costs.     This is literally a life or death fundraiser.    Winston has to use several different inhalers just to be able to keep his laboured breathing going  which is currently being impacted further by the stress and worry of not knowing from one month to the next  and at this time from one day to the next  if he will be able to continue to pay for his medicine  travel to hospital and his doctor  a roof over his head and basic food.    Winston is an amazing and generous person  and has made a massive contribution to the global music scene starting out as Bob Marley's road manager in 1979 and going on to work as a producer and promoter with Peter Tosh  Max Romeo  Black Uhuru  Maxi Priest  Jimmy Cliff  The Wailers and The Heptones  to name but a few  in Jamaica  Europe and the United States bringing music to the world. He is generous to a fault and helped so many people both professionally and personally throughout his life. Now Winston urgently needs your help.    The cost of his medication and treatment in Jamaica is astronomical. Part of his daily medication is the use of SIX inhalers and just one of these alone costs US$250 (£192) per month. Each day that goes by being unable to afford his treatment  basic food and shelter worsens his condition to the point where it will be fatal.    Please help Winston today  without your generosity he won't make it.

Both charities have been affected by this pandemic and I want to help wherever possible.    Which two charities am I running for you may ask? This lockdown  I am running for Mind Buckinghamshire  throughout the current pandemic  many people have suffered from poor mental health and the isolation has intensified the loneliness that strugglers face day-to-day. Mind Buckinghamshire is a charity that is close to me as someone who suffers from mental health I have found running as a form of escapism throughout this and that it is why I am running in support of this charity.

Bauer media have taken over Rutland Radio and intend to turn it into a greatest hits station with no local information  events or travel news from the 1st September. From this date  you will no longer wake up with Rob Persani  it will be someone presenting from else where in the UK. Rutland and Stamford won’t get a mention. The content will be generic with presenters who’ve never heard of Rutland and Stamford. We need to save our station so we know what’s going on in this very unique part of the world.     Rutland Radio is part of our heritage. It has been here 21 years through blood sweat and tears. It is a labour of love and that’s what has kept it going all these years.  The current presenters do a great job and live in the local area. This means they can easily talk of local issues and events. They are ambassadors for Rutland and Stamford. Rob Persani presents Hero of the Week recognizing the great people in our community. They truly care about our community and are always helping charities such as For Rutland and Mindspace Stamford. Rob Persani cycled 40 miles for Ride & Stride helping to raise £20 000 for our churches’ upkeep. They helped raise awareness for Sonny Ferry from Ketton who tragically lost his life. They promoted the sunshine campaign for a new lifeboat. They really care about the people who live here. They promote the Grainstore’s breakfasts where people old and young can come together and talk about their RAF days. They are TRULY LOCAL with local content.  Rutland Radio is the glue to Oakham  Stamford and Uppingham. It keeps us informed of school closures  of flooding  of accidents. It’s a place to reminisce and feel included. It helps so many people. It promotes the foodbanks so those in need can get access  it promotes the Good and New Clothes Sale  which funds the Citizen’s Advice Bureau in Oakham  it promotes Second Helpings so we reduce our food waste and feed bellies instead  it promotes Mindspace Stamford so we can connect with our fellow human beings through art and reading classes. It supports our businesses encouraging people to shop local with shop Stamford and Oakham  Uppingham and Stamford Markets. They promote us with their Star Awards. They promote local talent including singers and bands such as Chloe Lorentzen from Stamford and The Tin Pigeons from Uppingham every Saturday afternoon. It keeps the elderly company when they feel alone.  The corona virus has been such a difficult time for us all and Rutland Radio have continued to keep us entertained and informed  with presenters working alone from home. Instead of being inundated with negativity about the virus  they have put a positive spin on it with poems from 8 year old Krystal Down from Stamford and chatting to For The Love of Scrubs Stamford  Lincs/Rutland.  So many of us have been isolated during this time and Rutland Radio have been a lifeline  a friend which has kept us going. The money needed will help pay for premises  transmitters  licenses and go towards salaries so we can help them get back on their feet.     How you can help:  1. Donate. It doesn’t have to be a large amount  anything will help.  2. Help me form a team so that I am not doing this alone.   3. Spread the word  by word of mouth or share on FB and Twitter  4.

Market Hill Fisheries are crowd funding to cover the cost of ingredients in order to provide FREE meals for children that need them the most.    The recent decision not to provide food vouchers for children is something we feel very strongly about. Since the announcement  we’ve seen other businesses around the country offer their support to those affected and we wanted to do the same.

In total you raised £2 215 (Q 22 747 Guatemalan Quetzales). Amazing!!!    It is time I reported back more fully on how your generous contributions are being spent.    So far  from this money  we have spent 8566 Quetzales (roughly £834) on medical examinations  care  medication and journeys. Details of these expenses can be seen below. During the process of working with the family  several issues have come to light  mostly the extreme poverty in which they have been living. Their home  which is made of sheets of corrugated iron  is very poorly constructed. It is covered in a sheet of plastic which offers insufficient protection from the weather  continually subjecting the house (and its contents) to damage from rain and flooding. The family also had no access to clean water  which has resulted in poor health  parasites and stomach infections. With regards to the operations we believed were necessary  it turns out that only Alex  the older boy  needs surgery. Alex has  however  chosen to wait until the pandemic lessens because the public hospitals continue to prioritise COVID-19 patients and it is deemed unsafe for non COVID patients. The surgery appears not to be as urgent as previously believed  so we will wait until there is more capacity in the hospitals to treat non-COVID patients. Alex will then decide if and when he will go through with the operation. It has been agreed that this surgery can be performed without cost. We  therefore  have £1 382 to aid the family in other ways. After much discussion with the family and careful consideration  we have decided to spend your donations as follows. I hope you will support the proposal:-    Asociación Vida will be supporting the family to make improvements to their home  in particular to the roof. The estimated cost for these improvements is £563. They will also install an electric water pump system to enable them to access clean water at the push of a button (cost: £205). Doña Felipa has  unfortunately  accrued some debts as a result of their struggle to survive  and are being hounded constantly to repay the debts. We have agreed to pay off their debts which amount to £390. To help the family to avoid the need for any loans in the future  we have offered to give them £146 in order to help the mother start up an embroidery business. We are also spending £78 on necessary medical attention. Asociación Vida are committed to supporting this family as they get back on their feet. As soon as Alex feels that he is happy to go ahead with the surgery  and if it is still deemed necessary  Asociación Vida will support him in journeys to the hospital and so on.

As well as running a medical centre  they work with some of the poorest communities to improve health  nutrition and living conditions. Patzún  where I lived has a lot of poverty and now  with the current pandemic  this situation has only worsened. As in the UK  people have been unwell or died from the virus and many people have found themselves unable to work - only in Guatemala there is no furlough scheme  no NHS  no foodbank and no benefits of any kind. If a household has absolutely no food  they are draping a white flag out of their home (or just holding it up in the street if they are homeless) and the village will do what they can to share their food.    Through friends of mine living in Patzún  I have recently been introduced to a widow  named Doña Filipa. She lives in a home made of corrugated iron with her three sons  Alex (17 years)  Edy (14) and Jonatan (11). The elder two boys used to help their mother with living costs by doing whatever work they could – manual work  selling ice-creams and so on. However  a month ago (on 6th May)  the sons were out collecting wood for their mother when they slipped and fell 25 metres down a ravine  resulting in one boy having a serious hip and rib injury and the other boy with broken legs. They are bed-ridden and both urgently need medical attention and operations. However  as there is no NHS in Guatemala  they would need to pay the hospital £2000 for this to take place  which is simply not possible.     We have already managed to raise some of this amount  but I wondered if  by sharing their story here  some of my lovely friends might be willing to contribute a small amount towards helping this family out. The money will be sent to Asociación Vida*  who will oversee any support we can offer this family – ideally enabling the sons to receive all the medical attention they need. Any help would be wonderful. If you want more detail about this  please message me – I just didn’t want to write too much on here. Thank you    *Asociación Vida is a registered charity  partnered by Tearfund UK.       Update: 3rd July 2020    I am so grateful to report that we have already raised over £500 towards this cause. Thank you so much for your generosity. The last few days have been spent taking the boys to the clinic in Patzún for some medical checks - and also to the hospital in Chimaltenango for X-rays and consultations with an orthopaedic specialist. The outcome of this visit is that Edy  the younger of the boys  needs an operation to correct the bones that have started to set in the wrong position since the accident took place two months ago. This operation is going to cost 20 000 Quetzales (about £2 085). The elder boy  Alex  will have an MRI scan on his back tomorrow (4th July) and from there a decision will be made about the treatment required. If you are in a position to give anything... we'd be so grateful. If you are not in a position to give financially  we would so value your prayers for these boys. Thank you so much xx      Update: 16th July    Thank you so much for your all your donations. We have all been blown away by your generosity :o)    We are still awaiting an appointment with the neuro specialist (re-scheduled for this Friday) to discuss the findings from Alex’s MRI scan. It is feared he may have serious spinal injuries  which could lead to paralysis. However  due to the COVID 19 outbreak  travelling to the capital for these appointments  amidst the government restrictions  is not proving to be easy at all.    If you are the praying type  please pray that nothing prevents this appointment with the specialist from taking place this Friday. Give thanks for all the money that has been donated and pray that it will be sufficient for both boys to receive the operations and treatment they need.    Thank you so much!      Update: 25th July    Thank you so much to everyone who has donated to this cause. Your generosity has been overwhelming.    Since my last update  the pandemic in Guatemala has worsened as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increase daily alongside the number of deaths caused by the virus. The Government’s very strict lockdown measures have also made it difficult for the boys to be taken to their hospital appointments in the capital  with police issuing fines to people who travel even for medical purposes. Nevertheless  both boys have finally received the results from their X-rays and MRI scans  which were able to take place thanks to your donations. Alex requires the most urgent surgery  as his spinal injuries could easily lead to paralysis. We await news from the hospital about when this can take place. Unfortunately  the Roosevelt hospital  where the procedure will happen  is rampant with COVID-19  with many members of staff and patients having died from the virus. This is obviously of great concern to the family  who  therefore remain somewhat nervous about their upcoming treatment.    If you are the praying type  please pray that the operations will take place soon – and for protection  healing and restoration for the whole family. Amazingly  we should have some surplus money from your donations  so Asociación Vida are making plans to offer further support to this family as well as to others who are also in great need. Please pray for wisdom for them as they seek to best meet the needs of their community at this very pressing time.    Matiox Chawe!

So instead of getting drunk on cheap wine and eating cake  I will play video games for 12 hours & raise money for two foundations that are near to my heart.     First up - Stand Against Racism & Inequality. For those who are unaware  my half-brother is black. We were adopted when we were younger  and out of our many siblings  the majority of them are black. Living in a small Illinois town they were an oddity  and racism did exist. Not a day goes by where my family & I do not worry about each other  but we worry more about the ones who can be murdered for just being black in a white world.     50% of the donations that are raised over the course of the fundraiser will be donated to Stand up Against Racism & Inequality.     You can learn more about the charity by visiting their website: https://www.sariweb.org.uk/who-we-are/about-sari/      This is not a Black Lives Matter only organization  but helps with all racism  bigotry  and sexism. But their focus is helping victims of hate crimes  and with those on the rise in the UK we can all agree that its a good cause.       The second foundation is Paddington Partnership: https://www.thisispaddington.com/paddington-partnership/about-us    They work with businesses in the Paddington area to raise money  donate their time and help out at some of the less fortunate areas of Paddington. This is interesting because our Building we work in is about 50 Million  but if I cross the street and walk 3 minutes  there's a crap block of flats full of people struggling. Paddington Partnership takes the privileged workers in these fancy offices & pairs them with programs and events to help those in need.     My team at work read with the students of King Solomon Academy every week  and have for nearly 3 years now. I personally run a monthly bookclub at the Marlybone Woman's shelter where we're currently reading David Sedaris.    On top of that  every year 3-4 groups get together to help in the community in various ways. Food banks  Soup Kitchens  putting a party on for Halloween or even gardening & cleaning the school grounds.     50% of the proceeds will be sent to Paddington Partnership to be split 3 ways between the following:    King Solomon Academy:https://kingsolomonacademy.org/about-us/welcome-2  The Marlybone Project: https://www.maryleboneproject.org.uk/  The North Paddington Foodbank: https://www.npfoodbank.org.uk/      If you are able to donate  I would appreciate it.

Throughout the Covid pandemic they helped so many families at the brink of despair. There are a worrying amount of children in our Borough who rely on their school dinners as their only hot meal for that day  that when the schools closed it was vital they had something in their cupboard to eat. And that's where the the PO9 Foodbank stepped up. Darren and his team selflessly and tirelessly put their time  energy  heart and soul in to making sure that no one and I mean NO ONE in our community goes hungry. The young  the elderly and the vulnerable are all supported. And I'm not just talking about it being for Covid  these guys do it every day  every week  every month  every year. They spend hours either talking or typing on their phones arranging donations  and taking requests and referrals for help. Then driving around collecting donations  taking them to storerooms  sorting through them  organising them  portioning them in to food parcels  (sometimes with very specific dietary needs) and finally delivering them to the front doors of those in need. The entire operation is run on Love  a whole lot of it  sweat  tears  less sleep than is healthy  stress  kindness  the most genuine heartfelt compassion I have ever seen in my life and of course  donations  whether they be in the form of food or money. Funding comes and goes  sadly. Unlike our daily need for food. And the PO9 Foodbank continues on  no matter what. So if you can  please support my chosen cause  while I ditch the bottle and give my liver a break  because these guys are awesome and need all the support they can get. ❤",False

Last year I was devastated to learn  how many children under 15 were living in poverty here in the UK and that many families were struggling to put food on the table let alone Christmas presents under the tree. knowing the Joy I felt running down the stairs on Christmas morning as a child I decided to create a gift giving initiative where were managed to raise 500+ gifts for children who may not have had anything to open otherwise. We then distributed these gifts with the help of Fareshare UK across their food banks in the South West.           This year however  it is clear that due to the devastating affects of COVID-19 many of our food banks are struggling and are worried about the up and coming winter months. I can not imagine families not having enough to eat during the coldest time of the year and therefore I have instead decided to set this page up in hopes of raising money to purchase food supplies.    We have a Van that has kindly been donated for the purpose of distributing supplies and a list of all the organisations we plan to donate them to will follow.    Your money will go directly to purchasing all these items. Foodbanks not only need food  but toiletries and every day house hold items such as washing up liquid.

Follow along on Instagram @indiabach    I had these two weeks booked off work to go on a romantic history tour of Italy with my husband it's something we do every year and we always look forward to it  we were starting in Venice and making our way to Naples over the two weeks.     As you can imagine that hasn't gone to plan and as I work in a shop rather than having my two weeks off I've found myself like all of us in lock down for atleast three weeks.     Struggling to find food on empty shelves and having the luxury of being able to grab the last that was left whilst making small essentials trips I couldn't help but think how terrifying this time must be for those who were already struggling to buy food. Now with children off school the pressure must be unbelievable.     I personally suffer with at times intense anxiety and depression so recently purchased an indoor exercise bike which during these times has been a live saver.     Challenging myself to add an extra kilometer each day to my morning cycle it suddenly hit me that in 6 days I had hit 76 kilometres and thought to myself this morning  ""what if I could ride the length of venice to naples."" that combined with feeling utterly useless in the fight again this virus  whilst so many are working day and night to help. I decided I would start a donation page to go along with my personal little cycle challenge. If the only person who donates is me then I really don't mind but I would be so grateful if you could spare even a £1 to go towards this amazing charity!!     So here it is 76 kilometres down  649 to go!       This is very thrown together last minute so bare with me but to be honest what hasn't been thrown together last minute recently!!

It is during this unprecedented time that we need to come together and do our share to help those impacted the most. We (Vik Mohith  Phil Tucker  Michael Brouder  Robert Palmer and Brian Macy) have decided to start this fundraising scheme on behalf of The Trussell Trust. As a result of the pandemic  families with little or no income  are falling behind and are struggling to provide themselves with the basics such as food. The Trussell Trust support a nationwide network of food banks and provide emergency food to those in need. Foodbank use has shown a steady increase over the last few years (Between April 2018 and March 2019  food banks in the Trussell Trust network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis  a 19% increase on the previous year) – the current pandemic will most likely increase the demand for these invaluable resources. We've come up with the idea of using a nomination system where we start with nominating 4 or more friends or colleagues to donate however much can be spared to the Trussell Trust. The nominees will each hopefully donate and/or nominate another 4 or more friends or colleagues who then do the same. This ripple effect will hopefully help us reach our goal. We absolutely appreciate that a donation may not be possible for everyone  but nominations will help spread the message of the good work the Trussell Trust do to those who may be able to help in a material way. Donations of food and essential non-food items such as toiletries and hygiene products can also be made at collection points in supermarkets across the country.

For a number of reasons  Alice and Adam were both back in the UK as the Coronavirus pandemic was taking hold. Because of the pandemic  unfortunately Alice was made redundant from her job in travel and Adam has also found himself out of work. Despite both being unemployed  they have given up so much of their time to volunteer throughout the pandemic  managing their local mutual aid group and more recently helping out at a foodbank.    After a tough few months  Alice and Adam were ready to bring Mo over from Sri Lanka. They completed all the paperwork as required and arranged the logistics from the Sri Lankan end with the necessary contacts and organisations. On 3rd August  Mo started her long journey to her new home.    However  on arrival  it was found that the person sending Mo had not completed all the required paperwork which would have allowed Alice and Adam to take Mo home straight away.    Alice and Adam  who hadn't seen Mo for almost a year  were dealt a huge blow - Mo would have to be quarantined for four months. They would also have to pay a fine of £3400 for the error  which was not their fault  in addition to paying to put Mo in a cattery for the duration of her four-month quarantine. Their contact in Sri Lanka has refused to take any responsibility and pay the fine and is now ignoring their messages and emails.    Alice and Adam are devastated and we are devastated for them  and poor Mo. They have always worked so hard but have fallen on tough times as a result of the pandemic  as many others have. Living in London with no income and a huge fine to pay for a mistake they didn't make is causing our friends a huge amount of stress. A cuddle with Mo would make things a whole lot better  but they have a while to wait until she is home with them.    They would never ask for help like this but we wanted to do something for Alice and Adam who are always so willing do whatever they can for others. We know times are tough for so many people  but if you can  please help our friends to get little Mo home.",False

As a result  the foodbank has become a valuable resource for families on the North and East sides of Acomb. This is one of a network of community foodbanks set up across the city who are all working together to share resources best they can.    The onset of winter means that to continue premises need to found as running this outside with no cover will no longer be viable. Premises have been found at a local church with the offer of a peppercorn rent. In addition to rent funding will be required to cover rent and fuel costs    The foodbank currently receives a significant amount of food donations from Co-op  Fareshare and Morrisons amongst others which is mainly of items such as bread and non-perishable items. Whilst the support has been amazing  this rarely provides sufficient fresh items to support the need  hence the additional purchase of such items mentioned above. Clearly such nutritional items are required for an individual to have a balanced diet  made more important by the fact that many children are supported by the bank.    Up to date the £250pw for fresh items has been covered by a weekly £200pw purchase of produce by a local charity (Kitchen for Everyone York) with the additional made up by the small amount of monetary donations received at the foodbank. However  the current level of support from Kitchen for Everyone cannot be maintained and their support has dropped to £100pw due to a shortage of funding. This level of funding will be continued until the end of 2020.    The costs of powering the fridge freezers and fuel for collection has been borne by the individual running the bank  but this cannot be maintained.    Your help is requested to help continue the service that has been so invaluable for the local community  especially as there are concerns that demand is more likely to increase in the short term rather than decline.",False

From giving someone a home  to helping them to get the right mental health support  we support people at the moment of crisis and enable them to build a life beyond a crisis. We are supported by more than 460 volunteers across London who provide specialist skills such as art therapy  yoga  IT  gardening & cooking  as well as befriending & fundraising.    Lockdown has been challenging for everyone  but for those living with profound trauma  coronavirus has heightened fears and prolonged recovery. Children in Hestia’s refuges have been isolated from friends  school and any sense of normality after escaping abusive households. Unable to run around and play  they have been confined to their bedrooms for their safety. We fear this could result in a long-term impact on their mental health and education.     How you can help    That is why Hestia is launching the Summer Wellbeing Programme (a change on their usual Summer Play Scheme). We know these families will continue to need specialist support with their recovery through therapeutic support along with other essential items over the summer holidays such as activities and games.     Every donation made during Big Give will be doubled and go directly to Summer Wellbeing Programme to help these families build a life beyond crisis.     Blerta’s story (as told by Alex her advocate)    Blerta* is a survivor of modern slavery and has two young children. She relies on emergency food parcels from Hestia and foodbanks to support her family.     Blerta and her family live in shared accommodation with other asylum seekers. This has been increasingly difficult as one of her daughters struggles with health issues meaning they have been unable to leave the house. The family are feeling really isolated and low as they need to stay in their room. Blerta will wait for the other residents to leave the kitchen before she deep cleans and then prepares food for her family so she is not having any social contact with anyone else.    Berta’s favourite reflection from last summer is the trip to the zoo she was able to go on with her daughters through Hestia’s summer programme  it was the highlight of their summer. Her children were able to return to school in September with a story of their summer to share with the class. The summer programme not only funded the trip to the zoo but also enabled each family to take a keepsake family photo of the day home with them which Blerta explained to her case worker it was the first family photo they had ever had and she was so thankful for Hestia arranging this trip.",False

We started off supporting Food Banks with large quantities of food items which were about to go to waste  donated to us by a company. Since then we have formed alliances with organisations and churches and have continued the work of supporting Food Banks.    The need is so great that the queues at Food Banks seem to be ever growing  so we decided to make it our priority to encourage the setup of more Food Banks in local areas.     To this end  we have now embarked on opening a Food Bank in Leyton E10. This will serve as a Food Bank  Soup Kitchen and a Distribution Hub as we continue to work with other organisations and Food Banks to cater for those in need.     As a community  in one of the world's richest countries  food poverty should never happen. COVID-19 has left individuals unemployed  feeling isolated  vulnerable and  as a result  hungry. Many people are embarrassed to say they have nothing to eat and with a 2nd lockdown now in place  we have already started to notice a spike in the number of people accessing Food Bank services once again.     Currently  we receive free perishable items 4 times a week but we would like to raise funds for non perishable items: pasta  rice  tin foods etc. which we can give to people in need for free. We are sure that you might have supported your local Food Bank in the past by donating items directly to them or putting extra items in the food trolleys at your local supermarket - this Gofundme initiative takes the hassle out of you purchasing the items and getting them to a Food Bank as we do the purchasing and if we are able to bulk purchase  then we will attract greater discounts from wholesalers which in turn means we can purchase and distribute more food items.     With Christmas coming up  no person or family should go hungry and we are asking for your support by making a donation to help us ensure that happens.

Millions of people and families in Britain have to make the horrible decision to either eat or stay clean because they are living in such dire poverty that they cannot afford to do both. We do not think that is fair  and so we are here to help.       Beauty Banks  which we established together in February 2019  distributes unused toiletries to registered charitable organisations throughout Britain who  in turn  distribute them to their clients who desperately need them. So far we have supplied hundreds of registered charities in the UK with hygiene parcels including Foodbanks  homeless shelters  refugees  NHS Trusts  Youth Centres  Community Trusts and refugee organisations.       We send the products most of us take for granted and can't imagine living our daily existence without like shampoo  deodorant  shower gel  soap  toothpaste and disposable razors. The products that make us clean and able to face the world. Not luxuries but essentials for our general health our mental health and our wellbeing.       So far - as we wait for our official charity status to be confirmed - Beauty Banks has been 100% self-funded. We've managed to reach thousands of people across the UK because of the incredible goodwill  kindness and generosity of our amazing supporters. We are and will remain homemade and grassroots because we want the few pennies we do raise and spend to go towards donations and delivery costs.       WE NEED YOUR HELP PLEASE.    The summer holidays are putting a massive strain on our charity partners as this is the worst time of year for Britain's poorest children. Official figures report that 3 million children who rely on the school not only for education but also for social engagement (friend-time)  pastoral care and a square meal the holidays are a hellish and lonely time. So they rely on our charity partners to support them and help them survive the summer.     For Beauty Banks this means we are overrun with requests for support and donations. We are fortunate that our amazing supporters continue to help us do what we do by generously sending us products week after week. The help we need at the moment is some funding to cover the costs of getting donations where they need to go. So if you can help by sparing a few pounds we would be SO GRATEFUL.

We will also be taught about the Borneo Fig Project which is a Rhino reserve.     During our trip we will be visiting the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre. This is a rehabilitation centre for these tiny bears as their populations are under threat due to deforestation and hunting for Chinese medicine. We will be learning about their natural environment and what the centre is doing to boost populations in the wild.     We will also be visiting a rainforest discovery centre. Here we will be going on trails through the forest  including canopy walks. We will be learning about this hugely important ecosystem.     We will be able to observe and immerse ourselves in the Kinabatangan community  while learning to make boats  fish traps and many more things!     The most exciting part of the trip for me is the Jungle trek where we will begin learning bush skills and jungle survival techniques. We will be fire lighting and setting up hammocks to sleep in!         Covid 19 however  has deterred our Borneo groups from making money easily. Therefore  we have tried to think of ideas that are within the legal boundaries during this time  which has led us to the conclusion of exercise! Lots and lots of exercise! We have opted for cycling.     Eight others in my Borneo group and I have decided to link our fundraising with the current situation and are going to cycle the distance from Wuhan to Malmesbury. (A total of 5575 Miles)  making that 620 miles each. We have set a target of September to complete this.     Individually we are collecting sponsorship for our efforts  if you are willing to contribute to my cause I have included my bank details below. I will update you periodically on my progress as I complete this challenge. I will also be donating 10% of the donations to the foodbank in Malmesbury to aid those that require a little extra help  during these difficult times specifically. Any donation  no matter how small would be gratefully received!     I also have an easyfundraising page where money is generated for my cause at no cost to you  simply by going through my link and buying what you normally would online (for example  Amazon  eBay  John Lewis  supermarkets and many more!)

Thank you in advance for your contribution to this gallant  local cause that means so much to so many.    ""We are truly delighted that the Speaker of Hackney has nominated us as his new Charity for the remainder of his Speakership. Now more than ever  we look to our community to support us in responding to the ever growing need among some of the most vulnerable people in Hackney. Whether it's through volunteering with us  donating food  donating money  or finding out more about the drivers of poverty  it all contributes towards essential support for vulnerable people in desperate situations  and helps shine a light on a situation that needs to change.     Prior to lockdown  Hackney Foodbank had observed a worrying trend in the growing demand for our services. The growth in demand was over 40% in 2018 versus 2017  and 52% in 2019 versus 2018. Truly worrying statistics.     But these previous levels of demand suddenly paled into insignificance when lockdown hit us earlier this year. In the first three months of lockdown alone  Hackney Foodbank served more people than we did in the entire year of 2018. That's over 5 600 mouths. Many of these people had been in paid work but were suddenly forced to stop overnight  with no safety net and no savings to tide them over. More than a quarter of the people relying on our emergency food parcels are children  and most of them are of primary school age.     Last year we fed over 8 300 people. In comparison  this year we have already fed over 13 300    We kept our centres open throughout the borough during lockdown  adapting to an at-the-door service so that we kept everyone as safe as possible in the face of the threat to safety posed by Covid 19. We will carry on serving people in need  giving them hope to carry on  and signposting them to other much-needed sources of support to help them out of the poverty trap.     We also continue our campaigning work  supported by the Trussell Trust  by gathering data and developing insights into the extent of poverty  and what can change to help tackle this growing issue.     We welcome the generous support we have seen from our community  and as we brace ourselves for a tough winter  with even more economic hardship on the way  we encourage as many people who are in a position to support us to do so. More information can be found on our website: https://hackney.foodbank.org.uk/    On behalf of Hackney Foodbank  a heartfelt thank you.""",False

I can't emphasise enough how grateful we are that dad is receiving all the support he needs which allows him to be financially  physically and mentally safe and secure  I would love to see everyone as fortunate as dad.    So  I saw this video on the news earlier today and it hit me so hard that someone like Kenny  who needs to be well looked after in a hospital or care home  (as he recently had his left leg Amputated  has Type-1 Diabetes  is at high risk of COVID-19)  is firstly  removed from the hospital care he was receiving due to the Coronavirus crisis demanding more beds (which is not fair but it is just that the priority is given to those who are struggling to breathe  of course)  secondly  he is travelling about 2 hours  in his wheelchair  all alone  to get the bare minimum amount of food to be able to survive.    Why? Because his disability benefits haven't started yet  because he can't stay stuck at home and wait for someone to get him food because there is no one to help him  because he doesn't have the money to go to a grocery store nearby  so he goes through all this struggle to get food that he doesn't even feel is enough for a person to be satisfied with fully but it is better than nothing at all and so he is grateful that this service is available for people who are struggling financially.    https://news.sky.com/video/coronavirus-amputee-forced-to-travel-two-hours-for-food-11974808    I understand that many of you may be going through your own problems due to this crisis such as being unemployed and possibly struggling financially yourself  or being a key worker and having to deal with added pressure at work or you may be a vulnerable person yourself. I do not intend to make you feel guilty for being unhappy about your own issues at this time  our own problems are the biggest hurdles for us and cannot to compared to those of others  it cannot be weighed against Kenny's or anyone else's  I completely understand that.    I  however  am very fortunate to be living at home with parents and not having to worry about money  food and shelter. Due to this privilege  I have decided to do something worthwhile for others who aren't nearly as fortunate as I am and so I request you all to please take a look at the attached video and maybe do more research to see the facts for yourself and if you are not struggling financially  physically and/or mentally  then please do donate  whatever you can  to help the charitable organisation- The Trussell Trust and allow them to carry on doing the wonderful job they are persistently doing every day to help people like Kenny and many others with less or more severe hurdles.     I am personally donating to this charity myself as I am unable to leave the house right now to protect my dad  given his high risk of contracting the virus as he is a stroke patient  partially paralysed  with many other health conditions and a weakened immune system . Hence why I have decided to additionally start this fund-raising page because I cannot physically go out and volunteer to help charities like this carry on doing the crucial work that they are doing. Helping them with donations and spreading the message across is the most I can do at the moment and so  that is what I will do. Please do what you can do.    1. you can donate money through the link in this post and it will go directly to The Trussell Trust who will then allocate the money for many food banks throughout the UK : https://www.trusselltrust.org/what-we-do/how-foodbanks-work/    2. you can also join this campaign to help fast track the start date of Government funded Benefits such as Universal Credit  for everyone who desperately needs financial support so that they no longer need to collect food from food banks and can afford to buy food for themselves. If you cannot donate money then please still join this campaign to be helping in some way : https://action.trusselltrust.org/help-create-future-without-food-banks    3. you can also donate food at your local food banks. I have found the link for you to find a food bank near you more easily so if you cannot donate money but are able to give some spare bits of food away then please do so : https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/find-a-foodbank/    4. if you are unable to do any of the above then please just pray in your own ways  to any power you believe in or even just send positive thoughts and well wishes for everyone suffering because of this crisis and irrespective of it.      * let us all help in any way or in every way that we can  the least we can do is try to have and give hope.

As I am sure you can imagine  this puzzled me somewhat. The church has no money  yet they have given me a £10. What's going on  I thought  and so I read on.    We have each been set the challenge of turning £10 into as much as we can to not only help the church but also the many good causes they get involved with. All money donated will  therefore  be divided 50% to the church  and 50% split between the free school meal initiative here in Selsey  driven by Chef Tom from Umble Pies plus the local foodbank.    I have started the ball rolling by doubling their money to £20. With your help  I am hoping to significantly increase this figure.    An interesting fact for you...    If just 5% of my LinkedIn followers donate £1 we would raise £220.    If that 5% also shared the link with their connections (assuming an average of 500 connections each) and 1% donated just £1 we would increase that amount to a huge £1 320!!

My name is Georgia - I'm a 19 year-old student from Wiltshire. For the past few years  I have fundraised for Trowbridge's local food bank  Storehouse. In 2017  my friends and school helped me raise £500 for the incredible charity which did a world of good for those who use the food bank to survive. The work our bank does is phenomenal  providing support to those in the community who need it most.     The Goal:  My plan is to raise £60. To some  it may not seem like a lot of money  but in terms of basic toiletries and other such necessities I have often felt I take for granted  such as washing up liquid  access to sanitary products and deodorants  £60 can provide tens and tens of hygiene items to those who need it most.     With the money I raise from my own donation (which I am submitting towards the project as soon as it is launched)  alongside any donations I kindly receive through this incentive  I will be taking a planned trip to my local Tesco store and completing my shopping list (below) for the food bank  then dropping it off with them directly. I'll do this in order for Storehouse to have these toiletries and items immediately to distribute.     Covid-19:  Now  more than ever  we must stand with our community. We recognise those in need and unashamedly support them when they make the brave decision to ask for support.     I have decided to focus this effort as a Hygiene Drive  due to the current coronavirus circumstances  as practices such as hand washing as more essential now more than ever.     Thank you so much for reading - I hope it has inspired you to be able to give back to those less fortunate when you are in the position to.

"Everest 4 Foodbanks! 15 hrs, 8500m climb, one ride","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/lukejelleyman,40,300,,2020-05-23,"The Trussell Trust","Registered nonprofitDonations eligible for Gift Aid.",0,,"  Greetings! I hope you're doing OK in these tough & uncertain times.     Today marks 2 months since lockdown measures were introduced in the UK. It's difficult to concisely describe the upheaval that's ensued in the wake  imparting job losses on many of the poorest low paid workers in our society. Despite lockdown putting an end to my own plans to go and coach tennis in Tamil Nadu  India for an eye-opening experience  my eyes are very much open to the far greater losses others have endured.    Thus  I had a think as to how I could help in my own way  in the covid-triggered absence of typical in-person volunteering that I love to fill my spare-time with; cycling was a no-brainer  given how much I love rolling on two wheels while promoting the mental & physical benefits of regular exercise.     However  I was also aware that  given how much time I spend on the bike  I needed to push the bounds a bit to make the activity more of a sacrifice than simply another training session; especially in light of the sacrifice our key workers are making every day in keeping the country ticking.    Henceforth  I arrived at the 300km target. Beyond the fact that it provides nice mathematical symmetry to an achievable fundraising goal for 1 week  it's over double of my usual biweekly training ride (135k). I'm undertaking it in my garden on the turbo in order to have a sustainable source of water & nutrition (especially given the covid-triggered closure of beloved cafes in my chilterns!). It'll likely take 11-12 hours to complete dependent on temperature  and will be by far & away my biggest ride to date! (Smashing the mountainous 170km I rode in the Dolomites last year!) I expect it to be quite painful after the 7 hour mark  and have been meticuklously been planning my playlist to distract from the intense quad-muscle fatigue.    Now onto the important bit; why I'm doing it? Foodbanks were already an issue of crisis in the UK before we entered this new world; between 2018 and 2019  the Trussell Trust delivered 1.6m emergency 3-day food parcels  a 19% increase on the previous year; more shockingly  annual use of the TT's services has risen 73% over 5-years  with children attributed to around a THIRD of the demand.    I've been very loud in recent times about the heightened importance of (safe) outdoor exercise right now  due to the power it holds in fighting depressive emotions and protecting our health (and subsequently  the pressured health service). But  there is no escaping the fact; if people cannot put food on the table  they cannot access these benefits; indeed  malnutrition takes more away from them than simply the ability to run 10k; 500k children arrive at school hungry each day  vastly limiting their potential to achieve highly and rise up the precarious social mobility ladder.    Thanks so much for reading this mini-essay; I hope it's struck a chord with you and provided a bitesized insight into the critical issue of food poverty today. It is saddening to contemplate  but the pandemic's dual attack on low-paid employment and public service provisions in the likely future austerity-era will only make the above figures worse. I'm aware of the awkwardness of asking for donations during such a financially-challenging time  but if you consider yourself privileged and would be able to make a contribution  I would be most grateful.      Luke xx    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE: Saturday 7th June     Hello! I hope you're all coping amidst the increasingly tragic situation displayed on the news globally. I hope this can provide a nice little positive respite and inspire more exercise fundraisers!    I've seen many of my cycling and adventure photographer heroes recently attempt the 'Everest' Challenge; this is fairly simple in nature  albeit momentous in the numbers. Basically  the aim is to climb the equivalent of Mt Everest (from sea level  not the prominence you geographic geeks) in one bike ride; this can either be done by repeating a single climb on the open road  or on a stationary turbo equipped to monitor power & gradients in a virtual course.     I'll be doing the latter for two reasons; firstly  there aren't really any long climbs in my end of the UK  and a short hill would mean thousands of reps and potentially more traffic collision risk; secondly  this is easily going to be the toughest physical challenge I've ever done! Thus  I'm going to need to have some respite in the form of accessible water and nutrition!    While the length of the ride will inevitably be shorter than 300k  averaging 100-120 from the attempts I've seen so far  the horrific gradient and 8 848m of climbing means it'll take in my estimation about 14-15hours; in addition  muscle fatigue will probably be much worse given the slower pedalling uphill vs fast flats  where motion helps to dissipate any lactic acid buildup and provide constant oxygen to my quads!    Why am I doing this abusrdity? Basically the same reasons as before multiplied 2-fold; I want to undergo some pain and sacrifice to honour the incredible work of all essential workers during this pandemic. It is a sad paradox that many of these will not be far off the food-banks this is all raising money for  given the under-inflation pay rises over the last couple of years against rising urban property prices.",False

I am married but when my husband found out I was pregnant to him  he left me. Therefore I am not receiving any financial help  maintenance or any support whatsoever. I have worked from the age of 14 and also worked all my life til recently. I would never normally ask anybody for any help let alone any financial assistance  but I’ve been left with lots of debt and bills to pay because of my soon to be ex-husband  as I am applying for a divorce. I have had no food and now had to use local free help from the foodbank just to eat. This is my first pregnancy and I got sudden diabetes for the duration of the pregnancy. I have always worked but have not been able to work since December 2019 due to a accident incurring a fractured foot and broken wrist and have also had hand surgery operation with another two operations to go. I’m now ready to give birth next week and need to find a way of bringing together funds  donations.
