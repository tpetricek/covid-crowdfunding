,,,1110522,"The Trussell Trust",False,2019-11-28,"<div></div><div dir=""auto"">This festive season we’re building on the successes of the previous two years and raising money for the Trussell Trust — a brilliant charity that helps thousands of people in the UK feed their families in times of crisis via foodbanks. Last year, the Trussell Trust network gave out over 1.6 million three-day emergency food supplies to people in need, that’s a 19% increase on the previous financial year.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">When we started raising money for the Trussell Trust in 2017, 13 million people were living below the poverty line. Two years on, this number has grown to 14 million. People are going hungry every day for a range of reasons, from benefit delays (due to a drastically underfunded switch to universal basic income) to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. This number is growing for a multitude of reasons but the responsibility lies in the same place each time. Our current government is failing us.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">Winter is always the busiest period for foodbanks, so we’d like your help to raise as much cash as possible. A tin of beans costs as little as 30p, so any donation you make however small or large will really help!</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">We wish that each year we wouldn't need to fundraise for this cause, it shouldn’t be down to the Trussell Trust (and many other similar organisations), there should be a system that supports and cares for people.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">Please share this on all of your social platforms to help us achieve our goal. Then, on December the 12th please vote for a change — the right are failing us all, but most importantly, they're failing those who are in need of a social care system that works.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">Thank you, we couldn’t do this without you!</div><div><br></div><div><div><div><div><font color=""#3a3a3a""></font></div></div></div></div>",74,74,"2020-10-25 15/2020-01-11 10/2019-12-24 15/2019-12-19 7/2019-12-19 10/2019-12-17 30/2019-12-16 10/2019-12-14 25/2019-12-14 20/2019-12-14 20/2019-12-14 20/2019-12-14 10/2019-12-13 20/2019-12-13 20/2019-12-12 10/2019-12-12 50/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 20/2019-12-11 10/2019-12-10 10/2019-12-10 50/2019-12-10 10/2019-12-10 20/2019-12-10 20/2019-12-10 30/2019-12-09 20/2019-12-09 20/2019-12-07 20/2019-12-07 10/2019-12-06 25/2019-12-05 10/2019-12-05 5/2019-12-05 20/2019-12-03 20/2019-12-03 20/2019-12-03 5/2019-12-03 20/2019-12-02 25/2019-12-02 10/2019-12-01 20/2019-12-01 10/2019-11-30 15/2019-11-29 25/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 40/2019-11-29 100/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 50/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 15/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-29 20/2019-11-28 15/2019-11-28 30/2019-11-28 10/2019-11-28 10/2019-11-28 50",https://www.justgiving.com/Foodbank2019,2020-10-25,1522,1500,"Festive Food Bank Fundraiser 2019"

Non-perishable food can be dropped off at Tonbridge Baptist Church 9.30am-4.30pm Monday to Friday.  However, the current need exceeds the supply of donated items.  This appeal will help us purchase additional food items when they are needed most.</span></p><p><span>We are concerned about the impact of the Coronavirus outbreak on those needing to use food banks and we are taking extra measures to ensure the most vulnerable in our community can still access food.</span></p><p></p><p>Each week SUSTAIN provides an average of 80 emergency food parcels. A family parcel costs £50 and an individual parcel costs £25 to put together, a total cost of between £2,000 - £2,500 each week.&nbsp; Your donation would go towards ensuring we can continue to provide emergency food during this difficult time.</p><p>All donations to SUSTAIN are ring fenced and restricted for the work of SUSTAIN.</p><p></p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Unfortunately, the Hackney Half Marathon event this Sunday was cancelled (even though we would have been able to maintain a government sanctioned two metre lead), but we didn't want to throw a good thing away. Now more than ever there are vulnerable people in society that need your help if you're able to give it, and we would be immensely appreciative if you could donate the cost of that pint that you haven't been able to buy this week. We are each donating £20. Details on the Trussell Trust are as follows:</p><p></p><p>More and more people are being forced to use food banks because they cannot afford the basics in life. Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year. Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure. They are working closely with their network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how they can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that they're able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.</p><p></p><p><span>It's times like these that you learn to give again.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>For a bonus - if we hit £200...</p><p>Andy <span>""I would only eat a scotch bonnet if you paid me £2000"" Donnan&nbsp;</span>will eat a whole habanero pepper (with milk)</p><p>Matt ""mushrooms are like slugs and make me gag"" Wright will eat three raw portobello mushrooms<br><br><span>Jack ""OoooO thats spicy"" Cundall will eat a whole brown onion raw</span><br></p>",37,37,"2020-05-19 10/2020-05-18 30/2020-05-17 10/2020-05-16 20/2020-05-15 50/2020-05-15 20/2020-05-15 15/2020-05-15 30/2020-05-15 10/2020-05-14 10/2020-05-14 20/2020-05-14 20/2020-05-14 10/2020-05-14 10/2020-05-14 20/2020-05-14 30/2020-05-14 30/2020-05-14 25/2020-05-14 10/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 20/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-13 20",https://www.justgiving.com/hackney-half-dwc,2020-05-19,620,200,"Half Marathon for Food Banks"

Every society should be able to feed its population. Systemic change needs to happen, and The Trussell Trust campaigns and fights to change policies and systems, but,</span></p><p><span>2. In the meantime, and while we fight for change, no family, and no child, should be hungry. Everyone should have access to the basics.</span></p><p>I am now asking my contacts to donate to this charity via this fundraising page, and I, in turn, promise to match every pound (up to £300) and use the money I match to buy food, toiletries and baby products and to donate them to foodbanks, refuges and/or homeless shelters.</p><p>This means: If you donate £20 to The Trussell Trust via this fundraising page, you will be contributing towards their fight to ensure people in the UK can buy the essentials, but, in addition, £20 worth of food/toiletries/baby supplies will be donated in your name. If you add gift aid, your £20 donation to the charity becomes a £45 donation towards ending food poverty!</p><p>Thank you so much for joining me in this - it's such an important cause, and, while we won't end food poverty, every donation and bag of food we put together will bring us one step closer to making organisations like The Trussell Trust obsolete one day (because food banks should not be needed in the 21st century).</p><p>Note: I will start matching donations from mid-November to mid-January. I will post pictures of the donations I purchase as a consequence of your generosity. Most food/toiletries/baby products donations will go to The Trussell Trust foodbanks, but I will also research women refuge's and homeless shelters who may benefit from this support also. Thank you all again!</p><p>Note #2: If (if only!) we reach £300, you can continue donating and the money will still go to The Trussell Trust, it just won't be matched, but don't let that discourage you from supporting this wonderful charity!</p>",28,28,"2020-11-14 2/2020-11-14 20/2020-11-14 20/2020-11-13 20/2020-11-07 10/2020-11-07 10/2020-11-04 50/2020-10-31 30/2020-10-31 35/2020-10-31 30/2020-10-27 20/2020-10-27 5/2020-10-25 5/2020-10-25 25/2020-10-25 25/2020-10-25 10/2020-10-25 20/2020-10-24 10/2020-10-23 15/2020-10-23 10/2020-10-23 20/2020-10-23 10",https://www.justgiving.com/amyfoodbanks,2020-11-14,652,700,"Amy's Winter Match Funding"

While I am fortunate enough to have a house over my head, and I can almost be a little choosy with what food I do buy, there are many people out there who were already suffering with lack of food access. And that was even before covid19 came along. Over 80% of donations to the Trussell Trust are from the community and with everyone in lockdown, and many people bulk buying, or online shopping, there are less donations.<br></p><p>So, I want to do something small to see if I can make a little difference. I am going to get my mum to cut my hair short and would appreciate donations from friends and family, which will go to Trussell Trust. <br></p><p>Why cut my hair and not something else? Well, I will also be supporting The Little Pricess Trust - my hair will be cut to meet their guideleines and I will store it until they are ready to accept donations. I have a lot of hair, and if I am going to do something to raise money whilst self distancing and isolating, why not do as much as I can?</p><p>If every friend I had on FB, LinkedIn and Instagram donated £1, then I would smash this target easily. Please only donate what you are comfortable with - be that a price of a can of beans or £10.&nbsp; It all adds up and will all help.

I have no idea how I will look and with everyone on lockdown, my mum will be my hairdresser (eek!). Doing it now also means that by the time I can see my husband (who is in isolation in the states whilst I am in the UK), maybe it won't look quite so bad...!

Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

To illustrate this, prior to the crisis our busiest week was in December 2019, where we supported 117 individuals and families across four foodbanks. &nbsp;In the last week of April 2020, just one of our seven foodbanks supported 126 individuals and families.

Normal people became extraordinary and developed heroic qualities. These short stories are of those real people, living a real life but in very unusual times when they suddenly found themselves faced with an unknown and invisible enemy.</p><p><span>Initially unsure, of how to continue with any normality but then finding an inspirational role for themselves. It is those people who became the inspiration for the me and the idea of the book originated. ‘Stirring Inspirational stories’ is sectioned into 2 parts.</span><br></p><p><span>The first part of the book is an anthology of short stories written during the days of the lockdown. I have written life stories of people that I was inspired by during this time. I feel that I did not need to search for them too far or wide. They were people around me : friends, neighbours, and family. These extraordinary people showed courage and selfless service, or they experimented and got creative in their kitchens or gardens.  These real-life stories will certainly inspire you as we face the realities of the new normal.</span><br></p><p><span>The second part of the book contains a range of recipes that were tried and tested in their kitchens during these times. I was compelled to include these mouth-watering dishes in this book. The recipes, consist of a fusion of contributors’ cultural experiences and varied cooking styles and ingredients.</span><br></p><p><span>Now sit back... read stories of real people, and be inspired. Do not forget to take a break. Bake a cake and try other fanciful recipes from the tried and tested list. I hope you will be absorbed in double consumption: where inspired compassion stirs culinary delights!</span><br></p><p><span>I've decided to dedicate all funds (Amazon have to charge for me to publish on their platform) raised for my eBook to The Trussell Trust. This is because during the lockdown,</span><span>&nbsp;food banks in this network provided more than 1.6 million emergency food parcels to people in crisis and they continue to provide this exceptional service . More than half a million of these went to children. It’s not right that people can’t afford the basics. With each free download of the book, I am hoping you would kindly donate £10 to the trust so they can continue with their mission of feeding people.</span><br></p><p><span>With your help, we can end the need for food banks.

Last year we raised £500 for Jimmy's homeless shelter, so we hope we can top that! This year we are raising funds for the Cambridge City Foodbank again.&nbsp;<span>Winter can be very difficult for those in our communities who are struggling, and the holidays can exacerbate that. The Foodbank is seeded by the Trussell Trust and provides food, sanitary and household supplies, and meter cards for gas and electricity to people in need.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Food bank use is at an all-time high in the UK and your donations of food and money will go a long way. This winter, help people who are forced to decide to 'heat or eat', and bring some holiday comfort to people in need! Here's how you can help:</span></p><p>1. Donate food. If you are based in the Department of Archaeology, please take part in our food drive. There is a box in the coffee room for supplies and updated shopping lists alongside it.<br></p><p>2.

Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

I’m also what you’d call a social butterfly, so the two tend to go hand in hand.</span></p><p><span>During the current lockdown situation and the governments advice on social distancing I wanted to somehow document this on my one walk of the day, but also being productive. I'd like the opportunity to photograph you and your family from a safe distance, on your doorstep, pulling stupid faces at the windows, maybe doing cartwheels in the garden, what ever you're up for. And for just £5 you get a couple of photos to remind you of a time you're unlikely to ever forget and the Mid Cheshire Foodbank gets 100% of that fee. This isn't about work, more about keeping active and helping out. Thank you so much for your support and I hope to see you on my rounds. Much love to you all, Adam xx</span><br><span></span></p>",41,41,"2020-05-26 20/2020-05-25 25/2020-05-14 10/2020-05-13 5/2020-05-12 5/2020-05-12 21/2020-05-10 10/2020-05-10 5/2020-05-09 5/2020-05-09 5/2020-05-09 10/2020-05-09 10/2020-05-09 5/2020-05-09 20/2020-05-09 10/2020-05-09 6/2020-05-09 20/2020-05-09 10/2020-05-09 50/2020-05-08 5/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-08 10/2020-05-07 5/2020-05-07 5/2020-05-07 10/2020-05-07 10/2020-05-07 5/2020-05-07 10/2020-05-07 10/2020-05-07 10/2020-05-07 10/2020-05-07 25/2020-05-06 8/2020-05-06 10/2020-05-06 15",https://www.justgiving.com/Adam-Murphy-Weaverhamphotowalk,2020-05-26,465,300,"Weaverham residents photo shoot walk for mid Cheshire food bank"

More would be amazing though, and super helpful for a really important charity. I dunno, maybe I’ll dream up some stretch goal rewards or something if we break the target. Time and date of The Buzzening to be announced as and when/if the mark is hit. If it isn’t hit, well, we’ll see. And I say buzz rather than shave because I’m not pulling a razor across my bonce.

So I am not asking for your support for any kind of recognition of me doing something remotely difficult. Instead I am asking for support for something much more profound. Over the coming eight months of winter over 3000 people will come through the doors of First Base. Each and every one of them will be in the miserable position of finding themselves unable to buy food to eat. And we will all do our very best to make sure each and every person who comes to us will leave the building with a bag full of the kind of food I am about to live off for a few days.</p><p>But there is a problem. A pretty big problem. As I write these words we have enough funding in place to just about keep the doors open until the end of December. Then nothing. January nothing. February nothing. March nothing. Three long, cold winter months when hundreds and hundreds of people will need us to be there to provide emergency food.</p><p>Sadly this is a problem we are only too familiar with. Every frontline charity in Britain knows how it is to live on the edge of a funding cliff. It is hard and it is stressful. Our local community is utterly amazing when it comes to donating food. Last year we received over £40,000's worth. When I spend my three days eating emergency food I will be lucky enough to have a fresh loaf of bread donated by Greggs and a pack of ham donated by Brown Brothers. The list of our food donors is a long one and we feel honoured to be supported by so many.</p><p>However the bags of food that arrive every day will never pay our electric bill. Or the phone bill. Or the rent. Or wages. Or the detailed accounts we are legally and rightly obliged to produce for the charity regulator. Or fuel in the tank to deliver made up food parcels to the 20 collection points we bow have across the region.</p><p>These are the boring bills which cover the nuts and bolts of keeping the doors of any front line charity open. They are boring but unavoidable. And the money to cover these boring bills is our life blood. By hook or by crook we need to find £20,000 before the end of March to ensure our doors stay open. It won't be easy. Anything but. However it is a situation we are only too familiar with. We have faced down this kind of funding crisis many times over the last 13 years and we are confident of doing so again. Never once have we turned away a single person who has come to us for emergency food. Not once. We're all pretty proud of that record and we have no intention of allowing such a thing to happen in the coming winter.</p><p>So. How can you help? Well there are two options. Of course you can donate a few quid on this page and if you do so we will be hugely appreciative. Or maybe you might want to go a stage further and do exactly what I am doing - live off a First Base emergency food parcel for half a week and raise so cash either with a page like this one or by using more traditional sponsorship forms. So how would that work? Easy. You can call me on either 07770 443483 or 01387 279680 or you can e mail me at markglenmill@aol.com. I will then deliver you a three day food parcel and sponsorship forms should you need any. Tell you what. I'll throw in a full signed set of my back list of books as a thank you. Then it is a case of eating emergency food for three days and chasing in a few donations.&nbsp;</p><p>So that's that I guess. Please support us either by donating to this page or by starting up a page of your own. Maybe I will see you soon with a box of food and a bag of books!</p><p>All the best</p><p>Mark</p>",128,3,"2020-11-09 9/2020-03-31 20/2018-05-23 60",https://www.justgiving.com/MarkSimonFrankland,2020-11-09,12565,15000,"I'm raising cash to make sure the First Base food bank survives the winter"
,,,1140963,"FAST UK",False,2017-10-06,"<p>For the past three years FAST UK has helped to finance an emergency food bank for some of the poorest people and families living in the Rroma village called Apalina on the outskirts of Reghin. So far the charity has helped to feed over 200 families but we would love to help more!</p><p>After a past visit we were asked for some help by Pastor Attila Toth who informed us that many families within this village were trying to survive on just one or two small meals per week. In the summer months it is possible for families to survive on gleanings from locally grown crops but in winter with temperatures often dropping to as low as -32 degrees centigrade with snow on the floor this makes this way of living almost impossible.</p><p>With the money raised on this page as a charity we will send money to Attila so that he is able to purchase good basic food locally in Reghin. All of the food purchased will be given out to the most needy families according to the need.&nbsp;</p><p>On a recent visit this summer that I was on Attila told one of our trustees that the funds provided over the past few years have enabled people to have enough to eat through the harsh winters and in a few cases even prevent people from starving to death. After seeing the people living within the village in September 2017 and hearing many families stories, I feel very passionate about helping them and would love you to as well!</p><p>Currently the total we send to the food bank is £1500.00 per year but we would love to send more if possible so more people can be helped. The £1500.00 we give feeds approx 200 through the long winters which amounts to about £10 per person to see them through the whole winter period. This money not only enables people to eat but also to have a much easier time throughout the winter months as this is often the hardest time for families living in such a difficult environment and with so little.&nbsp;</p><p>Can you help some on eat well this winter for just £10?</p><p><font color=""#212121"">If you can help then that would be fantastic, remember&nbsp;no matter how much you can donate, every pound helps to feed a person for a day, week, month and winter.</font></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

The Sleepout will be back when regulations allow in 2021, but the Foundation are again linking up with the Good Shepherd to suggest fans take on a sleepout in their home environment to support the two charities in their efforts to reduce the effects of food poverty within the city. 

With last year raising over £50,000, we hope to raise vital funds to continue to tackle issues which result from the economic effects of the pandemic, including food poverty.

I recently signed up to volunteer for one of Urban Community Projects' initiatives, the Camden Mobile Food Bank, to deliver food donations to vulnerable families who live on local estates. I signed up for the initiative because of 2 major reasons:<br><br>1) More so than ever, this is a time when&nbsp;the recipients&nbsp;really need our help as many of them, be it the elderly or ill,&nbsp;are confined to their homes and are unable to collect the food parcels themselves. &nbsp;<br><br>2) I myself have been fortunate enough to be a recipient of other people's generosity of time and financial resources, and I know from firsthand experience that a small act of kindness has the power to make a significant difference to another individual's life.&nbsp;To the extent that I&nbsp;am able to, I would like to keep this 'cycle of generosity' alive. <br><br>I am appealing to you because alongside my volunteering to deliver food, I&nbsp;have created a page&nbsp;to help raise funds for <em>Urban Community Projects </em>so that the charity is able to continue carrying out essential services to vulnerable members of our community, at a time when it is most needed. If you are able to, I ask that you please donate through the&nbsp;<em>Just Giving&nbsp; </em>website to&nbsp;support <em>Urban Community Projects</em>. <br><br>I will match your donations by committing to&nbsp;doing as many food delivery trips as I can possibly squeeze in outside of my work hours. &nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance.<br>Sello </p>",57,57,"2020-07-10 30/2020-06-23 20/2020-06-17 20/2020-06-10 50/2020-06-09 50/2020-05-29 50/2020-05-18 50/2020-05-12 100/2020-05-07 30/2020-05-06 30/2020-05-04 50/2020-05-04 15/2020-05-04 50/2020-05-03 30/2020-05-01 100/2020-04-29 100/2020-04-25 50/2020-04-25 30/2020-04-21 20/2020-04-21 200/2020-04-21 30/2020-04-21 100/2020-04-21 100/2020-04-21 25/2020-04-20 20/2020-04-20 50/2020-04-19 30/2020-04-19 20/2020-04-17 50/2020-04-17 100/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 10/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 50/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 20/2020-04-16 50/2020-04-15 40/2020-04-15 20/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-15 50/2020-04-15 50/2020-04-15 20/2020-04-15 20",https://www.justgiving.com/Sello-Lekalakala,2020-07-10,5475,5000,"A Helping Hand "

Football related designs (I’m a proud Spurs supporter and I’m not slipping on that Banana skin!), in short go wild but be respectful of others that will have to look at my face once your design has been enacted.</p><p>3.

Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

Over the next 12 months, we will be undertaking 40 good deeds, big and small, to support our local community, other businesses and charities close to our hearts.&nbsp;</span></p><p>We're kicking off by walking, running, cycling and dancing 400 miles in 40 days to raise money for The Trussell Trust. This is not your usual sponsored walk/cycle/run because several members of the team are self isolating - we're going to be getting creative and completing our miles in all sorts of ways, including exercise bikes, step machines!&nbsp;</p><p>We've chosen to support The Trussell Trust for this because we want to support the vital service that they offer. More and more people are being forced to use food banks because they cannot afford the basics in life. Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year. Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure. The Trussell Trust are working closely with their network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how each food bank can be best supported in the coming months to make sure that they're able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.</p><p>Anything you can give to help this worthy cause will make a difference. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for being part of our 40 year journey and for helping us give back to communities across the UK. We hope you are staying safe and well.</p>",8,8,"2020-06-05 60/2020-05-21 30/2020-05-21 50/2020-05-21 10/2020-05-21 20/2020-05-04 30/2020-05-02 40/2020-05-01 20",https://www.justgiving.com/SG400for40,2020-06-05,260,400,"Smith Goodfellow's 400 for 40"

Whether it be financial loss, buisness impact, furlough, redundancy, job losses, illness, waiting for benefits, self employed. You name it, I've heard it. But now more than ever, I have never said so many times ""are you managing to buy food on a day to day basis"" and the answer being ""no"" then referring to food banks.This is a basic human right. All adults and children should have access to food. And it is NOTHING to be ashamed of. Under the new announcement regarding free school meals...There are too many people struggling at the moment. Please dont feel like you don't fit the ""criteria"" to use a food bank. If you don't have food. You fit. And we all have pride, but at a time like this there are too many adults, children and families going without. And that is not a world I want to live in.&nbsp;</p><p>On a personal note, despite not being directly impacted by covid 19. Unfortunately my partner will lose his job soon due to it. And therefore as a household. We will be impacted. I'm not sure if my wage will cover my family. But I simply cannot bare the thought of my child, anyone elses child, a friend or stranger going without. And these charities are there for a reason, to be used. Me and my partner have worked our entire lives. But that doesn't mean that we won't end up struggling to pay the gas bill and buy and milk next month. And be in the same queue for the food bank with you. People from all backgrounds will rely on these places to ensure as humans we are healthy and in good shape to beat covid.

,,,1110522,"The Trussell Trust",True,2020-05-22,"More and more people are being forced to use food banks because they cannot afford the basics in life. Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

This is a lifeline to poorer pensioners, but being neither taxed nor means tested, it also goes to many who do not need it. We wouldn’t describe ourselves as wealthy, but we don’t need the payment to enable us to heat our house through the winter months.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p>This year the question feels to us even more acute than usual. Over the past months many people, especially young people, have been losing their livelihoods because of the pandemic, whereas we have had a steady income and have experienced a reduction in our outgoings during lockdown. It feels wrong to be receiving this extra payment from the government whilst others in society are accruing debt and even facing destitution. This is why we thought that this year it would be good to turn our our winter fuel payment into food for those in real need.</p><p>The Trussell Trust has a Christian foundation and runs 1200 food banks in its national network. Last year, they provided more than 1.9 million emergency food parcels to people in crisis, and this is predicted to rise by 61% this winter.

The Club is aiming to raise the £220,000 needed to provide food vouchers and lift the burden on families at what should be a special time of year.<br><br>Club owner, Mark Stott said:<br><br>""This is a topic very close to my heart, growing up my mum relied on free school meals for both myself and my sister and it is devastating to think so many families will struggle over the Christmas period. I’d like to thank Marcus Rashford and everyone else who has campaigned and raised awareness on the subject. <br><br>We appreciate it’s been a difficult and uncertain time for lots of people this year but I’d like to call on all our fans and corporate sponsors, who find themselves in a more fortunate position to make a donation, anything they can afford, however large or small it all helps towards our goal of giving these families a Christmas to look forward to.""<br><br>Mark has personally donated £100,000 to the campaign and the Club hopes to raise the remainder through a combination of Club Shop sales, corporate sponsors and donations from fans.<br><br>The Club is partnering with local charity Sector 3 to distribute the proceeds. Sector 3 supports individuals, organisations and communities through a multi-faceted suite of support, training, guidance and funding opportunities, enabling organisations to deliver social action on local priorities.<br><br>If the government do a u-turn at any point during the campaign the money will be donated to Sector 3 and partners to support families in need within the Stockport area over
