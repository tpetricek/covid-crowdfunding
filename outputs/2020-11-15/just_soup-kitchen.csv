,,,1051770,"Soup Kitchen at the American International Church",False,2020-11-10,"Many of you have called, emailed or messaged to ask about how we are coping with COVID-19 and the impact it has had on our organisation. Firstly, let me say thank you for the outpouring of support we've received. It's always a heart-warming feeling to know that we have so many incredible supporters. 

Last week, in light of the Coronavirus, we made the difficult decision to offer a takeaway-only food service to guests rather than their usual sit-down meal. As most of you know, we take a huge amount of pride in the fact that we offer not just a warm meal to our guests, but also a safe and warm space off the streets for them for the hours they're with us. As we considered the health risks we decided that it would be prudent to only offer a takeaway food service for the foreseeable future.

Absolutely any donation will have a huge impact on our services. Thank you for helping us support the homeless, vulnerable, elderly and less fortunate in London!

This is just a small part of my project and I'm partially hoping that it will work as a form of non-traditional&nbsp;public art. Whilst brainstorming ideas for this project, I focused on Peterborough because I have lived here most of my life meaning I have a personal attachment to this specific Urban Environment. A big issue in most urban environments is homelessness because of the overpopulation of the area, meaning it is difficult to earn money and afford a roof over your head, let alone food to eat. This is a huge problem in Peterborough so I'm using this project to start a campaign and raise awareness. </p><p>I have started this fundraising page mainly to raise awareness about Peterborough Soup Kitchen. Upon researching them recently, I have found out that they provide food and drinks for 35 - 76 people A DAY.

Opening of the new center brought such hope and strength to myself and my family along with making new friends, a fabulous place, warm and welcoming. Fundraising has been a challenge this year with Covid so our Kitchen table day is a little different. Not able to create gatherings as usual around the table laden with cakes and treats, to help Maggies. I am asking for a small donation to help Maggies through this very hard time. The work they do is so brilliant. Let's get this going. Thankyou all so much for supporting me with my fundraiser.

As a team of young people and mothers this reality for so many young people finding themselves without a safe home environment, no roof over their heads and an uncertain future is absolutely heartbreaking which is why we want to help raise crucial funds for the End Youth Homelessness movement and help bring an end to this sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Every £100 raised from your donations for our Virtual Sleep Out could provide four night’s accommodation for a young person with no where else to go.
