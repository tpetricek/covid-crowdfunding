The explicit aim of this policy is to 'incentivize' unemployed people into work [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37873922]. It is ideologically motivated, responding to the myth that being on benefits is a lifestyle choice, and will disproportionately affect single mothers and larger families as a result [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/families-set-to-lose-100-a-week-under-chilling-new-benefit-cap-theresa-may-george-osborne-a7401681.html]. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, savings made from this measure are likely to be offset by emergency hardship payments made to those struggling to pay their rent [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/07/new-cap-on-benefit-payments-will-only-result-in-trivial-savings/].</p><p><span>My day of willingly foregoing food is nothing compared to the food insecurity and poverty that thousands of people are forced to undergo on a regular basis. The benefits cap will erode the physical and mental health of individuals and families, including those who are already suffering, and represents a shocking assault on human dignity. Clearly, food banks are not a whole solution to this issue. However, they can offer two powerful sustenances: food and hope.</span></p><p><span>If you decide not to donate to this page or are not able to at this time, please consider adding a couple of extra items to your weekly shop in future and donating them to your local food bank.

We’re raising money and awareness for Southwark Foodbank, a service that provides people with emergency food in times of crisis.</p><p>For six days, we’ll be eating exactly what we’d receive from a Foodbank and keeping track of our experiences. Our message is simple: at any point this could be the reality for any family. Many people, especially in London, are only ever one pay cheque away from needing the Foodbank. It’s difficult to save money in today’s financial climate, and a number of small life changes could leave someone without enough money to feed themselves and their family.</p><p><strong><b>Why Donate?</b></strong></p><p>Again, it’s simple. All the food Southwark Foodbank gives away is generously donated by the public – but they need money to run the service! Venue costs to store and organise large amounts of food, wages to pay a member of staff to make sure the service runs effectively, and a van to transport donations between different venues in the borough. It all adds up and Southwark Foodbank relies on your donations to keep providing its amazing service and help those in need!</p><p>Thanks so much for your contributions.</p><p></p>",31,0,,https://www.justgiving.com/thefoodbankfamily,,1010,1000,"Rebecca's The Foodbank Family"

S6 Foodbank are expecting the increased need to continue for the foreseeable future, as more people experience difficulty as a result of coronavirus and its wider consequences. I believe that nobody in Sheffield should have to face going hungry. 

A donation of £27 provides food and basic essentials for a family of three for three days. I am aiming to raise at least £40 to help S6 Foodbank reach their £40,000 target. Whatever I raise (up to that target) will be match-funded by the Government via the Love Your Neighbour partnership, meaning S6 Foodbank receives double the amount.

Local schools, businesses and faith groups have provided vital support to the foodbank, enabling us to give three days’ nutritionally balanced food and support to people in crisis.</p><p>Hamilton District Foodbank shares the concerns of other Trussell Trust foodbanks in Universal Credit rollout areas about the adverse side effects the new system can have on people. The 6+ week waiting period for a first payment can contribute to debt, mental health issues and rent arrears. The effects of these can last even after people receive their Universal Credit payments, as bills and debts pile up. Hamilton District Foodbank is working hard to stop local people affected going hungry but is troubled by the extra pressure this puts on food donation stocks and volunteers’ time and emotional welfare.</p><p>As well as providing emergency food, Hamilton District Foodbank provides essentials like washing powder, nappies and sanitary products to families who are struggling, as well as signposting them to other services in the local area. Many Trussell Trust foodbanks, including Hamilton District Foodbank, are partnering with other agencies to provide additional services such as welfare advice, budgeting help and debt support at the foodbank itself, helping people to break out of crisis.</p><p>Isobel Graham, Foodbank Manager of Hamilton District Foodbank said:</p><p>“It is deeply concerning that we are still seeing an increase in the number of three day emergency food supplies provided to local people in crisis in Hamilton District over the last year.</p><p>“Anybody could find themselves in need of the foodbank. Every week people are referred to us after being hit by something unavoidable – such as illness, a delay in a benefit payment or an unexpected bill – means food is simply unaffordable. It really is only with the community’s support that we’re able to provide vital emergency help when it matters most, and we hope that one day there will be no need for us in Hamilton District. But until that day comes, we will continue to offer the best possible service to help local people facing a crisis. Thank you so much to everyone in Hamilton District who already donates time, food and money to help local people. If you’re not already involved, we’d love to hear from you!”</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><br><br></p>",44,39,"2020-04-21 30/2020-04-20 5/2020-03-31 10/2020-03-25 2500/2020-03-24 50/2020-03-22 10/2020-03-22 20/2020-03-21 100/2020-03-21 10/2020-03-21 20/2020-03-21 40/2020-03-17 50/2020-03-17 20/2020-03-17 30/2020-03-17 100/2020-03-13 50/2019-12-24 100/2019-12-23 50/2019-12-20 30/2019-12-20 100/2019-12-15 40/2019-12-12 100/2019-12-10 30/2019-12-02 100/2019-11-29 10/2019-11-05 20/2019-11-05 30",https://www.justgiving.com/HAMILTONDISTRICTFOODBANK,2020-04-21,4260,130,"Hamilton District Foodbank"

This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank.

The fundamental idea of the business is to provide healthy affordable food in the takeaway market were the fundamentals of cooking, seasonality and wonderful flavours would be at the for front of everything we do. Transferring the the skills I have learnt and will continue to learn from the incredible chefs I work alongside at Le Manior. Chef Gary Jones told me during my interview at Le Manior that food has the power to create happiness and escape from the world we face, which I've been told from my incredible customers my food has been doing for them. Pursuing my dream of becoming a chef has for the last 18 months of my life has been integral to every life decision I have made and this in turn has given me such incredible happiness, friends and experiences which I'm truly grateful for.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>However, In a turn of events three weeks ago when the country entered lock down, I like so many other chefs had the daunting news that we were no longer were allowed to go into work. This lead to huge worries as I was working on a zero hour contract at Le Manior, the fear I was no longer going to have any stream of income over the next few months hit home hard. So after lengthy discussion with my parents &nbsp;in the car journey home from celebrating my mothers retirement at Le Manior. The decision was made to start cooking meals for local people in Compton Dando and the surrounding villages to raise some money to cover my essential bills. Over the last three weeks we have been incredibly busy, serving food on 16 of the 21 days of lockdown and selling over 400 meals out of two ovens and 5 burners stove. However, through the incredible generosity of Belmond and the team at Le Manior I have retained 100% of my wage which has meant this money I had been earning was no longer needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, Like everyone else I have been watching the news every day for updates on the corona virus crisis and one story stood out in particular and that was of the massive rise of need for food banks and the decrease in funding and donations.This lead to phoning up the local food bank in Keynsham (Trussel trust). The discovering news was worrying, they had seen a 1000% increase in people using their service at several collection points in Keynsham and the surrounding area. They had also seen a huge drop in food bank donations and money coming into support their service. Therefore, Dan&amp;I have decided to pledge £500 of the money Hafu has earned over the last three weeks towards the Trussel trust and helping those most vulnerable in society. &nbsp;</p><p>If you could donate anything on top of this, it would be hugely appreciated by those most in need.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay safe,</p><p>Dan&amp;Will&nbsp;</p>",34,34,"2020-06-14 30/2020-06-14 30/2020-04-29 10/2020-04-23 30/2020-04-20 30/2020-04-19 30/2020-04-19 30/2020-04-17 30/2020-04-17 44/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-14 30/2020-04-14 50/2020-04-14 20/2020-04-14 20/2020-04-13 100/2020-04-13 30/2020-04-13 20/2020-04-13 50/2020-04-13 20/2020-04-12 20/2020-04-12 10/2020-04-12 20/2020-04-12 10/2020-04-12 10/2020-04-12 500",https://www.justgiving.com/Hafu,2020-06-14,1464,1000,"Hafu foodbank fundraiser "

Without the assistance of people and businesses in Sheffield, S6 Foodbank wouldnt be able to continue to support their guests, launch new sites and tackle the ongoing food crisis in Sheffield which is being exacerbated by coronavirus.

S6 Foodbank are expecting the increased need to continue for the foreseeable future, as more people experience difficulty as a result of coronavirus and its wider consequences. I believe that nobody in Sheffield should have to face going hungry. 

A donation of £27 provides food and basic essentials for a family of three for three days. I am aiming to raise at least £40 to help S6 Foodbank reach their £40,000 target. Whatever I raise (up to that target) will be match-funded by the Government via the Love Your Neighbour partnership, meaning S6 Foodbank receives double the amount.

This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

S6 Foodbank are expecting the increased need to continue for the foreseeable future, as more people experience difficulty as a result of coronavirus and its wider consequences. I believe that nobody in Sheffield should have to face going hungry. 

A donation of £27 provides food and basic essentials for a family of three for three days. I am aiming to raise at least £40 to help S6 Foodbank reach their £40,000 target. Whatever I raise (up to that target) will be match-funded by the Government via the Love Your Neighbour partnership, meaning S6 Foodbank receives double the amount.

Since April and all through the lockdown, the Southwark Foodbank has been delivering food parcels instead of people collecting them from centres and more than ever are relying on the public's support to keep the services running for even more people. In April alone, foodbank usage went up by 400% in Southwark.

To keep supporters safe, the foodbank is encouraging donations of Funds For Food, instead of physical food donations. 

Help us support the Southwark Foodbank with a small donation to keep them going strong as we head into Autumn and celebrate Harvest, giving to those in our community who might be struggling to afford food even more than normal because of COVID-19.

,,,1110522,"The Trussell Trust",True,2020-04-10,"More and more people are being forced to use food banks because they cannot afford the basics in life. Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

The most vulnerable older people and families struggling have been hit the hardest in various way. <br><br>The demand on Luton Foodbank has increased as more individuals were furloughed or made redundant during the pandemic. The first week of lockdown was extremely difficult as schools were closed and children receiving free school meals were affected. Food parcels rocketed to over 450 parcels a week during lockdown. <br><br>The devastating effects of Covid-19 means that more families than ever before are using the services of the food bank. The last three months have resulted in a huge demand on stocks. This is not sustainable for the Foodbank, which relies on donations from the community in order serve those in need. Luton Foodbank is expecting a dramatic rise in the number of food parcels as the town struggles to deal with the economic impact of the pandemic. <br><br>Age Concern Luton have been supporting the most vulnerable and isolated older people in our town since lockdown. Older people and those in ill-health are at highest risk of contracting Coronavirus. The lockdown has resulted in many older people experiencing social isolation and loneliness. <br><br>The team of volunteers at Age Concern Luton have been providing essential services such as weekly food parcels, telephone befriending service, housekeeping, laundry, bill-paying, cleaning services as well as support with welfare and benefits to prevent further hardship. <br><br>Luton Lions Weekend of Running is in aid of Luton Foodbank and Age Concern Luton. Now, more than ever, both these local charities need our generous support to help families and older people facing such challenging circumstances in our town.<br><br>This virtual event will take place on Saturday 3rd (<span>10k and Half Marathon)&nbsp;</span>and Sunday 4th (Marathon) October 2020.<br><br>Your contribution will support services that help families in need and care for the most high risk and isolated older people in our town.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br></p>",37,37,"2020-10-17 20/2020-10-15 500/2020-10-14 50/2020-10-11 30/2020-10-07 50/2020-10-06 20/2020-10-05 20/2020-10-05 10/2020-10-04 30/2020-10-04 30/2020-10-04 50/2020-10-04 30/2020-10-04 20/2020-10-04 50/2020-10-04 20/2020-10-04 20/2020-10-04 30/2020-10-03 20/2020-10-03 30/2020-10-01 30/2020-09-28 10/2020-09-28 30/2020-09-22 50/2020-09-17 20/2020-09-13 10/2020-09-08 100/2020-09-08 50/2020-09-07 50/2020-09-07 50/2020-09-07 10/2020-09-07 50",https://www.justgiving.com/Lutonlions,2020-10-17,1620,1000,"Luton Lions Marathon for Luton Foodbank & Age Concern"

In my role at Metro Bank I have seen first hand the impact interruption and reductions in income can have on people's ability to put food on the table. The Black Country Food Bank have provided an invaluable lifeline for those in need at this time, and I wanted to do something to help.</p><p>At Metro Bank Merry Hill store as lockdown 1 began back in March, we collected donations for the food bank in our banking hall and had an incredible response from our customers. Right across the Black Country individuals and businesses have been so supportive of the Food Bank in terms of food donations, but this time round in lockdown 2 I have decided instead to set myself a personal challenge to raise some physical cash to support the administration and overheads incurred in the logistics of providing this vital service.</p><p>I've set a modest fundraising target which I'm hoping to exceed, and I'm also looking forward to the inevitable health and well-being benefits that training for and cycling 40 miles will bring.</p><p>40 miles may not sound like much. Keen amateur cyclists regularly smash 40 miles on road bikes on a Sunday morning. This challenge however will be completed on a much heavier mountain bike, along the winding, muddy, dark and at some points downright treacherous canal towpaths of the Black Country. I will be completing a loop from Metro Bank Merry Hill store, joining the canal at the delph locks and winding my way through Stourbridge, Kinver, Wombourne, Tettenhall and finally by road to Wolverhampton Metro Bank Store around lunch time. After some much needed sustenance and a quick photo opp, it will be back on the bike and back on the canal following the railway route through Coseley, Tipton and Dudley Port before making a sharp right towards Merry Hill and completing the loop.&nbsp; The final leg includes a spooky two mile ride through the infamous Netherton Canal Tunnel, not for the faint of heart, and with weary legs I'm hoping to be back at Merry Hill by night fall.&nbsp; This is very much a ""couch to..."" challenge for me, so any support both moral and financial will be much appreciated.</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

The circumstances surrounding a crisis are unique to every individual, so we partner with frontline care professionals, such as health visitors, social workers and other community-based support workers, who are able to identify and refer people facing hunger to the foodbank. As well as receiving nutritionally-balanced 3 day food parcels, people are welcomed with a cup of tea, listened to and signposted to agencies that are able to help resolve the underlying cause of the problem.

Just donating what you can AND also sharing this page can make a huge difference. I'll be living on £1/day for 6 days at the end of July.</p><p><span><b>Live Below The Line</b></span></p><p><span>Live below the line is a challenge from The Hunger Project. It is quite simply - live below the line for a given time period. Sometimes a day, sometimes 5.</span></p><p><span>The aim is to raise awareness of extreme poverty abroad, nationally and at home, and to raise funds.</span></p><p><span>The line is the world extreme poverty line, below which 1.2 billion people live. That's a mind boggling number. The line is £1 a day. £1 a day for food - all your food for one day.</span></p><p><span>Bringing closer to home: 13 million people live in poverty in the UK. 600,000 of those live in Greater Manchester - 1 in 4 people. 3.9 million children in the UK live in poverty. 91,000 of those are children - the majority have 1 or more parents in work.</span></p><p><span>These are the people that access foodbanks - over 1 million times in the past year. 1 million times when someone would go hungry instead.</span></p><p>They do this week in, week out, unrelentingly.</p><p><b>6 pounds, 6 days</b></p><p>As a result, I will live below the line for 6 days. That's the 5 days people normally do, with a day on top. I'll be doing this from Sunday 23rd July 2017 to Friday 28th July 2017.</p><p><b>Why Manchester Food Bank</b></p><p>It's on our doorstep. It's personal. 1 in 4 people in manchester are in poverty. No-one chooses poverty - poverty chooses them. Manchester Food Bank was seeded by the Trussel Trust, and supported by them as part of their national collective of foodbanks.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Why am I doing this?</b><br></p><p>I'm doing this because I think modern society should be able to exist without people living on the borders of starvation.  Many years ago I had to live on a similar budget to this, but I think things have become worse. I was lucky enough to be able to use education to lift myself out of that. Many people are not lucky enough to do that. In the absence of change, they need assistance.</p><p>I feel strongly that foodbanks should not need to exist, and that they are a failure of society. Until they're no longer needed, those using foodbanks need help.</p><p>Lastly, it's in essence to raise awareness and to try and do something positive that I couldn't do myself.</p><p><b>Why such a high target?</b></p><p>Because it matters. I've picked a figure that is achievable and would make a difference. Yes, it's a hard target, but if I get 1/2 way there I will have succeeded. Every level of support helps. Some baseline numbers: £10 buys a basket of food for an emergency food parcel, £25 buys a family 3 days of food. (£2/day is not luxury), £50 restocks supplies on the things the food back runs short of for 1 week</p><p>Which ever way you look at it, the target makes a difference.<br></p><ul><li>Helps 100 families over a difficult period. Just 100 families. On average 400 people.?</li><li>Or it helps 250 people in a period of emergency<br></li><li>Or it helps the foodbank for a whole year to not worry about things they run short of.</li></ul><p>No matter the actual amount raised though, it makes a difference.<br><br>Bear in mind:</p><ul><li>How much do you spend on entertainment a week / a month? Can you go without that once?</li><li>Rather than a take away, can you cook at home instead?<br></li><li>If you're contemplating a new gadget, can you wait a month and instead donate 1/12th the cost?</li><li>As little as £1 helps, that seems like a little, but it can /literally/ be a day's food for someone.<br></li></ul><p>You might not be in a position to help financially. I get that.</p><ul><li>If you can't give, please share this page, this helps. Each time you share this page, you increase the chances of another £10 towards the goal.</li><li>Failing that, please add foods to a collection point. It goes directly to helping the same foodbanks.</li></ul><p><b>Gift Aid</b><br><br>Please, PLEASE, please gift aid your donation if you can. It boosts the intake. it means that every £20 donated raises £25 for the charity - with the extra £5 coming from taxes you already pay - forcing the govt to do a tiny fraction of their part too.<br></p><div><b>Donate via text</b></div><div><b><br></b>You can also donate via mobile phone.

It’s<span>&nbsp;like a foodbank, but instead of food, it offers essential items like clothing, books, toys and baby equipment to parents in need, right across London. It’s frankly alarming that thousands of families need to rely on ‘hand me downs’ and the good will of other people to barely survive. This is just for essential items. I am saddened that in this day and age tiny babies and children under 5 are going without the most basic of items right here in London, items I completely took for granted when I was pregnant and during the early years of my children growing up.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Can you imagine trying to breastfeed your little one without any breast pads to pop in after? Or not having enough nappies? Imagine not being able to clothe your children appropriately. Imagine trying to entertain your smallest children without the most basic of toys or books?&nbsp;</span></p><p>This is where I think I can make a small difference. As part of my ongoing #asyouaremotherhood campaign across Instagram and Facebook, I'm celebrating and highlighting those of us (silent) women heroes, who everyday, do all we can to provide for our children and to be the best mothers we can be.</p><p>There is such a pressure for us mums to be perfect: we all strive for perfection everyday when the reality is, perfection doesn't exist.</p><p>We all worry, are anxious about whether we're doing the right thing for our unborn baby or the children we already have. We can look at others and think they're somehow doing it better than us, and feel like we've failed.</p><p>We must change our attitudes and change the way we treat ourselves.</p><p>That's why I'm giving away a limited number of mother and baby photoshoots to celebrate how amazing and unique we are as mothers, how we ARE doing all we can to help our children.&nbsp;</p><p>And that our best is good enough. We are good enough.</p><p>Through this project, I can ask pregnant women and mums to come into my studio, get a fabulous photoshoot to show how fabulous they are (just as they are without the need for fancy or OTT props) - and spread the word about self-love and acceptance.&nbsp;</p><p>And then in return all I'd ask is a contribution to Little Village.</p><p><span>This is my way to give back to some struggling families on my own doorstep? Little Village does just that; giving the gift of the most basic but essential things to babies and children who really need them.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>As their website says: “It takes a village to raise a child - this is especially true in London where we often feel alone as parents.</span></p><p><span>“L</span><span>ittle Village is a gift from one family to another, passed on with love.”</span><br></p><p><span>If I ask each of my photography clients to donate, say, just £20 to this cause, I would forgo my booking fee of usually £95. Clients could of course donate more if they wish or were able to, but I thought this would be an excellent start.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So if you're keen to book a Maternity or Baby photoshoot with me, I’ll direct you to this page where you can donate what you can and then we’ll see what happens. Things will snowball from there. Let’s do this together and be part of something hopeful to change the world we live in, right on our doorsteps.</span></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Fortunately, my accomplice for the day, Nick Green, had not and was making tea for a quick vigil on the back patio before we set out on the long tramp around Wivenhoe.<br>Although I had done some scouting for key breeding birds on territory, the cold, windy conditions would make it something of a lottery on the day – especially at dawn – as to whether the birds would betray their presence with any song.<br>The Tawny Owls we might have hoped to hear from the back patio drew a blank. The wind was such that we could not hear anything from the estuary as we sometimes can, so we set off at 04.55 for Ferry Marsh. High tide, for what it was worth (it wasn’t going to be e big one) was at around 07.30, so we simply walked around ferry marsh on the sea wall (it is still impassable due to flooding) without lingering. We picked up Sedge, Reed and Cettis warbler without any effort, plus Common &amp; Lesser Whitethroat in the dawn chorus. No Chiffchaffs were heard until we walked back through the woods after looping through them from Lower Lodge after the return journey from opposite the Hythe on the trail. Along the river, we predictably scored Greenshank, Nightingale (2 territorial males either side of the river at Hythe), Common Tern and the more common waders, but no Spotted Redshank or Ruff as we might have hoped. A male Sparrowhawk swooped past us near the Uni and Bullfinches were barely audible above the breeze at the level crossing. The otherwise time-saving scope from Lower Lodge to the lagoons was passed up, but at great distance it would have been nigh impossible to see the Green Sandpipers and other smaller waders from that distance. We had seen 3 Avocets on the estuary the previous day, so felt confident that we would connect more easily than a long-range scan. With just over 2 hours to walk to the Hythe and then Wivenhoe Woods en route to Alresford Creek for high tide, we moved quite quickly. No Nightingales were in song in Wivenhoe wood. In fact, very few birds were evident. There were a couple of Jays to keep the total ticking over but by now, the lack of bird song was slightly concerning. A Cuckoo did at least make itself heard from across the river.<br>Back on the trail after Wivenhoe Woods, we connected with House Martins around West Quay. The walk to the creek yielded only Whimbrel and Bar-tailed Godwit, so we arrived at the metal bench with 40 minutes to scan across to Geedon Marsh before our breakfast rendezvous with Mark Norrington. A brief stop at the barrier did not yield Grey Wagtail, as hoped.<br>The vigil and the walk along to the bottom of Ford Lane for bacon rolls and coffee, courtesy of Mark, moved the species total from 62 to 71. We darted back to the creek mouth watch point as the wader and wildfowl count to that point was paltry... It seemed evident that most, if not all the usual wintering wildfowl and waders had cleared out, such that, other than the plentiful Whimbrels, we did not add anywhere near the numbers at Alresford that we had hoped, with Golden, Grey and Ringed Plover, Knot, Avocet, Spotted Redshank and Common Sandpiper all absent, as well as Wigeon, Teal and Brent Goose – all of which we would have expected.<br>We felt that we were 15 species short of where we needed to be when we dragged ourselves away from the creek with 79 species to our name, with one Mediterranean Gull making itself heard above the breeze. At least Little Owl provided an easy hit at Plumptons farm; Buzzards and Marsh Harriers were showing regularly without any thermals to speak of, but there were no more exotic raptors or larger migrants to add. We would have another chance with a later (not very) high tide late in the day, but at this stage, a total of 100 looked very distant, if not impossible without a significant fall of passage migrants. The walk along Cutthroat Lane to Sunnymead &amp; Cockaynes was very quiet. Our remaining hopes of Treecreeper and Coal Tit would be at Cockaynes or Villa wood.<br>To our abject dismay, there was no Willow Warbler or Garden Warbler in song at Cockaynes. As the clock neared 1pm, I called Debbie to suggest she stays at home rather than deliver our lunch. Discretion became the better part and we managed to trek across Ballast Quay track to aarive back at home for an extended lunch break and a discussion on how we were even going to get over 90, let alone 100.<br>The biggest gaps in the list of hopefuls (if no longer probables) were of estuarine species, notable by their absence in the first tidal phase. Other incidental passerine species and their likely sites were well spread across the area. The other issue was that Nick had only just recovered from illness and we had already walked 12 miles on just a few hours sleep...<br>By the time we had eaten as many turkey sandwiches as we could, Nick had retired for a “lie down”. I thought that this would be effectively the end of his participation so togged up again and decided to head out to the creek, via the trail, to see if I could mop up some migrants and to get much luckier with estuarine species. Realistically, this was highly unlikely, but in the context of achieving the highest possible total, this was the obvious option. <br>To my amazement, as I neared the jetty, Nick called to say that he had woken after barely 30 minutes! We agreed to meet at the creek. By then, I had caught up with the pair of Grey Wagtails on the barrier having heard the male gently singing there from the jetty. The two birds showed briefly before I marched determinedly toward Nick.<br>Whilst there was nothing new on Barrier Marsh, I was tempted to stop briefly for a Nightingale that was very close to the path in an elevated position. I managed to zoom through a small opening to pick out the bird with the camera and stole quite a pleasing shot.<br>By the time I reached Nick at the bench, all threats of rain had gone and we enjoyed the next 90 minutes in mostly bright sunshine, doing our best to identify silhouetted images between us and Geedon saltings.<br>In this time, Nick did brilliantly to pick out a lone Brent Goose and I was able to lock on to a Great White Egret over the saltings. This put us on 82 for the day, but it was now obvious that the estuarine species had all but moved on. A flock of Dunlins were still in the creek, some of which were in almost full summer plumage, as were the Turnstones and 2 of the half dozen or so Bar-tailed Godwits to raise the spirits a little.<br>Had we stayed out for the rest of the day until dark, we might have added 2 or 3 more species, but there was no way we were going to get near 100, so we called it a day and declared our innings total at 82 species with 17 miles walked.<br>At the time of writing, we have raised £320 plus GiftAid. I will be doing other activities in a bid to raise this, including a bird finding schedule and making greeting cards with wildlife photos to benefit the Food Bank. <br><br><br><br><br></p><p><br></p>",15,15,"2019-04-28 10/2019-04-28 30/2019-04-27 30/2019-04-26 10/2019-04-26 10/2019-04-25 30/2019-04-25 20/2019-04-22 30/2019-04-12 50/2019-03-27 10/2019-03-19 20/2019-03-18 10/2019-03-18 20/2019-03-18 30",https://www.justgiving.com/Glyn-EvansWivBirds,2019-04-28,320,1000,"Glyn's Wivenhoe Bird Race"

The pandemic has taken away this vital supply line (a bi-weekly footfall loss of 50,000+).&nbsp;<br><br>So I wanted to try and raise the amount an average season ticket at Newcastle costs.</p><p>Follow our efforts on my Twitter (@Ketchell) Instagram (@Ketchfootball) and via the hashtag #TourDeStadeLDN</p><p>*UPDATE*</p><p>Awful weather on 11 June has meant we have been forced to postpone until the end of the month!

My mileage has crept up to approaching a half marathon, so&nbsp; I thought I'd push through to 13.1 miles and use it as an opportunity to try and raise some money for good causes.&nbsp;</p><p>Primarily I'm raising money for the local food bank so they can help people struggling during the incoming recession. I'll also donate an additional 50% of whatever I raise to Music Venues Trust, who are trying to stop grassroots music venues from closing. Across the UK, 35% of venues have closed after the last decade. With venues forced to close during the lockdown, and possibly some of the last businesses to re-open, there's a real risk that many more will close without our support in the coming months. Thanks!</p><p>As I'll be running on my own, I will only be competing against myself when I ran a half marathon a decade ago. If I don't beat Young Robin on the first go I will keep going until I do. In the interests of transparency, my previous time was 1 hour 44 minutes, which is incidentally faster than TV's Andrew Lincoln who ran the Cardiff Half the same year.</p>",22,22,"2020-07-01 10/2020-06-27 10/2020-06-26 10/2020-06-25 10/2020-06-11 20/2020-06-09 20/2020-06-05 10/2020-06-05 20/2020-06-05 15/2020-06-04 10/2020-06-04 20/2020-06-04 20/2020-06-03 10/2020-06-03 5/2020-06-03 20/2020-06-03 10/2020-06-03 20/2020-06-03 20/2020-06-03 25/2020-06-03 50/2020-06-03 10",https://www.justgiving.com/Robin-Wilkinson1,2020-07-01,370,150,"Robin's lockdown half marathon"

A Rainbow Walk is something that we can all take part in as a school community while following the social distancing rules. We want to encourage as many people as possible to go out for a Rainbow Walk (run/cycle) on Thursday 28th May. Our target is to get out for our walk for half an hour. We can dress in rainbow colours, create rainbow flags to wave, spot rainbow pictures in windows and tie rainbow ribbons to the school railings if you would normally pass the building on your walk or your own fence/ gate/ tree so that we can see where our walkers have been on our fundraising day.&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst doing this we need to make sure we are being safe and sticking to the current advice and rules. Everyone will complete their walk (run/cycle) with members of their own household at a time that suits them throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p>All the money raised will go to Kirkcaldy Foodbank. Many families in our community will be finding things difficult with job losses and lots of uncertainty. With many extra people accessing the Foodbank throughout the town, any money raised will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>So please join in with us and have some fun.

Without the assistance of people and businesses in Sheffield, S6 Foodbank wouldnt be able to continue to support their guests, launch new sites and tackle the ongoing food crisis in Sheffield which is being exacerbated by coronavirus.

S6 Foodbank are expecting the increased need to continue for the foreseeable future, as more people experience difficulty as a result of coronavirus and its wider consequences. I believe that nobody in Sheffield should have to face going hungry. 

A donation of £27 provides food and basic essentials for a family of three for three days. I am aiming to raise at least £40 to help S6 Foodbank reach their £40,000 target. Whatever I raise (up to that target) will be match-funded by the Government via the Love Your Neighbour partnership, meaning S6 Foodbank receives double the amount.

Thank you for sponsoring me, and a huge thank you too from Chris and the team ",11,11,"2020-11-02 20/2020-11-02 20/2020-11-02 20/2020-11-02 10/2020-11-02 20/2020-11-02 10/2020-11-02 10/2020-10-25 10/2020-10-24 10/2020-10-24 10/2020-10-23 25",https://www.justgiving.com/BigAlsBigStepchallenge,2020-11-02,165,200,"ALEXANDRA's Stepping out for S6"

,,,1110522,"The Trussell Trust",False,2016-01-23,"<p>Hello, Treasures!</p><p>This year, I've decided to give myself a tough challenge to raise money for a cause that is very dear to my heart. <b>I am going meat-free for a whole month for the Trussell Trust</b>,&nbsp;which runs foodbanks up and down the country providing desperate people with the means to feed their families in times of financial crisis.</p><p>Doesn't seem like much of a challenge to some people. But those of you who know me well know that <i><b>I love my meat</b></i><b>.</b> I eat meat <b>almost every day</b><b>.</b> It is always the focus of my evening meal and forms a large part of my diet. Pork, chicken, beef, lamb, even venison... <b>I love it all!</b></p><p>However, I've become increasingly aware of how much meat I eat and I've decided to<b> see if I can go without it</b>&nbsp;<span>for a whole month.&nbsp;</span><span>There are so many people in this country who cannot afford to buy fresh food for their families, which is why I want to use this opportunity to raise money for t</span><span>he Trussell Trust.</span><span>&nbsp; And <b>I</b> <b>need YOUR help to keep me in check!</b></span></p><p><span><b>As long as you donate any amount of money for me to do this, I know I cannot cheat or let myself slide at any point.&nbsp;</b></span></p><p>These are the conditions I have set myself for this challenge:</p><ul><li><b>No meat or poultry</b></li><li><b>No fish or seafood</b></li><li><b>No meat substitutes, e.g. Quorn, imitation soy products such as soy mince</b></li></ul><p>Just good old vegetables, pulses, carbohydrates and probably lots of cheese and eggs, too!&nbsp;</p><p>This is going to be hard for me but it's for such a worthy cause. <b>The UK's use of foodbanks has increased dramatically</b> over the past couple of years due to the government's cuts in welfare for the poorest in our society. <b>Children everywhere are struggling to eat </b>and this is why foodbanks need the money to help families survive hard times.&nbsp;</p><p><span><b>Between April and September 2015 alone,</b> Trussell Trust foodbanks across the UK gave<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>506,369</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>three day emergency food supplies to people in crisis compared to<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>492,641</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>in the same period last year. <b>185,218 of the three day supplies went to children.</b></span></p><p><b>So please give whatever you can afford.</b> By donating, you'll not only be helping me stick to my challenge, but you'll also be <b>ensuring that more families can be fed through the Trussell Trust.</b></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving – they’ll never sell them on or send unwanted emails. Once you donate, they’ll send your money directly to the charity. So it’s the most efficient way to donate – saving time and cutting costs for the charity.</p><p>I'll be posting updates on my progress, including photos of my homemade veggie meals, on Facebook and Twitter, and perhaps a few video diary entries just for your entertainment.</p><p>Thanks for reading, and, echoing what we always chanted at the end of charity assemblies at school,&nbsp;<b>please give generously!</b></p><p>Shiraz<br>Xxxxxx</p>",21,0,,https://www.justgiving.com/Shiraz-Engineer-goes-veggie,,350,250,"Shiraz's Meat-Free Month Challenge!"

This year I’d like to change that, and instead of receiving presents I’d like to give something back to a community that is now in need of help more than ever. </p><p>Having had a rather hedonistic time at uni (still embarrassed<br>about that time I ate a whole pasta bake for four in one sitting tbh), and in light of the political events of last week, I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting on my own relative privilege and the state of the world around me. You can’t really turn on the news, or go on social media without being reminded that the world is a Horrible Place, and there’s very little you can do about it. Bad people are in charge, everything is getting hotter, and I’m never going to reach 5’4”. It’s all very disheartening.</p><p>So if other people can’t make good things happen, I’m going<br>to try my very best to do it myself. During the pre-election madness, I saw numerous statistics on Twitter that really shocked me, and in particular quite a few on food bank usage in the UK. More people are using food banks than ever before, and this number has increased from the tens of thousands in 2010 to the millions this year. The reasons behind this increase can be disputed to no end, but I think regardless of political persuasion you can agree that they’re a<br>highly valuable resource for many. One that shouldn’t need to exist, but one that pretty much means life or death for those that need them.</p><p>For that reason I’d like to collect donations for the North<br>Bristol Foodbank this year, the foodbank that’s local to both myself and many of you that I know. There’s been a 54% increase in demand from North Bristol foodbank from April-Sept 2019, and as the winter draws in, the demand only increases. Christmas isn’t going to be the best time of year for many, and even if you can’t donate I hope you can keep them on your mind over the festive season. </p><p>I’ve created this page for any donations you’d like<br>to make! I would appreciate them much more than any Christmas/birthday presents (although if you’ve already bought them, I won’t say no…), and they’ll do much more good as well. Also, if you’re around to give me something in person, you have no excuse now <span>😊</span></p><p>Thanks!</p>",20,20,"2019-12-27 10/2019-12-27 15/2019-12-27 30/2019-12-26 20/2019-12-25 15/2019-12-24 50/2019-12-22 10/2019-12-20 5/2019-12-19 20/2019-12-19 20/2019-12-19 10/2019-12-19 5/2019-12-19 20/2019-12-19 20/2019-12-18 5/2019-12-18 10/2019-12-18 12/2019-12-18 3",https://www.justgiving.com/mee-mee-turns-19,2019-12-27,328,300,"Mee-Mee's Birthday"

Only two months ago we were living comfortably as a family of four with two full time working incomes, now we are relying on benefits and support from our family to get by. This has made me realise just how quickly things can turn and that so many just now don't have the option of any support. Food banks are so important for so many families not just during this pandemic but every single day. I would love to do some door step portraits for families to capture this unique time. If your family is like mine and sporting many lockdown home hair cuts (including the dogs) then lets capture these special memories forever.

Winter can be very difficult for those in our communities who are struggling, and the holidays can exacerbate that. The Food Bank is seeded by the Trussell Trust and provides food, sanitary and household supplies, and meter cards for gas and electricity to people in need. Food bank use is at an all-time high in the UK and your donations of food and money will go a long way.

People on low incomes because of zero-hours contracts and part-time work are also frequent clients...along with those suffering debt - often because of gas and electric bills.

This is Luke writing this but I know my brothers feel just as strong about the issue as I do.&nbsp;</p><p>We are raising money for the food bank here in leeds as with the current economic environment, due to the virus and unemployment they need support more than ever. We want to help everyone but we also want to help our local community and we came up with a way to do this and that is by riding our bikes form the bottom of Cornwall all the way to the tippy top of Scotland. We're planning on doing this (all being well) in a time frame of 10-12 days. I had this idea after I helped a good friend of mine run 100km in 24 hours and it inspired me and sparked something inside me to want to help and Scott and George also wanted to bring light to this problem. Food banks need peoples support now more than ever as more and more people live below the poverty line, if you can help&nbsp; that would be fantastic and I know would cheer up someone out there.&nbsp;<br><br><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LeedsSouthFood"">https://www.facebook.com/LeedsSouthFood</a><br><br></p>",107,107,"2020-10-15 10/2020-10-11 20/2020-10-09 10/2020-10-09 10/2020-10-08 5/2020-10-08 5/2020-10-08 5/2020-10-08 5/2020-10-08 10/2020-10-08 20/2020-10-08 10/2020-10-07 10/2020-10-07 100/2020-10-07 10/2020-10-07 10/2020-10-07 10/2020-10-07 5/2020-10-07 10/2020-10-07 20/2020-10-07 15/2020-10-07 39/2020-10-07 10/2020-10-07 24/2020-10-06 10/2020-10-05 20/2020-10-04 20/2020-10-04 40/2020-10-04 10/2020-10-03 5/2020-10-03 20/2020-10-03 20/2020-10-03 25/2020-10-02 5/2020-10-02 10/2020-10-02 20/2020-10-02 20/2020-10-02 10/2020-10-01 20/2020-10-01 20/2020-09-29 15/2020-09-29 30/2020-09-28 20/2020-09-28 20/2020-09-27 20/2020-09-27 10/2020-09-27 10/2020-09-27 13/2020-09-27 10/2020-09-27 20/2020-09-26 20/2020-09-26 10/2020-09-26 10/2020-09-25 30/2020-09-25 20/2020-09-25 20/2020-09-24 10/2020-09-24 75/2020-09-23 20/2020-09-21 10/2020-09-18 20/2020-09-18 20/2020-09-18 20/2020-09-17 10/2020-09-15 20/2020-09-06 20/2020-09-05 10/2020-09-04 10/2020-09-03 10/2020-09-03 20/2020-09-02 10/2020-09-02 10/2020-09-02 10/2020-09-01 15/2020-08-31 5/2020-08-31 10/2020-08-24 25/2020-08-13 30/2020-08-09 20/2020-08-04 20/2020-08-02 50/2020-07-30 20/2020-07-17 10/2020-07-17 20/2020-07-14 10/2020-07-12 20/2020-07-11 10/2020-07-05 10/2020-07-05 10/2020-07-01 10/2020-06-26 10/2020-06-25 10/2020-06-24 20/2020-06-21 20/2020-06-21 50/2020-06-20 20/2020-06-20 10/2020-06-20 5/2020-06-20 5/2020-06-20 20/2020-06-20 50/2020-06-20 10",https://www.justgiving.com/deeleyscottygeen,2020-10-15,1803,1500,"Luke's Lands End to John O'groats page"

Our local foodbanks do an amazing job for those in need. we As a family wanted to give up something we love, something that would impact on our enjoyment. We are not big drinkers, we don’t smoke. However, we do absolutely love chocolate, cake, sweets and treats (especially the twins). Therefore we are going totally sugar free for January to raise money for our local foodbank. January is a hard time for many families, not just the ones out of work, even working families are using our foodbanks. So donate to our page please. Let’s make a difference. We will keep you updated with our progress along the way. I’m super proud of the twins for agreeing to this, although I don’t think they really realise that sugar is everywhere 🤣🤣🤣</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
