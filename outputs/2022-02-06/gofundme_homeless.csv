Or what it feels like to not be able to eat when your hungry or change your clothes when your cold and wet ? Having people walk past you and look down upon you whilst insulting you ? Enduring long cold days and nights and just dreaming of change? This is the hard cold reality of what’s really going on in our city centres  these men are someone’s son   someone’s brother   and someone’s dad they are just men like the rest of us that have been dealt some unfortunate luck. We are committed on doing our bit to help and support them   so let’s think of them at this cold festive time. We can not change the world but we can the lives of people in this world  Please help us by donating so we can help the less fortunate than ourselves ❤️  MENTalk community members will be coming together to perform a cover of Band Aid’s do they know it’s Christmas We will also be staying on the streets on Birmingham for 48hrs to show you what’s it’s really like to be homeless         Join our private community here >https://www.facebook.com/groups/wearementalkVisit us here >https://www.mentalk.onlineLike & Share Here >https://www.facebook.com/WeAreMENTalk#community #mentalhealth #mensmentalhealth #MENTALK #anxiety #mentalhealthawareness #baxi #baxiboilers #MENTalk ",False

Just in the last few months we have rehoused 7 people who have come on to the bus and now rehoused in local hostels with one who now has his own room in a shared property and back working full time.     We also run a community food bank which is a vital service for those who need emergency food parcels.     We have proven the bus to work but with winter here our furniture sales have slowed down and we really need some funding in to least cover us for the next few months so we can keep the bus running.     I have put our costs below  all money is spent on keeping our services running.     Unit & storage rent: £500 this is where our bus is parked and also our storage container.   Telephone & internet system: £20 per month. This is for our landline number for people to get in touch with us.  Petrol: £100 a month to help with volunteers cars.   Waste collection: £20 a month   Portaloo: £25 a week plus vat - we need to get one down yard so we have two toilets on site.   Insurance: £110 a month.   Other costs: around £300 monthly this could be things like topping up first aid box  topping up equipment on the bus or carrying out dbs checks.   These are our main costs we need to cover every month just to run if you could please make a donation and share.   You can see what we do on our Facebook page Norwich Homeless Support.       ",False
