Last year as a group we raised a whopping £3 000 !! Which was a massive increase on 2019. This year we are looking to smash that record again - with your help!!  Mine (and your) contribution last year was £275 which I am so grateful for - but it would be amazing to beat that this year!!    We are just a group of friends who raise money every year in the run up to Christmas to buy food for local food banks around the South Birmingham area.   Now more than ever  your donations and support will mean so much more.  COVID has caused complications and tough situations for everybody  some more than others. Food banks were crying out for food to support local communities last year and this year is no different!!    Any and all donations are hugely appreciated and will go directly to purchasing food and non-perishables requested by the local food banks!!    Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you in advance for your generous donation - you have made a massive difference!!",False

Even though this year has been mad for everyone there is still a lot of people who do not have the support & luxuries that most of us probably take for granted.  Sadly we are still live in a world where people and their families need your support. So again for this Christmas I will be doing a collection for Waterlooville food bank. I will be raising money which will go towards requested gifts for the families or can collect donations of presents/gifts - anything is acceptable!!     If you are in a position to donate anything at all I urge you to do so! It doesn’t have to be much & doesn’t have to be through me  even if over the next couple of weeks you can add a few extra bits to your shopping for your local food bank at a supermarket  anything helps!     So if you have a little extra money to donate this Christmas  I can guarantee there will be someone out there who will really appreciate it!     Please message me if you would like to donate gifts towards this and I’m more than happy to collect any local donations if required!!I will be looking to have donations by the 15th December 2021.",False

We use the van each week to collect and deliver donated essential furniture such as beds and cookers to people in need. Without a working van  our ability to help people most in need across Wells and the surrounding villages will be more limited. Demand for help from Wells Vineyard Foodbank & Furniture Storehouse has risen 6-fold during the pandemic. In 2021  over 80 000 meals have been distributed in our area. People are referred by support agencies  GPs and schools and will receive a food box with approximately 4 days worth of food with 3 meals a day plus toiletries.     The Furniture Storehouse recycles donated furniture  stores it and distributes it free upon referral. In 2021  266 items of essential furniture such as beds and white goods were delivered to people in desperate need. Without a working van  we can no longer offer this service. We already have a third of the money we need to buy a van  but need your help to make this happen! You can make a difference by donating today to WELLS VINEYARD CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP.

I am trying to raise funds  just a small amount  to help 2 friends who are expecting a baby to get by until their benefits are sorted out!   The young couple in question would help anyone in the best way they could  but they now need just a little bit of help themselves! I am going to keep their names to myself so as to not cause them any embarrassment  not that they should feel any  a lot of us have been in similar situations. I will refer to them as R (female) & A (Male). Due to severe illness  and being 31 weeks pregnant  R is unable to work at present  and A is her carer.   Unfortunately they have hit hard times  getting a little behind with things  and have recently been going without food and heating due to lack of accessible funds. At present they are awaiting benefits decisions which as a lot of people know can sometimes take weeks  even months. They have tried everything to speed things along  have been refused help from the council where they live  citizens advice bureau told them there was nothing they can do but wait  and the food bank only allows a household to visit for supplies 1 a month! They have electricity  but no gas for heating  they have no food in and have been surviving on little bits they have managed to acquire here and there. They have no immediate family that can help either! Needless to say all of the stress is affecting R's health even further  physically and mentally  and is also putting the baby at risk!!   I have loaned them a little personally  until they can afford to repay it  but it wasn't much  they are worrying about that too even though I have told them not to and I'm in no rush  but their situation is worsening day by day!   Please could you find it in your hearts to help them get past this rough patch and back on their feet by donating just a small amount towards helping a wonderful young couple pull through their tough time! I would sincerely appreciate any donation  however small! All moneys will be transferred straight to their account to help them purchase food  gas & other essential items! Thanks",False
