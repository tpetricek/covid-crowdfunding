For many the Salvation Army is the only friend they have. We will never stop doing all we can to help people in desperate need by giving them food, shelter, practical support and friendship and yet we cannot do this alone. As a charity we need your support more than ever to keep our vital services running.</p><p>Every year the Salvation Army in Chippenham takes part in the Salvation Army Big Collection, raising vital funds to the wider work of the Salvation Army across the UK. We normally spend the beginning of September delivering Big Collection envelops to homes around Chippenham and collecting them back in with your amazingly kind donations!&nbsp;</p><p><span>This year as a Corps we do not feel it is right for us to knock on doors to collect the envelopes back in. We are conscious that in the current climate additional visitors to the door in close proximity will be an uncomfortable experience. We are, therefore, taking a different approach! Envelopes will still be delivered and we are asking that they either be sent back to us here at the Salvation Army in Chippenham or they can be posted back to Salvation Army Headquarters using the free post envelope. Our Just Giving page details are also included so that donations can be made through this page and we have taking to step to increasing our just giving target by £5000!&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>We are so grateful for the support we have received from the people of Chippenham over this last 18 months both financially and through well wishes and moral support. Without the support of people in our towns and city the work of the Salvation Army would not be able to happen, every penny you give is used to change the life of someone in need so thank you!</p>",208,208,"2022-01-02 30/2021-12-23 20/2021-12-16 30/2021-12-16 500/2021-12-11 20/2021-12-03 20/2021-05-04 40/2021-04-24 400/2021-04-23 30/2021-04-20 7/2021-04-14 10/2021-04-14 5/2021-04-13 10/2021-04-02 20/2021-03-26 25/2021-03-05 22/2021-03-03 20/2021-03-01 100/2021-02-27 200/2021-02-27 500/2021-02-25 15/2021-02-16 50/2021-01-24 30/2021-01-12 30/2021-01-11 50/2021-01-06 25/2021-01-05 100/2021-01-05 500/2021-01-03 10/2021-01-02 200/2020-12-28 200/2020-12-24 50/2020-12-23 50/2020-12-23 30/2020-12-22 10/2020-12-22 100/2020-12-22 9/2020-12-21 50/2020-12-21 50/2020-12-19 40/2020-12-18 75/2020-12-18 26/2020-12-18 200/2020-12-16 125/2020-12-16 10/2020-12-16 100/2020-12-12 50/2020-12-08 220/2020-12-07 10/2020-12-07 10/2020-12-06 30/2020-12-02 10/2020-12-01 30/2020-12-01 10/2020-11-30 30/2020-11-26 50/2020-11-25 10/2020-11-24 20/2020-11-23 50/2020-11-21 10/2020-11-20 10/2020-11-20 10/2020-11-20 10/2020-11-19 100/2020-11-17 30/2020-11-17 30/2020-11-16 100/2020-11-10 20/2020-11-09 20/2020-11-06 50/2020-11-03 100/2020-11-02 50/2020-11-02 10/2020-10-30 20/2020-10-27 100/2020-10-27 30/2020-10-26 50/2020-10-24 10/2020-10-24 20/2020-10-23 10/2020-10-23 50/2020-10-23 100/2020-10-23 30/2020-10-15 30/2020-10-07 100/2020-10-04 30/2020-09-29 20/2020-09-28 30/2020-09-28 20/2020-08-25 30/2020-07-29 100/2020-07-17 350/2020-07-12 50/2020-07-08 30/2020-07-06 20/2020-07-06 20/2020-07-05 20/2020-07-05 30/2020-07-04 20/2020-07-04 10/2020-07-04 20/2020-07-04 20/2020-07-04 100/2020-07-04 20/2020-07-03 20/2020-07-03 30/2020-07-03 10/2020-07-02 20/2020-06-24 250/2020-06-22 100/2020-06-16 30/2020-06-13 5/2020-06-10 100/2020-05-30 20/2020-05-27 10/2020-05-17 100/2020-05-17 50/2020-05-13 10/2020-05-12 200/2020-05-07 500/2020-05-06 225/2020-05-01 20/2020-05-01 156/2020-04-29 15/2020-04-28 50/2020-04-28 50/2020-04-28 50/2020-04-24 20/2020-04-22 20/2020-04-21 20/2020-04-19 100/2020-04-19 10/2020-04-18 50/2020-04-18 20/2020-04-18 20/2020-04-18 50/2020-04-18 10/2020-04-18 10/2020-04-17 20/2020-04-17 30/2020-04-17 5/2020-04-17 5/2020-04-17 20/2020-04-17 30",https://www.justgiving.com/Chippenham-Corps-Community-Centre-Salvation-Army,2022-01-28,16266,20000,"Chippenham Salvation Army Appeal"

Of this number 1,424 went to children.

The 6+ week waiting period for a first payment can contribute to debt, mental health issues and rent arrears. The effects of these can last even after people receive their Universal Credit payments, as bills and debts pile up. Hamilton District Foodbank is working hard to stop local people affected going hungry but is troubled by the extra pressure this puts on food donation stocks and volunteers’ time and emotional welfare.</p><p>As well as providing emergency food, Hamilton District Foodbank provides essentials like washing powder, nappies and sanitary products to families who are struggling, as well as signposting them to other services in the local area.

Every week people are referred to us after being hit by something unavoidable – such as illness, a delay in a benefit payment or an unexpected bill – means food is simply unaffordable. It really is only with the community’s support that we’re able to provide vital emergency help when it matters most, and we hope that one day there will be no need for us in Hamilton District. But until that day comes, we will continue to offer the best possible service to help local people facing a crisis. Thank you so much to everyone in Hamilton District who already donates time, food and money to help local people.

The fundamental idea of the business is to provide healthy affordable food in the takeaway market were the fundamentals of cooking, seasonality and wonderful flavours would be at the for front of everything we do. Transferring the the skills I have learnt and will continue to learn from the incredible chefs I work alongside at Le Manior. Chef Gary Jones told me during my interview at Le Manior that food has the power to create happiness and escape from the world we face, which I've been told from my incredible customers my food has been doing for them. Pursuing my dream of becoming a chef has for the last 18 months of my life has been integral to every life decision I have made and this in turn has given me such incredible happiness, friends and experiences which I'm truly grateful for.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>However, In a turn of events three weeks ago when the country entered lock down, I like so many other chefs had the daunting news that we were no longer were allowed to go into work. This lead to huge worries as I was working on a zero hour contract at Le Manior, the fear I was no longer going to have any stream of income over the next few months hit home hard. So after lengthy discussion with my parents &nbsp;in the car journey home from celebrating my mothers retirement at Le Manior. The decision was made to start cooking meals for local people in Compton Dando and the surrounding villages to raise some money to cover my essential bills. Over the last three weeks we have been incredibly busy, serving food on 16 of the 21 days of lockdown and selling over 400 meals out of two ovens and 5 burners stove. However, through the incredible generosity of Belmond and the team at Le Manior I have retained 100% of my wage which has meant this money I had been earning was no longer needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, Like everyone else I have been watching the news every day for updates on the corona virus crisis and one story stood out in particular and that was of the massive rise of need for food banks and the decrease in funding and donations.This lead to phoning up the local food bank in Keynsham (Trussel trust). The discovering news was worrying, they had seen a 1000% increase in people using their service at several collection points in Keynsham and the surrounding area. They had also seen a huge drop in food bank donations and money coming into support their service. Therefore, Dan&amp;I have decided to pledge £500 of the money Hafu has earned over the last three weeks towards the Trussel trust and helping those most vulnerable in society. &nbsp;</p><p>If you could donate anything on top of this, it would be hugely appreciated by those most in need.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay safe,</p><p>Dan&amp;Will&nbsp;</p>",34,34,"2020-06-14 30/2020-06-14 30/2020-04-29 10/2020-04-23 30/2020-04-20 30/2020-04-19 30/2020-04-19 30/2020-04-17 30/2020-04-17 44/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-14 30/2020-04-14 50/2020-04-14 20/2020-04-14 20/2020-04-13 100/2020-04-13 30/2020-04-13 20/2020-04-13 50/2020-04-13 20/2020-04-12 20/2020-04-12 10/2020-04-12 20/2020-04-12 10/2020-04-12 10/2020-04-12 500",https://www.justgiving.com/Hafu,2020-06-14,1464,1000,"Hafu foodbank fundraiser "

The main earner was self-employed and his business had been forced to stop. As you may know, that means the family will not receive support until June. The lady that answered the door ended up in tears as she explained that she never expected to be in this situation.

This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

Since April and all through the lockdown, the Southwark Foodbank has been delivering food parcels instead of people collecting them from centres and more than ever are relying on the public's support to keep the services running for even more people. In April alone, foodbank usage went up by 400% in Southwark.

To keep supporters safe, the foodbank is encouraging donations of Funds For Food, instead of physical food donations. 

Help us support the Southwark Foodbank with a small donation to keep them going strong as we head into Autumn and celebrate Harvest, giving to those in our community who might be struggling to afford food even more than normal because of COVID-19.

For people on low incomes, a sudden crisis  redundancy, benefit delay, illness or even an unexpected bill  can mean going hungry. Every day parents skip meals to feed their children and people are forced to choose between paying the rent or eating.

Since our launch weve given away over 100 tonnes of food to over 12,500 people in need, including almost 5,000 local children.

We are part of The Trussell Trusts UK-wide foodbank network, and together we provide food to thousands of people nationwide every year. The Foodbank is hosted at the Oasis Centre, St Johns Waterloo and St George the Martyr on behalf of South Bank Churches.

This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

This of course means that my walking will have to take place very early in the morning or late at night so every walk apart from the weekends will have to be in the dark. However, I am hoping that the Covid situation will at some point allow many more people to come and join me whenever they feel like doing so. If this is the case then I will fix a regular walk for people to do just that or join for even part of that days walk.</p><p>At 57 it didn't take me long to add those extra pounds that I lost during last years walk so it will be good for my own health too.&nbsp;</p><p>I will continue to make sure that a walk takes place every single day come rain, shine, snow and those winds that I experienced last year. Occasionally I will be outside of Weymouth due to social events and family visits but will still get a walk in and post the photos. I am hoping to be in Hamburg, Germany for a couple of days in March so that will be a good one along with visits to London along the way.</p><p>Once again I will be donating £50 for every completed sale throughout the whole of 2022 and hope that we can smash the total achieved in 2021.

I've practiced this for nearly 6 months now, I'm also fat adapted so I burn fat instead of glucose for fuel.  Fat lasts much much longer and gives the body what it needs when you can't eat.  This is similar to the ancestral human diet and is what would've happened if they were unable to hunt anything for days.  After a certain period of fasting your body enters into autophagy, where your cells recycle and rejuvenate and get rid of any bad cells.  This is normally the aim for someone doing an extended fast and it's amazing.  So please don't be concerned, I know what I'm doing and there'll be no harm done :)<br></p>",33,33,"2021-04-10 5/2021-04-04 5/2021-04-04 10/2021-04-03 10/2021-04-02 20/2021-04-01 10/2021-04-01 100/2021-03-31 5/2021-03-31 20/2021-03-31 10/2021-03-31 5/2021-03-30 20/2021-03-29 10/2021-03-28 10/2021-03-27 20/2021-03-26 10/2021-03-26 30/2021-03-26 10/2021-03-26 20/2021-03-06 10/2021-03-04 25/2021-03-04 10/2021-03-04 30/2021-03-04 10/2021-03-04 40/2021-03-04 5",https://www.justgiving.com/Jack-McCauley-Deehan7DayFast,2021-04-10,535,0,"Jack's 7 Day fast for South-West Belfast foodbank"

S6 Foodbank are expecting the increased need to continue for the foreseeable future, as more people experience difficulty as a result of coronavirus and its wider consequences. I believe that nobody in Sheffield should have to face going hungry.

Just donating what you can AND also sharing this page can make a huge difference. I'll be living on £1/day for 6 days at the end of July.</p><p><span><b>Live Below The Line</b></span></p><p><span>Live below the line is a challenge from The Hunger Project. It is quite simply - live below the line for a given time period. Sometimes a day, sometimes 5.</span></p><p><span>The aim is to raise awareness of extreme poverty abroad, nationally and at home, and to raise funds.</span></p><p><span>The line is the world extreme poverty line, below which 1.2 billion people live. That's a mind boggling number. The line is £1 a day. £1 a day for food - all your food for one day.</span></p><p><span>Bringing closer to home: 13 million people live in poverty in the UK. 600,000 of those live in Greater Manchester - 1 in 4 people. 3.9 million children in the UK live in poverty. 91,000 of those are children - the majority have 1 or more parents in work.</span></p><p><span>These are the people that access foodbanks - over 1 million times in the past year. 1 million times when someone would go hungry instead.</span></p><p>They do this week in, week out, unrelentingly.</p><p><b>6 pounds, 6 days</b></p><p>As a result, I will live below the line for 6 days. That's the 5 days people normally do, with a day on top. I'll be doing this from Sunday 23rd July 2017 to Friday 28th July 2017.</p><p><b>Why Manchester Food Bank</b></p><p>It's on our doorstep. It's personal. 1 in 4 people in manchester are in poverty. No-one chooses poverty - poverty chooses them. Manchester Food Bank was seeded by the Trussel Trust, and supported by them as part of their national collective of foodbanks.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Why am I doing this?</b><br></p><p>I'm doing this because I think modern society should be able to exist without people living on the borders of starvation.  Many years ago I had to live on a similar budget to this, but I think things have become worse. I was lucky enough to be able to use education to lift myself out of that. Many people are not lucky enough to do that. In the absence of change, they need assistance.</p><p>I feel strongly that foodbanks should not need to exist, and that they are a failure of society. Until they're no longer needed, those using foodbanks need help.</p><p>Lastly, it's in essence to raise awareness and to try and do something positive that I couldn't do myself.</p><p><b>Why such a high target?</b></p><p>Because it matters. I've picked a figure that is achievable and would make a difference. Yes, it's a hard target, but if I get 1/2 way there I will have succeeded. Every level of support helps. Some baseline numbers: £10 buys a basket of food for an emergency food parcel, £25 buys a family 3 days of food. (£2/day is not luxury), £50 restocks supplies on the things the food back runs short of for 1 week</p><p>Which ever way you look at it, the target makes a difference.<br></p><ul><li>Helps 100 families over a difficult period. Just 100 families. On average 400 people.?</li><li>Or it helps 250 people in a period of emergency<br></li><li>Or it helps the foodbank for a whole year to not worry about things they run short of.</li></ul><p>No matter the actual amount raised though, it makes a difference.<br><br>Bear in mind:</p><ul><li>How much do you spend on entertainment a week / a month? Can you go without that once?</li><li>Rather than a take away, can you cook at home instead?<br></li><li>If you're contemplating a new gadget, can you wait a month and instead donate 1/12th the cost?</li><li>As little as £1 helps, that seems like a little, but it can /literally/ be a day's food for someone.<br></li></ul><p>You might not be in a position to help financially. I get that.</p><ul><li>If you can't give, please share this page, this helps. Each time you share this page, you increase the chances of another £10 towards the goal.</li><li>Failing that, please add foods to a collection point. It goes directly to helping the same foodbanks.</li></ul><p><b>Gift Aid</b><br><br>Please, PLEASE, please gift aid your donation if you can. It boosts the intake. it means that every £20 donated raises £25 for the charity - with the extra £5 coming from taxes you already pay - forcing the govt to do a tiny fraction of their part too.<br></p><div><b>Donate via text</b></div><div><b><br></b>You can also donate via mobile phone. Examples:</div><ul dir=""ltr""><li>If you want to donate 5 days' food - £10 - you do this by texting ""MCFB75 £10"" to 70070</li><li>If you want to donate a day's food - £2 - you do this by texting ""MCFB75 £2"" to 70070</li></ul><p><b>Practicalities</b><br><br>I'll track my progress here: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/sparkslabs . I'll provide proof of costs here as well. The key practicality is that you can only eat foods you buy that week.<br><br>One common/small exception I've noticed is people allow themselves salt and pepper. (Since you buy those very very rarely, and use fractions of a penny if that if anything) But no spices, *nothing* else you might take for granted.<br></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

,,,1169735,"Little Village",False,2020-07-06,"<p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>When I came across the work that Little Village do I was stunned. It’s<span>&nbsp;like a foodbank, but instead of food, it offers essential items like clothing, books, toys and baby equipment to parents in need, right across London. It’s frankly alarming that thousands of families need to rely on ‘hand me downs’ and the good will of other people to barely survive. This is just for essential items. I am saddened that in this day and age tiny babies and children under 5 are going without the most basic of items right here in London, items I completely took for granted when I was pregnant and during the early years of my children growing up.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Can you imagine trying to breastfeed your little one without any breast pads to pop in after? Or not having enough nappies? Imagine not being able to clothe your children appropriately. Imagine trying to entertain your smallest children without the most basic of toys or books?&nbsp;</span></p><p>This is where I think I can make a small difference. As part of my ongoing #asyouaremotherhood campaign across Instagram and Facebook, I'm celebrating and highlighting those of us (silent) women heroes, who everyday, do all we can to provide for our children and to be the best mothers we can be.</p><p>There is such a pressure for us mums to be perfect: we all strive for perfection everyday when the reality is, perfection doesn't exist.</p><p>We all worry, are anxious about whether we're doing the right thing for our unborn baby or the children we already have. We can look at others and think they're somehow doing it better than us, and feel like we've failed.</p><p>We must change our attitudes and change the way we treat ourselves.</p><p>That's why I'm giving away a limited number of mother and baby photoshoots to celebrate how amazing and unique we are as mothers, how we ARE doing all we can to help our children.&nbsp;</p><p>And that our best is good enough. We are good enough.</p><p>Through this project, I can ask pregnant women and mums to come into my studio, get a fabulous photoshoot to show how fabulous they are (just as they are without the need for fancy or OTT props) - and spread the word about self-love and acceptance.&nbsp;</p><p>And then in return all I'd ask is a contribution to Little Village.</p><p><span>This is my way to give back to some struggling families on my own doorstep? Little Village does just that; giving the gift of the most basic but essential things to babies and children who really need them.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>As their website says: “It takes a village to raise a child - this is especially true in London where we often feel alone as parents.</span></p><p><span>“L</span><span>ittle Village is a gift from one family to another, passed on with love.”</span><br></p><p><span>If I ask each of my photography clients to donate, say, just £20 to this cause, I would forgo my booking fee of usually £95. Clients could of course donate more if they wish or were able to, but I thought this would be an excellent start.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So if you're keen to book a Maternity or Baby photoshoot with me, I’ll direct you to this page where you can donate what you can and then we’ll see what happens. Things will snowball from there. Let’s do this together and be part of something hopeful to change the world we live in, right on our doorsteps.</span></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

The Trussell Trust aims to end the need for food banks and at this time needs all the help it can get. 100,000 people needed foodbanks for the first time at the start of the pandemic and this Christmas, 670,000 more people will fall into destitution and become unable to afford the essentials of life, let alone the luxuries we all enjoy at Christmas.</p><p><span>Last year, food banks in our network provided more than 1.6 million emergency food parcels to people in crisis. More than half a million of these went to children. It’s not right that people can’t afford the basics. With your help, we can help end the need for food banks.As a nation, we expect no one should be left hungry or destitute. Illness, disability, family breakdown or the loss of a job can happen to any of us. With your help #ThisCanChange</span></p><p><span>Walking in the beautiful Hampshire countryside is something I enjoy doing most days, so I wanted to set myself the goal of walking a total of 100 miles between the start of the second lockdown (November 5th) and December 31st with the aim of raising £1, 000 for the Trussell Trust.

However the outbreak of the Coronavirus has quite literally changed everyones lives and turned society upside down.However, The Salvation Army is resolute and strong and just as we did in the Spanish Flu pandemic, and during the bombing and the Blitz we will carry on, doing what we can to support people and communities  in the ways that we can, within the Government guidelines.In true Salvation Army Spirit, our greatest strength is our flexible, responsive local presence. Right now, each of our 650 corps and community centres will know exactly what the most effective things are to do.

Admittedly i'm not going to be running a marathon or swimming the channel or even walking a 100 laps around my flat I just want to do something silly and raise a little bit of money for someone, all i'm going to be doing is dying my hair my fiances favourite colour of purple. If this dying malarkey fails (because shes doing it lol) i will be having to say good bye to my hair period that i've been trying to grow back for nearly a year now!!!!!!!! i know and understand my target isn't to the colonels level but every little helps but for every extra £50 i am agreeing to keep my hair purple/shaved for every month after lockdown aswell. so for example if i raise £100 i have to keep my hair purple/shaved until we have been out of lockdown for a month, £150 would be 2 months so on and so forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span>More and more people are being forced to use food banks because they cannot afford the basics in life. Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.</span></p>",5,5,"2020-05-03 10/2020-05-03 20/2020-05-03 10/2020-05-03 10/2020-05-02 10",https://www.justgiving.com/Sam-Dams,2020-05-03,60,50,"Going Purple!"

Fortunately, my accomplice for the day, Nick Green, had not and was making tea for a quick vigil on the back patio before we set out on the long tramp around Wivenhoe.<br>Although I had done some scouting for key breeding birds on territory, the cold, windy conditions would make it something of a lottery on the day – especially at dawn – as to whether the birds would betray their presence with any song.<br>The Tawny Owls we might have hoped to hear from the back patio drew a blank. The wind was such that we could not hear anything from the estuary as we sometimes can, so we set off at 04.55 for Ferry Marsh. High tide, for what it was worth (it wasn’t going to be e big one) was at around 07.30, so we simply walked around ferry marsh on the sea wall (it is still impassable due to flooding) without lingering. We picked up Sedge, Reed and Cettis warbler without any effort, plus Common &amp; Lesser Whitethroat in the dawn chorus. No Chiffchaffs were heard until we walked back through the woods after looping through them from Lower Lodge after the return journey from opposite the Hythe on the trail. Along the river, we predictably scored Greenshank, Nightingale (2 territorial males either side of the river at Hythe), Common Tern and the more common waders, but no Spotted Redshank or Ruff as we might have hoped. A male Sparrowhawk swooped past us near the Uni and Bullfinches were barely audible above the breeze at the level crossing. The otherwise time-saving scope from Lower Lodge to the lagoons was passed up, but at great distance it would have been nigh impossible to see the Green Sandpipers and other smaller waders from that distance. We had seen 3 Avocets on the estuary the previous day, so felt confident that we would connect more easily than a long-range scan. With just over 2 hours to walk to the Hythe and then Wivenhoe Woods en route to Alresford Creek for high tide, we moved quite quickly. No Nightingales were in song in Wivenhoe wood. In fact, very few birds were evident. There were a couple of Jays to keep the total ticking over but by now, the lack of bird song was slightly concerning. A Cuckoo did at least make itself heard from across the river.<br>Back on the trail after Wivenhoe Woods, we connected with House Martins around West Quay. The walk to the creek yielded only Whimbrel and Bar-tailed Godwit, so we arrived at the metal bench with 40 minutes to scan across to Geedon Marsh before our breakfast rendezvous with Mark Norrington. A brief stop at the barrier did not yield Grey Wagtail, as hoped.<br>The vigil and the walk along to the bottom of Ford Lane for bacon rolls and coffee, courtesy of Mark, moved the species total from 62 to 71. We darted back to the creek mouth watch point as the wader and wildfowl count to that point was paltry... It seemed evident that most, if not all the usual wintering wildfowl and waders had cleared out, such that, other than the plentiful Whimbrels, we did not add anywhere near the numbers at Alresford that we had hoped, with Golden, Grey and Ringed Plover, Knot, Avocet, Spotted Redshank and Common Sandpiper all absent, as well as Wigeon, Teal and Brent Goose – all of which we would have expected.<br>We felt that we were 15 species short of where we needed to be when we dragged ourselves away from the creek with 79 species to our name, with one Mediterranean Gull making itself heard above the breeze. At least Little Owl provided an easy hit at Plumptons farm; Buzzards and Marsh Harriers were showing regularly without any thermals to speak of, but there were no more exotic raptors or larger migrants to add. We would have another chance with a later (not very) high tide late in the day, but at this stage, a total of 100 looked very distant, if not impossible without a significant fall of passage migrants. The walk along Cutthroat Lane to Sunnymead &amp; Cockaynes was very quiet. Our remaining hopes of Treecreeper and Coal Tit would be at Cockaynes or Villa wood.<br>To our abject dismay, there was no Willow Warbler or Garden Warbler in song at Cockaynes. As the clock neared 1pm, I called Debbie to suggest she stays at home rather than deliver our lunch. Discretion became the better part and we managed to trek across Ballast Quay track to aarive back at home for an extended lunch break and a discussion on how we were even going to get over 90, let alone 100.<br>The biggest gaps in the list of hopefuls (if no longer probables) were of estuarine species, notable by their absence in the first tidal phase. Other incidental passerine species and their likely sites were well spread across the area. The other issue was that Nick had only just recovered from illness and we had already walked 12 miles on just a few hours sleep...<br>By the time we had eaten as many turkey sandwiches as we could, Nick had retired for a “lie down”. I thought that this would be effectively the end of his participation so togged up again and decided to head out to the creek, via the trail, to see if I could mop up some migrants and to get much luckier with estuarine species. Realistically, this was highly unlikely, but in the context of achieving the highest possible total, this was the obvious option. <br>To my amazement, as I neared the jetty, Nick called to say that he had woken after barely 30 minutes! We agreed to meet at the creek. By then, I had caught up with the pair of Grey Wagtails on the barrier having heard the male gently singing there from the jetty. The two birds showed briefly before I marched determinedly toward Nick.<br>Whilst there was nothing new on Barrier Marsh, I was tempted to stop briefly for a Nightingale that was very close to the path in an elevated position. I managed to zoom through a small opening to pick out the bird with the camera and stole quite a pleasing shot.<br>By the time I reached Nick at the bench, all threats of rain had gone and we enjoyed the next 90 minutes in mostly bright sunshine, doing our best to identify silhouetted images between us and Geedon saltings.<br>In this time, Nick did brilliantly to pick out a lone Brent Goose and I was able to lock on to a Great White Egret over the saltings. This put us on 82 for the day, but it was now obvious that the estuarine species had all but moved on. A flock of Dunlins were still in the creek, some of which were in almost full summer plumage, as were the Turnstones and 2 of the half dozen or so Bar-tailed Godwits to raise the spirits a little.<br>Had we stayed out for the rest of the day until dark, we might have added 2 or 3 more species, but there was no way we were going to get near 100, so we called it a day and declared our innings total at 82 species with 17 miles walked.<br>At the time of writing, we have raised £320 plus GiftAid. I will be doing other activities in a bid to raise this, including a bird finding schedule and making greeting cards with wildlife photos to benefit the Food Bank. <br><br><br><br><br></p><p><br></p>",15,15,"2019-04-28 10/2019-04-28 30/2019-04-27 30/2019-04-26 10/2019-04-26 10/2019-04-25 30/2019-04-25 20/2019-04-22 30/2019-04-12 50/2019-03-27 10/2019-03-19 20/2019-03-18 10/2019-03-18 20/2019-03-18 30",https://www.justgiving.com/Glyn-EvansWivBirds,2019-04-28,320,1000,"Glyn's Wivenhoe Bird Race"

It all started then. <br><br>What has this got to do with Rutland Food Bank, you ask?<br>Well, nothing.<br>But while I was once doing quite well and was going out walking everyday, I have allowed myself to become stuck in a rut again - afraid to go out apart from a few regular places that I know, when I have someone to go with me...</p><p>This morning I really wanted to go for a walk, but, I found myself ""stuck"". Too afraid to get in the car and go... This is crazy. I used to walk around Hambleton Peninsular almost every day, and now I find myself too scared to go... I need an incentive...<br><br>So, I have decided that I need to tell the world (well, Rutland anyway!) that I'm going for a walk, so that you can hold me to account if I don't! But more than that, I thought it would be nice if I can raise some money for those in the local community who are struggling at the moment.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm going to try to walk1000miles again in 2021 having not completed the challenge during 2020 - and to start me off I would like to walk the first 5 days for the people of Rutland. I will walk around Hambleton Peninsular at Rutland water once each day and hope to raise £50 for Rutland Food Bank - any more than that would be fantastic! I myself will donate £2 per day which I will add as one payment of £10 at the end of the 5 days.<br><br>(I just want to add a little disclaimer here incase any new Covid Restrictions come into force which prevent me from walking around Hambleton Peninsular on any or all of the first 5 days of January. If this does happen I will walk as soon as any new restrictions are lifted.)</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

So it's the most efficient way to donate - saving time and cutting costs for the charity.</p><p>You may remember a few years ago, when I got involved in a mad plan to walk 12 walks of 12 miles to mark the 12 men who take their own lives every day!&nbsp; As a team, we managed to raised something like £4,000 for two mental health charities: Movember and CALM. We called it ""Walk This Way"" - inspired by the classic collaboration between Aerosmith and Run DMC. Collaboration was at the heart of the project, and I remain fiercely proud of what we achieved together.</p><p>This time, it is a solo challenge! I've taken my inspiration from ""500 Miles (I'm Gonna Be)"" by The Proclaimers. Just like the song, I'm going to walk 500 miles.&nbsp; All walks will be done to be COVID secure and in accordance with the latest guidance from government whether we are in lockdown or out of lockdown. The focus of my challenge this time is to raise money for the amazing Newquay Foodbank who do so much to support the most vulnerable families in this incredible community. It is especially important that these families are supported now, especially as more families have found themselves in unexpected financial hardship as a result of COVID restrictions and two national Lockdowns.&nbsp;</p><p>From a personal perspective, I know what it is like to grow up in a family that was subject to financial hardship and the shadow of poverty when my dad was unemployed back in the 1980s. I remember the humiliation heaped upon me from others as I had to wear second hand clothes (not vintage or pre-loved as they are often referred to now). The memory of that was one of the defining factors that resulted in me becoming a secondary school teacher.&nbsp; It makes me beyond sad to consider that there will be children in Newquay today who will experience the same or similar things to those that I experienced back when I was young.</p><p>So please support me in this challenge. Please spread the news of what I'm trying to do on social media. Please spread the stories of how Newquay Foodbank (and other equally wonderful charities and organisations) are helping those people who are most in need of our help.</p><p>And finally... will you be one of my 500 smiles?&nbsp; I'm looking for at least 500 wonderful people who are willing to donate to this Just Giving page a minimum of £5.00 to support the work of Newquay Foodbank throughout this Lockdown and whatever comes after it. That would raise a lot of money to help a lot of people right here in Newquay.</p><p>Here's one final music reference for you - anybody and everybody who contributes money to this fundraiser for Newquay Foodbank would undoubtedly become one of my ""Heroes""... but for more than one day.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",25,25,"2021-02-10 20/2021-02-05 10/2021-02-05 20/2021-02-05 10/2021-02-04 10/2021-02-04 20/2021-02-03 10/2021-02-03 10/2021-02-03 5/2021-02-03 5/2021-02-03 10/2021-02-03 5/2021-02-02 10/2021-02-01 20/2021-02-01 10/2021-02-01 10/2021-01-22 10/2021-01-22 5",https://www.justgiving.com/Grahaeme-Jones500m,2021-03-30,270,1000,"Grahaeme's The 500 Mile Challenge"

We say this because it’s not right that anyone cannot afford their own food. That’s why we are working towards a just, compassionate future, where no one should have to use a food bank to get by.

Without the assistance of people and businesses in Sheffield, S6 Foodbank wouldnt be able to continue to support their guests, launch new sites and tackle the ongoing food crisis in Sheffield which is being exacerbated by coronavirus.

S6 Foodbank are expecting the increased need to continue for the foreseeable future, as more people experience difficulty as a result of coronavirus and its wider consequences. I believe that nobody in Sheffield should have to face going hungry. 

A donation of £27 provides food and basic essentials for a family of three for three days. I am aiming to raise at least £40 to help S6 Foodbank reach their £40,000 target. Whatever I raise (up to that target) will be match-funded by the Government via the Love Your Neighbour partnership, meaning S6 Foodbank receives double the amount.

Thank you for sponsoring me, and a huge thank you too from Chris and the team ",11,11,"2020-11-02 20/2020-11-02 20/2020-11-02 20/2020-11-02 10/2020-11-02 20/2020-11-02 10/2020-11-02 10/2020-10-25 10/2020-10-24 10/2020-10-24 10/2020-10-23 25",https://www.justgiving.com/BigAlsBigStepchallenge,2020-11-02,165,200,"ALEXANDRA's Stepping out for S6"

One evening after work I thought F*** THIS and downloaded the couch to 5k app, with some motivation from the mother in law that she’d do it with me, out we went.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span></span><br></p><p><span>I’ve not stopped since.</span></p><p><span></span><br></p><p><span>After 9 weeks of the couch to 5k I continued to run 5k for a minimum of 3 times a week, occasionally adding a 4th in to challenge myself. As months went by I decided to increase the km’s and keep pushing myself and my body to it’s fullest potential. It actually blows my mind what you can put your body through, no matter how tired you are or if your body aches.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span></span><br></p><p><span>The time I spend running is the time I spend on ME, and everyone deserves time spent on themselves.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span></span><br></p><p><span>After years of not even being able to go into a shop alone without having a full blown panic attack I am challenging myself to run the potters arf marathon alone (I wanna be sick).<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span></span><br></p><p><span>After a colleague from work mentioned the Stoke-on-Trent Foodbank and what their charity stood for, it became clear that after the past 12 months this is the charity I wanted to raise money for.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span></span><br></p><p><span>The Stoke-on-Trent Foodbank aim to provide 3 days of emergency food to those who are in crisis either due to; poverty, sudden loss of income, bereavement, domestic violence, illness and other crisis within their family.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>Their services include; money or debt advice, specialist housing support, mental health, drug and alcohol issues and social care.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span></span><br></p><p><span>Highlighted above are just some of the services that COVID would of made 10x harder for families during this pandemic.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span></span><br></p><p><span>With the help from my lovely family and friends I am hoping to raise enough money to help Stoke-on-Trent.

,,,1157499,"North Bristol Foodbank",False,2019-12-18,"<p>As somebody who was lucky enough to be born round about this<br>time of year, December’s always been a month of receiving for me. This year I’d like to change that, and instead of receiving presents I’d like to give something back to a community that is now in need of help more than ever. </p><p>Having had a rather hedonistic time at uni (still embarrassed<br>about that time I ate a whole pasta bake for four in one sitting tbh), and in light of the political events of last week, I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting on my own relative privilege and the state of the world around me. You can’t really turn on the news, or go on social media without being reminded that the world is a Horrible Place, and there’s very little you can do about it. Bad people are in charge, everything is getting hotter, and I’m never going to reach 5’4”. It’s all very disheartening.</p><p>So if other people can’t make good things happen, I’m going<br>to try my very best to do it myself. During the pre-election madness, I saw numerous statistics on Twitter that really shocked me, and in particular quite a few on food bank usage in the UK. More people are using food banks than ever before, and this number has increased from the tens of thousands in 2010 to the millions this year. The reasons behind this increase can be disputed to no end, but I think regardless of political persuasion you can agree that they’re a<br>highly valuable resource for many. One that shouldn’t need to exist, but one that pretty much means life or death for those that need them.</p><p>For that reason I’d like to collect donations for the North<br>Bristol Foodbank this year, the foodbank that’s local to both myself and many of you that I know. There’s been a 54% increase in demand from North Bristol foodbank from April-Sept 2019, and as the winter draws in, the demand only increases. Christmas isn’t going to be the best time of year for many, and even if you can’t donate I hope you can keep them on your mind over the festive season. </p><p>I’ve created this page for any donations you’d like<br>to make! I would appreciate them much more than any Christmas/birthday presents (although if you’ve already bought them, I won’t say no…), and they’ll do much more good as well. Also, if you’re around to give me something in person, you have no excuse now <span>😊</span></p><p>Thanks!</p>",20,20,"2019-12-27 10/2019-12-27 15/2019-12-27 30/2019-12-26 20/2019-12-25 15/2019-12-24 50/2019-12-22 10/2019-12-20 5/2019-12-19 20/2019-12-19 20/2019-12-19 10/2019-12-19 5/2019-12-19 20/2019-12-19 20/2019-12-18 5/2019-12-18 10/2019-12-18 12/2019-12-18 3",https://www.justgiving.com/mee-mee-turns-19,2019-12-27,328,300,"Mee-Mee's Birthday"

And for just £5 you get a couple of photos to remind you of a time you're unlikely to ever forget and the Mid Cheshire Foodbank gets 100% of that fee.

,,,1150820,"Stoke-on-Trent Foodbank",False,2021-11-21,"<p><br><span>For the third year running, The Wizards of Drivel Podcast is supporting foodbanks in Stoke-on-Trent. <br><br>Unfortunately, foodbanks have become invaluable resources in modern Britain. There were 4.3&nbsp;million children living in poverty in the UK in 2019-20. That's 31&nbsp;per cent of children, or nine&nbsp;in a classroom of 30. <br><br>Work does not provide a guaranteed route out of poverty in the UK. 75&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;of children growing up in poverty live in a household where at least one person works. Often these people don’t have many people sticking up for them. It took a Premier League footballer to hold politicians to account for their failures in feeding the poorest children.  <br><br>In a year where families felt the effects of the pandemic in their livelihoods, we are reminded about the extent of the problem, and the role foodbanks play in helping those who need that help. This is the case in Stoke-on-Trent. <br><br>Last year we raised an incredible £6,000. We’re not aiming to beat that this year - in fact - we’re not thinking in terms of targets. We’re just asking - if it’s at all possible to spare it - if folk could donate what they can to support this vital service. <br><br>Vis Unita Fortior.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p><br><span>*Statistics: Child Poverty Action Group</span><br><br><br></p>",107,107,"2021-12-25 10/2021-12-24 10/2021-12-24 10/2021-12-24 50/2021-12-24 30/2021-12-23 10/2021-12-23 5/2021-12-23 25/2021-12-23 10/2021-12-23 20/2021-12-23 10/2021-12-23 27/2021-12-23 17/2021-12-23 20/2021-12-23 10/2021-12-23 20/2021-12-23 10/2021-12-23 20/2021-12-23 30/2021-12-23 10/2021-12-21 30/2021-12-21 10/2021-12-19 30/2021-12-18 15/2021-12-14 30/2021-12-14 20/2021-12-12 20/2021-12-11 100/2021-12-11 20/2021-12-10 10/2021-12-09 20/2021-12-08 50/2021-12-08 10/2021-12-08 10/2021-12-07 20/2021-12-06 20/2021-12-06 10/2021-12-06 20/2021-12-06 20/2021-12-04 50/2021-12-04 10/2021-12-04 10/2021-12-04 100/2021-12-04 213/2021-12-04 20/2021-12-04 50/2021-12-04 10/2021-12-04 10/2021-12-03 10/2021-12-01 50/2021-12-01 10/2021-11-30 15/2021-11-30 5/2021-11-30 20/2021-11-30 10/2021-11-30 10/2021-11-29 20/2021-11-27 10/2021-11-27 10/2021-11-27 10/2021-11-26 10/2021-11-26 20/2021-11-26 10/2021-11-26 20/2021-11-26 30/2021-11-26 20/2021-11-26 30/2021-11-25 20/2021-11-24 20/2021-11-24 20/2021-11-23 20/2021-11-23 20/2021-11-23 15/2021-11-23 5/2021-11-23 500/2021-11-23 10/2021-11-22 10/2021-11-22 5/2021-11-22 20/2021-11-22 20/2021-11-22 30/2021-11-22 30/2021-11-22 20/2021-11-22 50/2021-11-22 20/2021-11-22 30/2021-11-22 20/2021-11-22 100/2021-11-22 10/2021-11-21 35/2021-11-21 50/2021-11-21 50/2021-11-21 30/2021-11-21 50/2021-11-21 10/2021-11-21 10/2021-11-21 10",https://www.justgiving.com/WizardsofDrivel2021,2021-12-25,3129,500,"The Wizards of Drivel - Christmas Appeal 2021"

This year is different in so many ways but the kids have had enough taken from them. Lets keep the joy alive by decorating our houses as normal and also displaying a poster. Rather than trick or treating and giving out sweets, children can try and spot as many posters in windows/porches etc as possible. Our families remain safe and the children have a spooky trail to follow. How many posters will they spot? Plus, we can donate the money we would spend on sweets and treats to help those that have suffered during this difficult time. Win-win!</p><p>I have created the poster in black and white so that it can be coloured in by your little pumpkins (or yourself)!

Only two months ago we were living comfortably as a family of four with two full time working incomes, now we are relying on benefits and support from our family to get by. This has made me realise just how quickly things can turn and that so many just now don't have the option of any support. Food banks are so important for so many families not just during this pandemic but every single day. I would love to do some door step portraits for families to capture this unique time.

Open to all ages.</p><p>Or join us for part of the river walk, drive to Hailes Castle and then walk along the river to Amisfield walled Garden. This is just under 5 miles long and a stunning walk. Open to all ages.</p><p>For those wishing to experience the full walk, it is a breathtaking 12-mile round trip walk from Amisfield Walled Garden Carpark to Traprain along the river Tyne, passing by Sandy's Mill, Hailes Castle, Hailes Mill and then ascend Traprain Law and back again. This is a scenic yet challenging walk with Traprain Law boasting some of the best views of all of East Lothian, Edinburgh, the Lammermuirs and Fife. This route is for those over 18 only.</p><p>We are endeavouring to raise as much money as possible for the East Lothian Foodbank. We understand that this is a true lifeline for others in times of need. Food is vital for not only our physical but our mental wellbeing. A simple act of walking can help us help others, whilst improving our own mental, physical and social wellbeing.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>The event is free to all ages</b>, however, any donations will be gratefully received by the East Lothian Foodbank.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>The full and part walking routes will start at 8 am, please register for an earlier time slot if you believe you will need more time to complete your chosen route.&nbsp;</span><b>To limit the number of participants at one stage of the route at any one time, the walk start times are staggered.</b></p><p><span>We are thrilled that Amisfield Walled Garden will be open to participants and their friends and family from 1-5 pm at the end of their chosen route to celebrate their achievement.

So please bring your own cup for refreshments and picnic blankets.&nbsp;</b><br></p><p><span>This is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate everything great about our community. We walk, donate, create zero waste, care for our environment and give to those in their time of need. Humans need sustenance to survive and with over 18,000 kgs of food being distributed last year, this could be your opportunity to give a little.</span></p><p><span>The full 12 Mile route is only open to those over 18 years of age, the part route and Amisfield Walled Garden are open to all ages and levels of fitness.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>We have limited spaces for participation in the walk so quick sign up on the Eventbrite page is recommended, however, it would be lovely to see lots of supporters back in the garden.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>As it is a zero-waste event there are no medals or tee shirts, you can, however, buy a Wander4Wellbeing hoodie following the completion of the event for £40 which must be ordered and paid for in advance if you wish.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>All participants will undertake their own training prior to this event and on the day participate at their own risk and liability.</b></p><p>Thank you in advance for your interest, donations and ultimately attendance in any form.

We are delighted to hit our initial target of £500 so quickly and have now increased this to £1000! In terms of progress, we have completed grade 2 and 3 exams (waiting for the results from ABRSM) and are now working on grade 4 repertoire. If we complete the challenge earlier than planned, we will attempt to go up to grade 6 by December! We will continue to update you as we go along in the coming months. Please do continue to check out our progress @shrewsburyhighschoolmusic on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><span>Mr Deakin and Mr Bunn are the Senior and Junior Directors of Music at Shrewsbury High School, GDST. One cold December evening late in 2020, they said to each other: ""how cool would it be to learn a brand new instrument from scratch and try and get to say...grade 5 or 6 in a year?! We could set a challenge and do some fundraising!""</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Mr Bunn has been keen to learn the clarinet for many years, as other members of his family also play this instrument. For Mr Deakin, it has been a life-long dream to learn how to play the cello as it is one of the most beautiful instruments. But then he realised that he didn't want to have to carry a huge case around everywhere, so he decided to learn the violin instead...</span><br></p><p><span>...&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>Anyway, after 6 weeks of scratching/scraping/squeaking/squawking our way through our new challenge (whilst both slightly regretting those optimistic words, said after 17 cups of coffee on a long day of recording for Carol Service 2020), we are both preparing to take our grade 2 exams in March 2021! We are aiming to achieve grade 5 on our new instruments by the end of the calendar year, in the winter exam season sometime in December. As well as this being a personal challenge, we are raising money for Shrewsbury Food Bank at&nbsp;<span>Barnabas Church Centre, Shrewsbury SY3 7DN, to try and help some of the most vulnerable members in our community during Christmas 2021.

Were runners compete to run 100 miles through the mountains with a cut off of 24hrs.Then I had a crazy idea that I could run 100 miles in one go in 24 hrs and that is how I come up with the couch 100 miles in 12 months. Then being a Christian I had wanted to do a pilgrimage and got the idea to run the St Chad's way 92 miles from Chester cathedral to Lichfield and then home again.&nbsp;</p><p>I chose Cannock food bank as the charity to do my Crazy scheme due to the important work that they do. I know first hand as I've been a volunteer in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>So please give it must be worth a pound 👍</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",10,10,"2022-01-23 20/2022-01-05 40/2022-01-03 10/2022-01-02 20/2022-01-02 10/2022-01-02 30/2022-01-02 20/2021-04-08 5/2021-04-08 5/2021-04-08 10",https://www.justgiving.com/Richard-Wilcox3,2022-01-23,170,250,"Wils A5 Challenge Running 102 along A5 miles Capel Curig to Cannock"

Our local foodbanks do an amazing job for those in need. we As a family wanted to give up something we love, something that would impact on our enjoyment. We are not big drinkers, we don’t smoke. However, we do absolutely love chocolate, cake, sweets and treats (especially the twins). Therefore we are going totally sugar free for January to raise money for our local foodbank. January is a hard time for many families, not just the ones out of work, even working families are using our foodbanks. So donate to our page please. Let’s make a difference. We will keep you updated with our progress along the way. I’m super proud of the twins for agreeing to this, although I don’t think they really realise that sugar is everywhere 🤣🤣🤣</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
