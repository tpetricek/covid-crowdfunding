We live in a nation where more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. The Trussell Trust has given out over 1.6 million packs of food supplies in the past year alone. Food Banks are not just a place to pick up essential sustenance  with cuts to community centres and frontline services they have also become mini-welfare and advice centres.    We're aiming to raise £5000 before Christmas 2019  which will go to the Trussell Trust. Your donation will directly help those most in need of support. It is vital that those working in publishing come together as a community and take action.    It is important to help those in greatest need but solutions must also be found to the reasons people find themselves in need of food banks.    The Trussell Trust’s CEO Emma Revie has indicated that the benefits system has been driving a rise in foodbank use– the charity released their State of Hunger 2019 report in November.    “This is the busiest six months we’ve ever seen – more people than ever before are being forced to foodbanks’ doors ” said Revie. “Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty  but currently thousands of women  men and children are not receiving sufficient protection from destitution. This is not right. But we know this situation can be fixed – our benefits system could be the key to unlocking people from poverty. We need to put money back into the pockets of people who most need our support. It’s in our power as a country to end the need for foodbanks. This can change.”        Thank you for your support.

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.

A total of 846 000 emergency food parcels will need to be provided by the Trussell Trust Food Banks network to people in crisis during October to December 2020. This is a 61% increase on last year.    Illness  disability  family breakdown  and job losses are just some of the reasons why staying above water is a struggle for millions of people. Coronavirus has exacerbated all of these issues  and the UK is now facing record high rates of unemployment and job losses. 32% of families have lost income as a result of Covid-19.    An additional 670 000 people will be destitute by the end of the year  meaning they cannot afford essentials like housing  energy  and food. Over 50% of people using food banks in the Food Banks network at the start of the pandemic had never needed one before. Families have been the hardest hit  accounting for nearly two in five households needing to use a food bank.     On 21st November a group of us will run and walk 21km along the Thames from Putney Bridge to Greenwich Park. This is half a kilometer for every hundred thousand children in poverty in the UK. We will be participating in small groups with members from our household and/or support bubble  maintaining 2 meters from others  to comply with current national lockdown restrictions.    We know that times are tight for everyone  but this is an idea of how far your money can go:  £10 could help give a parent peace of mind that their family will not go hungry tonight.  £20 could help support someone take their first steps out of poverty.    Why the Trussell Trust? As well as providing emergency food packages to the most vulnerable in our communities  the Trust provides practical and holistic support to help people resolve the crises that they face.     The Trussell Trust is also dedicated to creating positive change in the UK. In 2019 10% of their expenditure was on advocacy.

It is more important than ever that we work together to support one another. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund has launched to provide support to those most at need in our community. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund Right now many of us are understandably feeling anxious and vulnerable  but there are many among us that need immediate support in order to ensure that they can have access to food. Greenwich residents have a proud history of looking after one another - and never has this been more important than now. So I have been working with Greenwich Food Bank to create the Greenwich Food Bank Fund. As the borough faces one of its most important challenges in living memory  the Fund has been set up to ensure that those in need across the borough have access to the help they need. Please  even during this most difficult of times  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Greenwich. Please be assured that even the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference. Thank you for your generosity. FAQs Where will the funds go? The funds will go directly to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by the Greenwich Food Bank and delivered to food banks across the borough  from Blackheath to Eltham  Kidbrooke  Thamesmead and beyond. A full list of food bank locations is available at https://greenwich.foodbank.org.uk/locations/. If I donate will it go directly to those who need it? Yes  your donation will go directly to Greenwich Food Bank. Unlike some other platforms  GoFundMe does not charge a fundraising fee although it takes a small transaction fee. See https://www.gofundme.com/c/free-fundraising for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to. Will the money be spent in Greenwich? Yes. Is there anything else I can do? The most immediate need is to raise finance  so that purchasing can continue. However there is also a need to: (1) donate food where possible; and (2) create a team of delivery drivers as the Food Bank moves to a delivery model.

She needed her broken leg amputated  and is currently resting up and recuperating. Thanks to our amazing donors  her vet fees were all paid for  and we have a little left over which we're going to reallocate to other needy cats via charities and our local food banks  as we always promised we would. Thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  to every single donor.     If you have a little extra to spare  please consider your local cat charity. <3     When I moved into my house I noticed a stray cat that lived in the bins. It was nervous  unfriendly and didn't belong to anyone. I called it Gary the Garbage cat.       I spoke to neighbours and put up Facebook posts trying to figure out whether Gary had an owner  with no luck. I'd put out wet food for Gary to eat  and over time Gary started following me home for dinner. Last month we hit a milestone: scritches  purrs and mutual miaowing. Gary still lived in the bins  or chimney flues of the shops by my house  but came to the yard for dinner.    A few weeks ago my boyfriend  Alex  saw some teenagers trying to kick Gary and chased them off  and his car has since been vandalised. We couldn't take Gary in and risk giving our own cats illnesses  so we bought Gary a little house for the garden and sought veterinary help. The charity Cats in Distress offered to pay for a visit to the vet.       The first visit never happened because Gary escaped while under the care of the rescue (wily minx) but we were reunited  and I set about giving Gary a bit of a clean up. At this point I was able to conclude...    Gary is a girl.        The newly-renamed Martha got a vet appointment rescheduled  and at the time we hoped it would just be a check up where we could assess her overall health  check her gungy eyes and look for a microchip.     However  last night  things took a turn.       Alex called me to say that Martha was walking with a limp  which hadn't happened before. I rushed home and picked her up to bring her in. The left paw was limp and she didn't want to put weight on it. I called the charity  who said to keep her safe and warm and wait for the appointment in the morning  but said that if Martha was injured they didn't have the funds to cover it. I was prepared  but hopeful that it was a sprain.    This morning we went to the vet  and the news was... well  it was bad.      Martha has broken teeth  a sore side and trauma to her face. She also has a suspected broken shoulder.    The vet said all of these injuries point to being kicked in the face.     The best case scenario for Martha is a mild fracture or dislocation. The worst case scenario is that we can't afford to treat the leg  and we all know what that means. She is about 4 or 5 and I am not ready to give up on her.    She is so affectionate and calm  even with this horrible injury. I need all the help I can get to literally get her back on her feet.    Any donations you can spare will go to Martha's vet fees and ongoing care. We don't know yet what she'll need  but the x-ray alone is going to cost £350  at best. That's assuming she will sit still under sedation and only needs two pictures taken.        In the unlikely  miraculous event that we raise more money than she needs for this injury we'll set up a fund for her ongoing care because she will now be completely uninsurable. Anything left over after that will be re-donated to other cats in need.     Please help us help Martha. She deserves better than the life she's had so far  and I can't afford to put it right on my own.     If you want to read more about Martha  you can catch up with the Twitter thread about her.",False

In 2020  there are around 4 million children living in poverty. That’s 30 percent of ALL children and 9 in a classroom of 30.     Can you imagine those children waking up with no presents in their stocking or under the tree. Children don’t have the capacity to understand poverty. They might know that their parents don’t have much money but they could equally think that Santa did not visit them this year. How devastating ! We would like you all to open your eyes and your hearts to understand poverty is real! But we can all do something to help those children ( and their parents) to wake up and feel the joy of Christmas  just like all the other children across the country. The Winter Toy Appeal was set and run by the Local Buyers Club in Hackney seven years ago to ensure that children in poverty across North and East London have a special gift to open at Christmas. They collect new toys only and give them out via a network of schools  children’s centres  social workers  temporary accommodation services  hostels  refuges and food banks to children in most need. The toys are passed on to parents so they have the joy of giving and in that way the appeal takes away the stress of them needing to save for a gift. Last year’s appeal reached more than 4 000 children in Hackney  Islington  Tower Hamlets and Haringey. Due to the pandemic  this appeal has been so much harder because shops are closed and lock down means it’s harder to reach those children. We are therefore asking you all to donate to our gofundme as little or as much as you can to give to this cause. Once the money is collected  we will use the money to buy presents for different age ranges and development stages to provide to this fund and ensure that children who are living in poverty in north london have presents to open at Christmas.

There has also been £4 000 of support released to Framework to enable them to purchase essential items to the Homeless community in Nottingham. This included  but was not limited to  the provision of items such as mobile phones so that they can remain in contact with key workers and minimise the chance of these individuals being unable to stick to the government guidelines on social distancing.

This funding enabled them to purchase essential items including food and toiletries.      Disability Groups (£2 500)      With social distancing measures causing increased issues for the disability community in Nottingham  this support has enabled the Disability Support Nottingham organisation to increase its capability to provide phone support - in addition to welfare checks - to those in need.

Diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer in the lungs and bones.        Thank you for choosing to read this page.  I don't quiet know where to start  however I know I need to start  for my lovely mum.    Those of you who know Andrea will know she is an extremely kind  caring  funny and positive person  who works as a self employed psychotherapist and counsellor. Those of you who know us  will know me and my mum have always been the best of friends and are extremely close  so this news saddens me deeply.     My beautiful mum was diagnosed with Cancer for the very first time in 2006 when I was just 7 years old. This was Skin Cancer  she had to battle it and work at the same time  such a hard thing for a single mum with two young kids  but after treatment and ops at Christie's Cancer Centre she bravely recovered.     Only to be diagnosed again in 2015 with Breast Cancer Stage 2 a very difficult time for us all  I remember the difficulty  going through my GCSE's whilst caring for my mum physically and emotionally. Financially this time was challenging for us as a family  as my mum has always worked so hard to provide for my brother and I  without any financial support from fathers. When she was diagnosed  the ops and treatment on top of the emotional pain made it so she really struggled to work  but had no other choice. The financial strain was one of the most stressful elements of her illness  and this really shouldn't be the case when you're facing a life threatening illness. We accessed food banks to eat and didn't get to enjoy pleasurable things that normal families do  instead I remember having to spend my wages from my part time job on food for our family. This was an embarrassing time for my mum as a mother works all her life to provide for her family but Cancer takes this right away  she tried so hard  never once giving up or asking anyone for anything.     My mum has always been a big believer in spiritual  holistic and alternative therapies  so she chose not to take the Chemotherapy which the doctors strongly advised claiming she wouldn't live more than a few years if it was not taken. She braved this and stayed true to her beliefs and used holistic  complementary therapies and PMA. Thankfully she was given the all clear from Breast Cancer and she started working as a therapist after completing her degree whilst fighting the cancer  and has never looked back since  she has been nothing less than completely dedicated to her job and gives her all to her clients  ensuring they feel fully supported and cared for.    Those of you who know Andrea for whatever reason she may have come in to your life  I'm sure everyone has the same view of her - a beautiful  selfless  generous and truly strong  inspiring woman. A woman who remains so positive and selfless regardless of what life throws at her.    Jubba  my mums younger sister passed away of Cancer in November  my mum received her unfortunate results on just 2 weeks after. Therefore it is even more of a difficult time for her  and all the family.    My mum first lost her voice last in November 2017. After undergoing investigations she discovered half her vocal cords have become paralysed. This means  if you haven't heard her  her voice is barely a whisper and has been like this for over a year. This has made her job as a counsellor very strenuous. Just before this Christmas  in November 2018 mums year long investigations (biopsy)showed cancerous cell changes in the lungs and that the canceous cells from the Breast Cancer had spread and there is now cancer in the sternum (breast bone) and lower spine  as well as other scattered locations around the body. My mum  my brother and I sat through the dreaded meeting with the cancer specialists on 4th Jan 2019 which we had been thinking of all Christmas  to be told that mums now has Secondary breast cancer which is metastatic and in the lungs and bones. We tried to remain calm however to be told that the cancer is Stage 4 and if treatment is taken then life expectancy is on average 2 years but 5 years at maximum. I struggled to hold it together and broke down in tears. The thought of loosing my only parent and absolute best friend  who has worked so hard all her life to be such a good mum to me  at this young age devastates me.     The doctors spent hours emphasising the severity of this Cancer  and how essential treatment is  and fast. My mum was advised to take a high dosage of IV chemotherapy 2 years intense at Christies Cancer Centre however  she has always been very resistant to such strong conventional medicine and made clear that if she was going to be given 2 years to live  she'd rather live these years to the fullest and not ill  bedbound from such harsh treatment. We have decided as a family and with the doctors for my mum to start treatment which consists of a little less intense Chemotherapy and a specialised medicine herceptin this Friday 11th Jan which she has to take every 2 weeks and go to the hospital every 3 weeks.     Being a single mum she has a lot on her plate  the side effects of this treatment will really rid my mum of her ability to function as normal  and will even make daily tasks a challenge nevermind her full time work as a therapist. Such as breathlessness  dizziness  bruising  stinging  arthalgia  myaliga  insomnia  jaw pain  increased risk of serious infection  lethargy  sore mouth  nausea and vomiting  heartburn and serious energy loss. As you can imagine  trying to hold a full time job down which is essential to live and pay bills would be incredibly hard and virtually impossible.    SO I've decided to set up this page  without my mums awareness to help alleviate some of the constant stress that shouldn't be her main worry when suffering a life threatening terminal cancer.     The generous donations will be spent on things like mums transport to and from hospital (as she doesn't drive). I am hoping that your kind donations will be able to enable my mum to not have to burn herself out and work  as much as she loves her job  it is detrimental to her health  it kills me seeing her so emotionally and physically exhausted  without any other option. **Since donations have been so generous I am really encouraging my Mum to see less clients and spend her energy on her own health  but this is fully dependent on your generous donations  so thank you so much.**    The money will enable my mum to explore alternative therapies and treatment such as holistic treatment which is never funded by the NHS (I know she has a list of many things she'd like to try but simply can't afford). Complementary therapies  counselling so that she can discuss the pain and fear this painful news brings. My mum also used to attend yoga classes but she recently had to finish as she told me she has to cut out luxuries due to money being limited and only based on how much she can work  so I would love her to be able to afford these classes again to help her health. And lastly  the money would go towards trying to find anything she can to help  I know she'd love to eat nutritious healthy foods that will help build her immune system and fight.     Andrea is and always has been the most generous and selfless person  you won't catch her being able to receive gifts or money very easily at all  however she'll easily give you her favourite ring or jumper if she thinks it suits you and you like it! She wont think twice about dropping everything to be there for you if you need someone. And she's never changed.     *Due to such devastating news I have chosen to leave my degree at the University of York and come home to care for my lovely Mum  so do message me if you have any ideas or ways you could help support.*    I will be looking to put on a fundraising event to raise money for my Mum so please do be in touch if you can help/have ideas.     I appreciate you taking time to read this and any donation no matter how small will honestly be so appreciated.    Love  Grace x      ",False

Their neighbour  who is a Leicester City Council tenant  had been using portable generators and it was one of these that had caught on fire which spread to Iqbal's home.     At home at the time were Iqbal's wife and four daughters aged 5-15yrs. Iqbal was at work when the fire broke out and rushed home as soon as he had heard what had happened.       The fire spread into Iqbal's home and the family was forced to evacuate into emergency accommodation. Unfortunately  the family did not settle well into the accommodation due to the overcrowding and stress the family was under. They left the emergency accommodation the following day due to stress and anxiety.      The family stayed with relatives for a couple of weeks in a one bed flat. They knew this was unsustainable with their large family however at least they felt safe. LCC informed their relative that the family couldn't stay any longer due to overcrowding and the family was forced to move out the following day.      The family sofa surfed for a few weeks until they were able to find a vacant property that they could just about afford to rent. The property they found needed a lot of work doing to it and Iqbal put his DIY skills to good use fixing up the property in return for reduced rent. However  it was still 4 months until the family managed to get hot water  heaters and to this day there is still no insulation in the walls.      The effect this has had on Iqbal's family is immense and the young children have been deeply affected by the trauma and chaotic living arrangements  overcrowding and lack of basic services. Iqbals eldest daughter is going through her GCSEs and this whole ordeal has really knocked her confidence and prevented her from focusing on her studies. Iqbals' eldest daughter has been diagnosed with psoriasis and her hair is falling out  doctors' have said this is a direct result of the stress of the fire and the subsequent house moves. The other children are also affected in many different ways.      As Iqbal's home was a private property which unfortunately had no insurance at the time the family is stuck in a real situation where they are unable to buy another home. Leicester City Council has offered to buy the land at less than a third of the market value as long as the family can raise the selling fees. Iqbal is still paying the mortgage and has no additional income or savings to cover the costs of repairs which have been estimated to be £35 000. The house that the fire originated in has now been fully repaired and refurbished by Leicester City Council  yet Iqbal's home is still in ruins and uninhabitable.      Iqbal and his family have been visiting a local food bank at E2 in Beaumont Leys to help them through their situation and have been knocked from pillar to post in their attempts to get this resolved with Leicester City Council which has recently come to a dead end.       If Iqbal was able to raise £35 000 it would mean that his family could get the repairs completed and move back into their home and their children can return to a sense of normality.  ",False

The Club itself is considering a number of online fundraising ideas and as a Member of 10 years plus (as well as being a Member some 20 years ago) I thought to myself what can I do to help ?     All Rotary Clubs are a part of an International grouping of volunteers who give up some of their time to raise funds for and take part in projects designed to help and assist the local communities and internationally.    Bodmin in Cornwall is a charming (former) market town with an active (but ageing !} Rotary Club of 27 Members who raise funds and  in normal times  participate in numerous activities. These are many and varied and include supporting the local food bank and memory cafe as well as assisting young people both educationally and in social development. The Club also supports local fundraising activities of charities such as MNDA  Hospital League of Friends as well as supporting Shelterbox. Internationally numerous other activities have recently included the refurbishment and delivery of a fire appliance to a remote settlement in Albania.    As one clearly in the old fool category I'm not fit enough to run up and down stairs a million times or unaware enough to scoff 200 pancakes in one go (possibly not even a tempting thought) so I looked for a way to help the Club within my capabilities. I live in Bodmin with my wife Carol and have for the last 40 years or so (with the exception of a few days) sported a beard. Since lockdown the relatively manicured hair has grown into a luxuriant beard of which I am quite proud and I thought I could possibly with your help raise some funds for the Rotary Club by having it removed...    My wife is not so keen as she has persistently maintained I would have a facial similarity to a Chipmunk without it ! Hey ho....being of a repressed devil may care personality I thought I'd be a brave Chipmunk and have a sponsored beard shave with all proceeds going to Bodmin Rotary and I'm hoping to raise at least £250 (or as much as possible) to part with Santas pride and joy…....    I feel passionately that local community volunteer organisations are increasingly important in this changing and challenging world and I hope you will feel able to support me in my effort.    I intend to be 'de-Santa' on 5th August and would welcome your sponsorship if only to be able to witness how like a Chipmunk I really am!

I had originally thought we would make 200 face shields  which we would have funded as a school  but there is quite clearly a much greater need  so I have set us the ambitious task of making 1 000 pieces. As you can imagine  this comes with a significant cost implication  despite the masks working out at about £1 each. I have had parents of our wonderful students contacting me and asking of they can contribute towards this project  so I felt it would be helpful to set up this GoFundMe page to help us achieve our mission. As I said earlier  we have the available equipment and skilled staff on site  the willing volunteers (who have already been amazing) and the contacts for additional materials  so our only limiting factor is the financing of the project.

We are asking you to help us  by donating what you can to this crowdfund  and joining us on 22 August for an evening of pride  performance and love for Beirut  its people and its reconstruction. Rebuilding Beirut with Pride will be hosted at the Bell Pub in Whitechapel  and live-streamed all night for everyone to watch and take part in. From an art auction to a programme of performance  we want to celebrate Arab and queer art and talent and help rebuild our hometown in the process. Click here to buy your tickets for the event.    Where is the money going?    All proceeds will be equally split and donated to the Lebanese Red Cross  Beit El Baraka   Basmeh & Zeitooneh and Embrace Lebanon   as well as two grassroots LGBT+ crowdfunds  detailed below.     Beit El Baraka provide food banks for victims of the disaster  Basmeh & Zeitooneh are responding on the ground to those who have been made homeless  and Embrace Lebanon offers mental health support.     The NGOs were chosen after having direct discussions with several people within Lebanon itself who informed us of which organisations are trustworthy and are not affiliated with government authorities in any way  to ensure the money is directly going to support those in need first and foremost.    We have also identified two crowdfunds that have been strongly recommended to us by many members of Beirut's LGBTQ+ community  in that they are offering on-the-ground and direct support and are being led by trusted community members.     These crowdfunds are Disaster Relief for Lebanese Transgender Community   led by Lebanese trans pioneer Sasha Elijah  and Funds for LGBTQ Victims of Beirut Explosion   led by prominent community member Sandra Melhem.    The total sum raised will be split 6-way between these 6 beneficiaries  and receipts of these donations will be posted here for completely transparency.     Why are we fundraising?     Beirut is a disaster zone. On the 4th of August  the city was rocked by a colossal explosion involving 2 750 tons of ammonium nitrate. To put things in perspective  it is one of the worse urban explosions since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The blast killed at least 157 people and injured 5 000. Hundreds remain missing. With the force of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake  the explosion's shock wave enveloped Beirut  shattering windows and collapsing old buildings. Lebanon's hospitals - already overrun by coronavirus - are in dire need of support. Meanwhile  around 300 000 people have been displaced from their homes. Two of Beirut's LGBTQ+ hubs  Mar Mikhael and Gemmayze  were only 500m away from the point of detonation. These areas have been utterly devastated and  like many other parts of Beirut  are now uninhabitable.    The blast comes at the worse time for Lebanon  hitting a country already in disaster. Covid-19 exacerbated a pre-existing political and economic crisis  bringing the Lebanese to the brink of collapse. This year has seen thousands of Lebanese lose their lifetime savings and the country's hyper-inflated currency remains in free-fall. One in the three people are unemployed  while amongst Lebanon's poorest  famine is approaching. In short  your donations are needed. They will support those people immediately impacted by the explosion  but also Lebanese communities and families facing economic desolation. Please see below for which NGOs and groups we are donating to.    What's happening on the 22nd?     While we encourage you support us  share this page and ask all your friends to donate throughout the next two weeks  we have an exciting day planned to drum up even more donations!

We urgently need your help to pay for the food costs. Any money you can give will be a fantastic gesture to support people most at need now.     Harissa Kitchen  part of the Newcastle upon Tyne based Food Nation social enterprise CIC (03169228)  is launching a free meals service for vulnerable people living in Byker  Walker  Sandyford  Ouseburn and Heaton  coordinated through the Newcastle City Council’s Citylife Line service to ensure the people most at need get the help.     All vulnerable people in the household will receive 6 days food each week  delivered on Monday  Wednesday and Friday consisting of a breakfast pot  soup and an evening meal. Weekends will also see a special treat of a cake added to the meal. We are expecting to initially serve up 540 free meals a week – and will look to expand this to 900 each week as referrals come through. We are anticipating providing at least 9 900 free meals to people that need the most help over the next three months.    The following people will be provided with support:    · Older people living alone with no other support network; who can’t leave the house due to mobility issues or are self-isolating due to health conditions but haven’t been sent an NHS letter and therefore not eligible for emergency food parcels; or who have no access to internet or cannot order online.  · Families who are self-isolating with virus symptoms with no other support system  have low or no income or can’t get a delivery slot for food.    Some people are in need of ongoing help whilst others need one-off support whilst waiting for delivery slots with supermarkets or for newly unemployed to receive benefits. No one else is offering this support to these isolated people at this scale.     The food is being prepared by trained chefs for free and will provide a varied and nutritionally balanced meals. Food will be delivered by volunteers in re-heatable containers. All food preparation and delivery will fully comply with the Government’s Covid-19 food and safety and working standards.    We are looking for funding to pay for food and volunteer travel costs. The cost for providing this service is £5 a day for one person. Food Nation receives some grant support from Newcastle City Council  but this will not cover the cost of the food or delivery. Volunteer drivers where needed will be able to claim 45p a mile expenses. Where possible we are sourcing reduced cost or donation food to reduce costs.     The cost of providing the food over 3 months is £16 500. We are also applying to local grant funders for help - but this takes time and people need our help now. The more money we raise  the more people we can help.     Food Nation is a well-respected social enterprise (CIC 03169228) that has been working with families and some of the poorest communities in Newcastle upon Tyne  helping them to make healthy food choices and improve their wellbeing. As part of this – we have run a popular community restaurant Harissa Kitchen serving great quality and nutritionally balanced food  whose profits went back into supporting our wider work. Due to the coronavirus situation  we can no longer keep our restaurant open and our premises are not suitable for takeaways.    Please donate to help as we’ve started to receive urgent referrals now. We know times are hard for everyone – but for the people we will support it will really be a lifeline.    · £5 will pay for a days food for a vulnerable person  · £30 will pay for a weeks food for one person    The people identified have no support networks to help them  and are struggling now. This service will provide a much needed short term lifeline. Requests already received include:    - 'I'm visually impaired and autistic. I also have depression  anxiety and Diabetes Type 2. I'm having difficulties getting medication and food and can't get an online delivery slot.'  - 'Me and my 9yr old daughter both have symptoms of COVID 19 and need to self isolate. I need help to get food. I have financial difficulties and am struggling to manage as my next Universal Credit isn't due until 14th April. I don't have enough money to pay for my gas and electric.'  'She has no food at home and has a young daughter and I feel she needs priority. She does not receive any benefits and relies solely on food banks.'    Food Nation are also providing a ‘Food Nation Friend’ befriending service for isolated people and food shopping service for people who can cook but cannot leave the house. They are also linking people into wider support and ensuring they have access to advice and support networks to combat isolation including their newly remodelled Virtual Tuesday Lunch Club.

Yesterday 319 TORIES VOTED AGAINST FREE SCHOOL MEALS The tories wasted 12 billion pounds on a track and trace app that doesn’t even work  YET they apparently do not have the money to feed our poorest children  especially through the toughest winter EVER in the history of the UK.

No child should go to sleep on an empty stomach  worrying about if their parents will be able to feed them tomorrow just like no parent should have to choose between not paying the electricity or water bill in order to feed their child a meal and even then probably starve themselves.

Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to us.       OUR PROJECT IS TO FEED THE NIGHT SHIFT STAFF ON ITU WARDS    WHO WE ARE     We are Joe and Annabelle Colairo and  together with our family  we run a Cafe and Outside Catering company called Masters on Blackfriars Road  London. This is now closed  except for the kitchens  but check us out @ www.masterscatering.co.uk& on instagram @ masterscatering_london      THE PROBLEM      A consultant at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital told us that ""frontline staff were having a terrible and stressful time  working 12-14 hour shifts with no food available to them. The canteens are closed at night. The frontline staff  many of whom live alone  some of whom have to go to food banks  are exhausted after their long shifts "".          (Quotes from Alison Hulme’s texts - she is the Consultant paediatric surgeon who alerted us to this problem.)        “The IT Nurses are most at risk - poor things. I think they are having a gruelling time and so shopping and cooking is just too much for them when they are so low  both physically and emotionally”      “There is no time during shifts for a break  but a meal before or after would be hugely appreciated.”        THE SOLUTION      We specialise in supplying freshly cooked  nutritious and delicious meals. Joe is up at 4 in the morning  sourcing the best produce in New Covent Garden Market.      Since the 28th March  our chefs Sergio  Luis & Cesar have generously and freely volunteered to provide between 40 and 60 hot meals to frontline staff at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and The Royal London Hospital  Mile End.        WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP      Unfortunately we can’t sustain the cost of the food and packaging on our own any longer  and that’s why we need you.      You can be sure that your gift is well spent and it reaches the people most at risk and need.      * We are working on a NOT-FOR-PROFIT basis  * We have all the health  safety and 5* Hygiene certificates  * We know our nutritious meals will help keep the nurses healthier  * We know they will go directly to the nurses who need them most  those on the frontline  * Delivery is arranged by The Chelsham Road Community Association  who have Alison Hulme  a consultant paediatric surgeon  making sure it is delivered directly to the now expanded ITU unit. It goes in at 9pm.  * They also deliver treats  vitamin shots  fresh fruit and also much needed Organic Juice from PIPORGANIC.COM which is being supplied totally for free. The PPE kit is like wearing a plastic bag and dehydration is a problem for the nurses wearing it  * There are no middle men or large corporations taking a cut as with some other organisations  * The cost per meal is £3.50       PLEASE DONATE AND HELP US TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE CARING FOR US      In our experience  there are many donations for frontline staff working during the day  but not for those working at night. Where there are donations of food to the night shift staff  they never make it to them; and that's why we need your help.      “ Someone delivered 15 Pizzas 2 days ago and left them at reception. By the time they got to ITU there were only 2! “      WE KNOW OUR MEALS GET DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO ITU. ( By volunteers every night from Chelsham Road)      Here are some testimonials….      “Every day for the past 2 weeks I have collected 40 delicious wholesome  freshly cooked meals  half of which are vegetarian. The offering is wholeheartedly generous  inventive  varied  nutritious and of great quality.   I met one nurse leaving a 14 hour day shift  who had had some of Joe and Annabelle's meals when she was on night duty. She said “ Oh my goodness  I can’t tell you what a lifeline this is. Who are these people who are so amazing? It means so much to us - it makes me want to cry . I’ve been working all day and only finishing now at 9pm means I haven’t been able to eat all day. It’s like a war zone in there. Thank you  thank you  thank you. This is just what we need.” - Janie from Chelsham Road    ""ITU and theatre nurses are very grateful"" - Ben  Consultant     One of the nurses said they were anxious about getting ill and that its a very worrying time for them. They said the food is amazing and it gives them something to look forward to after a tough shift.      * The cost per meal is £3.50. We deliver 7 days a week which is 280 meals each week to Chelsea and we are looking to raise £980 amount per week.   We have the capacity to deliver more meals to different frontline staff in other hospitals if we have the funds and only if we have the direct access with the frontline staff and operating theatre night managers. Your money will go towards meals for those that need it most.       Thank you so much for making this possible.      Yours faithfully    Joe and Annabelle",False

In some areas of the city region  that rises above 50%.  - In the 2019 Indices of Deprivation  Liverpool ranked 2nd in England for highest proportion of neighbourhoods classed among the 10% most deprived nationally.    Food banks really shouldn't have to exist  but we have a government in this country which systematically perpetuates poverty and inequality  so sadly they're an absolute necessity for millions of people to live.

For 4 years  we owned a prominent petrol/gas station in Hillsborough  North Carolina (USA)  until it tragically caught fire in June  2009. Our insurance company did not give us a fair payout. In December  2007 we moved our family to Ghana  Africa to start up a new business and carry out missionary duties. After a series of extreme robberies  we decided to join my husband's side of the family in the United Kingdom to start a new life.      For the past 6 ½ years  the Home Office have denied our family the right to remain and work in the UK several times after arriving on a visitor’s visa.

The post involved me telling a little about my life since losing my wife Michelle.     She was 37yrs old. She died after the flu virus caused a massive cardiac arrest. She died in front of me in Whiston hospital and the A & E team struggled for six minutes to bring her back. They did manage to do so and she survived a further 7 days before a brain scan shown irreparable brain damage and I was told there was nothing could be done for her. We withdrew care on Easter Sunday 2016.     Michelle (like myself) was a primary school teacher. As such  following her death I have recieved a small pension from her. Every month since she passed awaya I try to use some of the money I receive from her pension to help a cause that catches my eye in her memory. These are usually things like friends running marathons  park benches in memory of people who have died or other things that touch me.     This month my son Billy and me decided we should do something about the number of people in our local area who simply do not have enough food in their homes to feed their families. So we used some of the money from Michelle's pension and the money we would have spent on Christmas dinner (as we have been invited to a friends house) to buy all sorts of 'stuff' to give to our local food bank. We bought tinned veg  nappies  sanitary towels  baby wipes and UHT milk. It felt great doing this. Money well spent.     Someone asked me to post 'our efforts' in the group and the response was unbelievable. It seems to have touched the hearts of many people. 4500+ (and climbing) reactions  hundreds of shares. I was amazed. I have had several people send me money via my paypal account and many more ask how they can help. So I thought as I had perhaps unwittingly created a platform to help people out I would ask for that help via a GoFundMe page. I think that's how people do these things now?    One of the emails I had was from someone who sent me £2 with an apology. 'I am sorry it isn't more.' I wrote back to say £2 will never ever 'not be enough'. If £2 is what you can afford to give then £2 is enough. £2 is amazing. £2 could help turn someone's life around. So yep...I am asking for £2. More if you can afford it...less if I am asking too much. My point is...it does not matter how much. What matters is you did.     So there it is. I am not sure how successful this will be but if everyone who reacted to my initial post gave £2 that would double the amount I am trying to raise. To be fair...how much I put in the box isnt a goal. My goal is to raise as much as I can to buy food and other essential items for people who need it. If it's another £2 then that's 4 packets of sanitary towels...if it is another £200 then that is trolleys full of food. £2000 and I think we may be genuinely changing lives. Something everyone could take pride in.     I would ask this one thing though...I would ask that if you do decide to donate to this fund raising that you do not hide your name. I want to know who you are. I want my son to see you. This is as much about helping me in #makingaman out of my boy as it is helping people you don't know eat.

When we were little  growing up in the 90’s  my siblings and I had free school meals  through middle school and high school  and I know how thankful my mum was of these free lunches. We had very little money This was back in the day where very little money meant just that. We didn’t have SKY TV  or mobile phone bills and my mum would go without food so that we could have new clothes and didn’t get bullied at school. These were the days when the supermarkets had a price war on tins of their own brand baked beans Anyone remember that? When they went so low  that at one point they were 1p! Yes 1p! And my mum would take me and my siblings and we would go in separately and purchase 6 tins each (the maximum you were allowed to buy) for a penny each. Because baked beans could really fill out any meal  and was the cheapest thing to buy. I still remember this to this day. ☺️          Some might say  if you can’t afford to feed your kids  then why have them? But right now there are so many families who  6 months ago were absolutely fine. And we know this first hand through work that Aron is involved with alongside the shop. We know that there are families  who have lost their jobs and can’t find a new one. Or families that haven’t had any help from the government through this whole Covid situation. There are families now using food banks because they don’t have enough money to go shopping. This is not a child’s fault. No-one chose for this year to pan out the way it did. And as such we want to help.           Each year  normally at Christmas we do something for the local food banks or food charities. Although this year  our business has been hit super hard with the huge number of postponements of weddings  and the uncertainty of peoples buying habits  we know that our children won’t go hungry this half term. And so we want to give back.           We know we’re a little late  but really it’s never to late to help. We want to donate 15 food parcels  including food for lunches this week as well as some essential foods  to families who are really struggling. So...          If you know a family that are visiting food banks.     If you’re a family that don’t know how you’re going to feed your kids this holiday.     If you’re a teacher who knows of a family who needs a little help          Then please message us privately to arrange collection of a small food parcel. There will be no judgement from anyone here. Parcels will be ready to collect this Monday & Tuesday between 10-4 at the shop.           As much as we’d like to help as many people as we can  unfortunately we need to keep this local  to families in Poole and Bournemouth.

We provide after school food for young people attending Youth First Clubs in Lewisham as well as food parcels for young people and their families from specific schools in Lewisham and Tower Hamlets. We are continuing to support these families in term time and the holidays.     £50 raised will be able to feed 45 children     £100 raised will be able to feed 90 children     £1000 raised will be able to feed 909 children     There is power in our community. Join us.        Why are families experiencing hardship?    Despite the government's U-turn on extending the funding for free school meals over the summer holidays  hundreds of families who needed support were not entitled to the scheme. Young people who used to rely on school breakfast clubs and sports clubs for meals in term-time  and those recently impacted by the financial costs of COVID-19 (which are only increasing)  are more likely to go hungry and become malnourished as school and sports clubs are forced to close or reduce their services over the summer and beyond. This will have both physiological and psychological impacts on the children and their families.     Food Poverty    Child poverty rates in the UK are disgraceful: 700 000 children in London are living in poverty. In Lewisham  37% of children live in poverty and in one ward this is as high as 43.3%. It's deeply distressing that this level of inequality exists in the UK  particularly given that we are one of the richest countries in the world. Don’t know what poverty feels like? See here.    These figures are pre-COVID-19  and it is projected that the number of children in poverty will increase to 5.2 million by 2022. Families from Black  Asian and minority ethnic communities are more likely to live in poverty; which cannot be separated from wider racial injustices and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on the same groups.     A recent survey from theFood Foundation revealed that 14% of UK families with children have experienced food insecurity in the past 6 months.    What are we doing about it?     Legendary Community Club  which was named by Chevrington Odoh from the Pro Plus FC  is a grassroots project set up by some members of Lewisham Mutual Aid and local organisations. Our aim is to deliver emergency food provision to ensure that children do not miss out  for as long as there is a need.     We will make this happen in three ways:    1. Temporary food banks have been set-up for families who require this support during the school holidays  in partnership with local schools and community groups.    2. Kitchens have been set up to prepare nutritionally balanced meals for young people who would normally receive a meal through their local school or sports club.    3. Campaigning and structural change. We know that food charity is not a long term solution. This is not the world we want to live in and we refuse to normalise food banks as a solution to food poverty. This is NOT an inevitable situation.    With this in mind  we have joined forces with The Children's Society  who have been calling on the government to ensure that every local council adequately funds emergency support for families  demanding that nobody is left with nowhere to turn in a time of crisis. For more information about their campaign 'Strengthening the Safety Net' see here  and sign the petition here.    We are also supporting calls from Save the Children and Child Poverty Action Group who have been lobbying for reforms to the benefits system  an increase in the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit by £20  and an end to the two child limit and the £20 000 a year benefit cap which hits families in high-rent areas such as Lewisham particularly hard.     We are working with the Food Foundation who a part of the newly formed alliance who have backed proposals from the National Food Strategy and are working alongside Marcus Rashford to #ENDCHILDFOODPOVERTY    The way our tax and welfare system is designed is a political choice. There aresolutions. We will call on the government and its representatives to be bold  brave and radical in how they approach this problem.     What will we use the funds for?    We will use the money raised from the community to buy food and equipment for the project. We have a host of volunteers  and multiple clubs and schools signed up and ready to go.

The Rev Mandy Brown and her team at Holy Trinity Church in South Street offer practical and emotional comfort and support to those in need.    It cost £28 000 to run the shelter last year. The tight budget means manager David Perry is employed for just 13 hours a week  but he dedicates many more to reaching out to homeless people as soon as the team become aware of their difficulties.    Rev Brown said: ""We are unable to open all year round because the number of volunteers we would need would be phenomenal. We would need a huge amount of money to pay a full-time manager and we just don't have it.""    However  with the help of up to 300 volunteers  they are able to offer a safe haven each night during the worst of the winter for up to 12 guests.    Rev Brown is anxious that the help offered is more than a temporary sticking plaster.    ""Once we open we will keep going to the end of March – we have a very long season  one of the longest [of any winter night shelter] "" she said.    ""Experience tells us that the worst of the bad weather comes later than it used to. But we use that time to be able to work with people and to help people connect and reconnect. We need the time to build up the trust and the love that's required to be able to work with someone.    ""Just providing a roof over somebody's head does not resolve the challenges they are facing. It's just the beginning. The shelter is a conduit to other resources – to housing  to drug and alcohol rehabilitation and even using the contact centre to reconnect people to their children and families "" she said. That support continues even when guests are off the street.    As part of its mission to provide the best possible services  the shelter is regularly inspected by Housing Justice and was rated 'excellent' at the last visit. ""We are very proud of that "" said Rev Brown. ""We work very closely with Housing Justice and we follow all their guidelines.""    Each day  the shelter  now a registered charity  needs two overnight volunteers each night  three lunchtime and four evening helpers  plus an extra pair of hands during the day to collect food donated by businesses. Those who can spare just a few hours to play cards or board games or just chat are very welcome.    David said: ""You don't have to know how to resolve someone's issues – just come and be a friend.""    He is training volunteers who have already come forward but is anxious to recruit more and set up induction sessions for them too.    Not all roles are client-facing – the shelter also needs help with laundry  housekeeping  pantry stock rotation and preparing meals on the premises each evening. New recruits to the catering crew have been busy securing food hygiene certificates.    Rev Brown said: ""It's wonderful to come in out of the cold and for the guests to smell home-cooked meals coming out of the kitchen.""    The shelter's doors open each night from 8pm and guests leave at 7.30am  unless the weather is particularly bad. Lunch is on offer from 11am until 2pm. The shelter offers activities such as art therapy as well as advice on issues including mental health and addiction.    Over the past five years  since the shelter first opened  the team have built up a wealth of practical experience and a network of experts who can help address the complex issues which lead to an individual living on the streets.    They work closely with Citizens Advice  Bishop's Stortford Food Bank at the Methodist church  alcohol and drug rehabilitation professionals and East Herts Council's housing options officer for rough sleepers.    The team also partner with other churches  such as the Salvation Army  which provides vouchers so shelter-users can pick their own clothes from the good cause's shop in South Street.    David has a small selection of garments so that anyone turning up in wet clothes can change into something dry  warm and clean  but because space is tight  the shelter is unable to store donations of clothes  which are best directed to the town's charity shops.    The shelter has ample supplies of towels and beddings and uses special fold-up beds  which can be cleaned easily.    It does  however  always welcome donations of tea  coffee and biscuits  which are always in short supply  plus books and games for the guests.

Half of the walking duo that decided back in November 2019 to walk 10 000 steps every day  starting from the 1st January 2020. For those of you have followed us from the start  you might know this  but we thought we’d give the back story of how this came about…     I’ve been friends with Brian Snr on Facebook for a while now  and every year since 2012 he has attempted to walk 10 000 steps a day  every day  for as long as possible. Like we do now  he always reported daily to prove that he was one step closer to his end goal. It started off as a way for him to lose weight and get fit. He quickly gathered support from friends and family  liking the posts  commenting messages of support  and one particular follower (me!) started posting silly hashtags #TeamScullySnr #WalksForDays #HeAlwaysWalksAlone becoming some of my favourites.     Brian’s previous record was 142 days back in 2016.    Fast forward to November 2019. Brian Jnr and I met up in London to watch a show at the o2. As Brian Snr works in the city  we arranged to meet up at the pub at Kings Cross station. I had to ask the question that people that had seen his posts for the last few years  were dying to know ‘are you going to walk again next year?’ Brian was unsure.     I quickly came out with ‘if you do it  I’ll do it with you’ – I might have been a couple of pints/gins in at this point! Brian Jnr laughed. Claimed that we’d never be able to do it. So confident  that he wagered £100. If we both walked 10 000 steps a day  for 143 days  he would pay us £50 each. The bet was made and the challenge set.     I’ll be honest  the only day I’d walked 10 000 steps last year  was that day in London. And I got no-where near it again for the rest of November and December. First of January came and I was worried what I had got myself into!    On Friday 22nd May 2020  we’d done it! No-one had ever heard of coronavirus back in November when this was discussed. Through all dark  cold and wet nights  to the country going into lockdown and only being allowed out once a day to exercise  we’d managed to still walk 10 000 steps every.single.day.    It had never been about the money for us. We streamed a zoom call between the three of us to Facebook live and announced that we wanted to donate the money to a local Peterborough charity. Brian Snr lives just outside of Peterborough  and although I now live in Bournemouth  I grew up in Market Deeping  so it seemed like a no-brainer. Amazingly  our dear friend Maxine offered to match Brian Jnr’s donation too!    We’ve had so much amazing support  and with the excitement and emotion that came on that day  we somehow managed to sign up for another 143 days!! Our new target date is Monday 12th October 2020. We have another £100 wagered with Brian Jnr.    Thank you so much if you’ve managed to read this far. And please if you can  help us raise as much money possible for all the amazing work Give Back Peterborough do in their local area.

Following my last update I felt happier and calmer. Police investigation progressing  albeit slowly. My new job was going well. Crucially  my housing stabilised.    I wanted to thank you all sooner  but earlier during lockdown I experienced Covid-19 coronavirus symptoms and have not yet fully recovered. I believe I suffered a mini-stroke when I was most sick and am continuing to struggle with widespread pain  migraines and neurological symptoms  fatigue and exhaustion after only light activity. Unfortunately  my health has resulted in unforseen spending. Person I used to live with threw even more debt my way in recent months. I didn't anticipate this malicious behaviour to continue — three different debt advisers have described me as a ""sitting duck.""    The consequence is my outgoings have risen unexpectedly and lockdown has eliminated my ability to work overtime or find another job meaning that I'm unable to pay bills again. Because I can't make regular usage payments or repay debts I've been repeatedly threatened with gas and electricity disconnection which is now imminent. I fear what will happen as lockdown is eased further. I am receiving ongoing debt advice but honestly there's little that can be done without clearing these debts *and* increasing my income  which is why I've decided to post another update  raise the goal and restart this fundraiser. I hoped your support would be enough for me to get back on my feet  but my situation is precarious. ---     *Original text from August 2019* This is incredibly difficult to write  but I need to ask my friends  acquaintances and perhaps even some people whom I don’t know  to help me get through the next few months. The situation is going to escalate rapidly because my employer is deducting more than 25% of my pay from September onwards  to recover two overpayments they made in error for a really long period  without me or payroll noticing.    I’m already on a low income and have been trying to find a more stable job. Until now I’ve been working two jobs  but my temporary one is coming to an end and I will only have my permanent job – where they have persistently threatened to dismiss me on health grounds so aside from the overpayment recovery  I just can’t hold on there for much longer.    Whenever I do give my notice or get dismissed  they’ll take the entirety of my final month’s pay.    I live alone but the person I used to cohabit with left substantial utility bill debts at our home that I didn’t become aware of until later. There’s not enough space to move another person in  and I can’t move out right now for financial and contractual reasons.    Because of an active police investigation that I can’t go into  I’ve already borrowed money for unexpected costs like home security  numerous phone calls to charities and agencies offering professional advice  and private therapy which I had to quit.    My health has dramatically worsened – I’ve been to a&e twice in the past fortnight because of a kidney infection that didn’t respond to treatment and I had to pawn things to pay for my antibiotics  but there’s not much of value left for me to sell.    I need to wear glasses but have been doing without for several months since they broke; I’m doing without a lot of things. One of my cats needs dental surgery soon but this isn’t going to be possible. My mobile phone has also broken.    I earn slightly too much to claim benefits or get free prescriptions and despite years of hospital referrals  I am still fighting for a diagnosis to explain my physical health problems so I’m not currently eligible for any support that could be claimed.    Unfortunately I’m estranged from one parent  not currently on good terms with the other who wouldn’t help anyway  and I don’t have regular contact with my extended family.    I don’t have savings and I wouldn’t realistically be able to repay any further money borrowed.    Up to this point I’ve managed to keep on top of the rent and buy cat food but I have now begun going without my own food  even before overpayment recovery has started. I’m hoping to access a food bank next week but the period I can use them for will be limited.    It’s hard to put a figure on how much help I should ask for  since my only realistic solution is finding a job with an employer that can offer greater flexibility and is more considerate towards people with chronic health needs. But I am hopeful that if I can just get straight with the money I already owe and raise some more to buy myself time whilst finding a better job  then I can make things work.      *Updated October 2019* I began asking for help one month ago. I am starting a new job in November; I left my employer because they were threatening to dismiss me on health grounds and had also begun to deduct more than 25% of my pay. However I have been panicking instead of celebrating  because they are going to take the entirety of my final month’s pay and my union have confirmed I can't stop them. The support that people have offered me this past month has been wonderful; it enabled me to cover a significant shortfall when my employer started their recovery  ensuring my overdraft was replenished  my rent paid and my cats fed.    But I must raise more before the end of October or I will lose my home. As well as replacing an entire month's income  I also need to fight off utility disconnection and take my cat to the vets.    I have received extensive debt/housing/welfare advice and there's nothing can be done to prevent this situation from happening.    Thank you for reading all the way down; I am extremely grateful to anyone who can donate or share this page. I don’t have many followers and would really appreciate people making this more visible.",False

I am in constant contact with a charity and try my best to help out all year  wherever I can. I received a list from the charity for about 60 kids  showing their ""wish list"" item. I was HEART BROKEN to see some children asked for a hat  or a deodorant set  or socks when they could have asked for anything. There wishes were small and simple. Some were asking for items to share with their siblings too - still in that moment not thinking about themselves. These kids have nothing or very little. I know from my childhood  and looking at the kids rooms in my house  this is far from what we know about. I have put in every single gift from this entire list (some bigger gifts  some smaller) and the total was just shy of £1200.00. I was hoping to be able to get each child their wish list present. I did bump the children who asked for too little (the child that asked for deodorant and the other child that asked for a hat) - I added a board game for each of them at £10. I was also hoping to get the family £10 of food per child. Although food banks are helpful  we are trying to get them a christmas day meal sorted as we have the ability to buy in bulk through Daves (who is a chef) suppliers. That brings the total to £1700 (£28.33 per kid) to get them their dream present and a nice christmas day meal.

Its unprecedented times with COVID-19 spreading throughout the world and it is most definitely now Nourish  along with the fabulous local community groups pulling together as a whole  needs to step up and support everyone. Its vital that we make sure noone is going without  despite the devastating effect panic buying is having on the vulnerable. People are going without the necessary. Many business's are trying so hard to keep afloat by offering deliveries and takeaways  which is great but only if you have enough money to survive like this.   I will be doing door step deliveries of frozen ready meals  free to absolutely anyone who is struggling. I have had to make some changes to do this and this means sourcing ingredients away from supermarkets and scale up volume which means its going to cost a little bit more financially.     I appreciate that times are going to be hard for many of us but if you could spare a little to help fight the great fight  then I thank you from the bottom my heart - please  stay safe  stay well and together with care  we can get through this.    This is my story should you care to read on :)    I used to work many years ago as a cook and learned so much from my late mum but illness struck and I lost my confidence. Only through volunteering and thanks to the patience of Monkton Wyld Court and to Halff in Axminster in very recent years did I gain my confidence back in a professional kitchen environment.     I myself know what its like to live on the breadline and have watched in horror what the impact of Welfare Reform has done to people in our community and beyond. With benefit sanctions being handed out almost at the drop of a hat  the bedroom tax  disability benefits now even harder to access and Universal Credit people are really struggling. Here in Axminster we have one or two avenues in which to source out food to help us get by when times are hard. Our Food Bank is a wonderful and much needed resource which distributes non perishable foods such as dried rice/pasta  tins and processed foods and other necessities. Once apon a time the need for a food bank would have been a short stop gap  but now  for some  its a weekly ocurrance.     The impact of this continual type of diet not only has an effect on our physical well being (more so if suffering a health issue or illness) but on our mental well being too and then  that spiral of isolation  hopelessness and depression can begin.     Nourish insists each meal must have at least two vegetable components not including onions or potatoes. We cook in bulk and freeze meals in portions and distribute for those to store/cook at home.     We have been surviving on cash donations (and some food donations) given personally by hand by the kind people of Axminster (and even some who dont even live here!!) and its those important donations that allow us to cook meals full of nourishment to compliment the already existing food bank facilities in the town. It is hoped that our meals are a nutritional break without the thought of having to cook. A little bit of love to try to ease people through some really hard and dark times.     Nourish is also putting into plan how to ease ""holiday hunger"" when the schools finish for the summer holidays. Many parents rely on that free school meal in term time to ease the grocery bills and sadly sometimes that is the only meal some children may get.     Any money raised or donated to Nourish will go towards mostly fresh ingredients for our meals. There are some other necessary costs  like the containers and admin materials and occasionally some rent/hire costs.     Incidently  if you are a local grower or allotment user.. please think of us when you have an abundant crop of vegetables and fruits :)    Nourish is working in Axminster and has been met with such positivity and your donation is very very much appreciated.

My Mum found herself on Universal Credit after being unfit to work. She was having investigative treatment to identify what ""arthritis"" she had in her knee to begin with. As time passed on UC  her quality of life deteriorated rapidly. She sat in the cold (no money for heat)  the dark (No money for electric or TV Licence) so she spent months alone in her increasingly flea infested home (No money to pay council fee for extermination). Eventually  the fleas got so bad she ended up with (what we later found out was) Sepsis from the bites. Mum weighed under 7 stone and was very poorly  but still expected to fight at a tribunal ALL her money was stopped at this point.  2. I took Mum out of the property and brought her to live with me. I nursed her bites and fed her and our family off my business revenue for months. To the point my business  Hinch Hauls Delivery Ltd has had to cease trading I worked tirelessly day and night to build an exciting  successgul business from scratch and I was more proud than I have ever been.   3. Mum was diagnosed with final stage Bone Cancer and given a very short expectancy so not only was she diying but she had to die in poverty through no fault of her own. Lee and I had to battle the HM revenue for Mums money which was paid to her a week before she died by which time she was bed ridden unable to spend anything She was also told following diagnosis that she couldn't have any treatment at all  she wasn't suitable and their reasons.....? She was too underweight to be able to cope with radiotherapy.  5. Following her Cancer diagnosis  she visited the hospital via A&E a number of times unable to breathe as the cancer spread through her lungs and bones. Every time  she was left on a corridor crying  coughing up blood  wetting herself  screaming in pain and we were told...""there's no beds"" The images circulating of that boy being treated on the floor is NOTHING to what my Mum endured and many other poor people I have witnessed.   6. Mum had a final payment of £650 which was for the rent  paid to her account but bounced back as her acc had already been closed. I called Universal Credit to request the payment be sent to me and they told me she died a day too early to be entitled to the money  had she lived a full 28 days out of the month she would be entitled to it but she died a day early and do is entitled to NOTHING?   7. I am trying to declare bankruptcy as we have had to take the revenue from my business to pay for my diying Mother. We used a food bank on Wednesday another low we've sunk to There is no help for us apparently but plenty of bailiffs at the door trying to take our things...AND FOR WHAT!!!? TAKING TIME TO TAKE CARE OF MY MUM AS SHE DIES!!?   I am DREADING Christmas when my kids ask why they didn't get many gifts compared to their friends  dreading my mum not being here.  We're living a nightmare and I can really relate to the UC suicides happening all over  there is really no way out :(     I know Christmas is round the corner and everyone has their own presents and things to buy for but if anybody can find it in their heart to contribute anything I know it would mean the world to Jodeane and her family..

And families get the help they need for as long as they need it  until they get back on their feet. If you normally donate a few tins to a Harvest collection and could instead spare a couple of quid for Preen to buy food  toiletries and other emergency items it would help so much. They will need more than I can raise alone but anything you give will help somebody. Thank you so much. There’s info about Preen’s foodbank and furniture bank at www.preenreuse.com. ",False

All proceeds from download sales and donations will go to the charity's UK Coronavirus Response Appeal.    How it all happened …    Shortly after KanOwurmz formed in 2015  keyboard player Giordano Girotto dusted off an instrumental piece he had written years earlier under the working title ""Hope"" and shared it with the rest of the band. Songwriter Debbie Elliott then locked herself away with copious cups of tea to add the lyrics and melody line and  soon afterwards  the band began performing the song live at venues across Yorkshire.    In April 2020  three weeks into the coronavirus lockdown  the band members decided to put a song together to raise money for a UK charity. The British Red Cross was chosen because of the work it was doing to help those in need during the crisis  including working with food banks and teaming up with supermarkets to get surplus stock to those who need it most. ""Hope"" was the perfect song choice  but Debbie changed the lyrics to reflect the difficult situation everyone was facing  while injecting a sense of positivity and gratitude at the same time.     Initially  everyone thought it would take just a few days to get the song ready for release  but how wrong they were! The project turned out to be a huge learning curve for all five band members - recording individually at home with click tracks (the band still haven't met since their last gig in March)  learning how to use the recording software (with huge compatibility issues)  trying to help each other over the phone and WhatsApp  and mixing and producing the final version. Of course  putting a slideshow video together for the first time was another story  but it's now ready for release on YouTube and includes images of York's empty city centre during the early stages of lockdown. Every ounce of effort has been worth it and  all things considered  everyone involved is quite amazed by the result! The band had been looking forward to playing a string of gigs this year in and around York  including the Rockin’ all over the Wold festival in Easingwold on 11 July  but working on a project like this has allowed them to stay creative and share something new with their followers  old and new.    ""Hope (Lockdown Session)"" is available to download from 3 July 2020:  Amazon  Anghami  Apple Music  MediaNet  Deezer  Google Play  iHeartRadio  ClaroMusica  iTunes  KKBox  Napster  NetEase  Pandora  Saavn  Spotify  Tidal and Tik Tok/Resso.

Although we are trying our level best in treating patients affected by covid-19 in hospital  I feel that there is a lot more we need to do to help these patients in hospital as well as those affected by this pandemic in the community.    Many people are temporarily out of jobs and are struggling to make ends meet. Basic necessities such as food supply and toiletries for many families has become a burden. Families are having to resort to food banks to ensure that their families have something to eat. However  food banks are also in major crisis as they are opening their doors to more people than ever before during this covid-19 pandemic. Provisions that they would normally be supplying per week is now being distributed within a day.     At the same time  many patients in hospital are taking their last breaths of life alone without any relatives beside their side. Families are yearning to see and hear the voices of their loved ones fighting this disease in hospital alone. Yet  due to the highly contaminated nature of this disease  many hospitals are reluctantly having to stop normal hospital patient visiting times. Many patients with a background of dementia and/or Alzheimer's find it very difficult to understand why they are in hospital and what is happening to them. More so  being in an unfamiliar hospital environment without any families visiting them makes it even more difficult for them in aiding their recovery. It breaks my heart that families cannot come to see their loved ones knowing that they are in their last few hours or days of life.     The reason I am setting up this fund raising page is to help both patients and families to be connected in the hospital as well as those affected by covid-19 in the community. The money we raise will be used for two primary causes:    1) To collect enough money to buy food and basic toiletries that can be distributed to local food banks to keep up the pressure of ensuring that nobody goes hungry during this covid-19 pandemic.     2) To collect enough money to buy electronic ipads  phones and phone chargers for patients to stay connected through face-time with their families on the outside whilst they are fighting off this disease alone in hospital.     Charity does not decrease one's wealth  in fact charity is like a flowing river  you can only gain from its clean water. ""The best of us are those who bring greatest benefits to others"".

This was their only source of income as well as a much loved family business  built by my late dad and brother for the last 20  plus years. I’d say the van is a bit of a fife icon - being down the prom in Kirkcaldy  Highland games and most recently in Randolph industrial estate. This business means the world to my brother and he is absolutely devastated to have had to cease trading  particularly so soon after losing our Dad. As well as the business suffering  Chris has also suffered some pretty difficult health issues this year which has really knocked him for six  making dealing with this even more emotional and challenging. For those of you who know my brother personally  you’ll all know what a big heart he has and how much he helps anyone who needs it.

My daughter Amanda Bruce is a victim of a situation similar to that of the wind rush generation. She was made stateless in February 2016 and was unable to work  lost her job and unable to claim any benefits until the resolution in May 2018 and was given a passport within 24 hours of calling the wind rush hotline and reinstating her right to work. I am a British citizen   as was my partner. We went on a family holiday to Australia for a year (as my partners both again British parents emigrated to in the 1960 s)where my daughter was born. We returned to the UK when she was just 6 months old and has spent her entire life in this country  worked from the age of 16  paid her taxes all up until February 2016. Amanda is a hard working single mother of 2 children  she has struggled to keep the roof over her and her children’s family home in which they have lived for over 10 years . The past 2 years with no income have left her in tremendous debt. Unable to pay council tax which is now in arrears of £2 500 and her rent which is now in arrears of £2000. During the period of being unable to work or claim  my daughter prioritised feeding her son and daughter with the money friends  family and the children’s father although separated; all while sometimes starving her self and paying what little she could to keep the house as the council could not help her in any way due to the fact she was not classed as a British citizen by the government(and was unable to even claim food bank vouchers as she was not in receipt of any benefits due to being left stateless) . My daughter is now faced with the threat of eviction from her private rent company and is unable to be rehoused by the council due to the arrears over the 2 years she could not pay them (a catch 22 situation) . Bailiffs are a common sight knocking on her doors and she fears for her son and daughters well being. We do not come from a rich family  we are working class people and have struggled to keep the rent paid to date but have fallen behind and struggling to get the money together to keep the house. The Christmas holidays are coming up and while many will be celebrating  I know that my daughter will be having many sleepless nights fearing the risk of losing everything through no fault of her own. We are distraught at the way our own government has treated us over these past 2 years; when a hard working individual is victimised by the very system they have worked in for over 20 years. We ask you today for help. All we want for Christmas this year is to know that my daughter and my grandchildren will sleep in their own beds on Christmas Eve. If you wish to read more on this story  the article can be found on the evening telegraph website. I would also like to note that the wind rush compensation scheme(to which was our only means of calling the hotline to get this horrid situation finally sorted) is still in the works and we have been told it could take over 5 years to receive a penny if any ; the threat of eviction is immediate and we worry how long it will be before they are homeless. We hope you can find it in your hearts to help us in our time of need and we thank you all sincerely for taking the time to read my daughters horrific story. Any sort of help would go a long way and would be greatly appreciated  thank you all. We hope no more people are affected by this in the future it really is a horrendous situation for anyone thank you.",False

The lockdown and Covid 19 have been particularly difficult on many BAME  low income and isolated families here in Edinburgh. In June 2020 ELREC started a food project to help bridge the gap between BAME people and food poverty and access to free food services such as food banks. This came about after ELREC was contacted by many community members asking for food support due to job losses  furlough  redundancies  and benefits income not being sufficient to live on for many families and also children being at home fulltime.    ELREC provided this work thanks to local funding but this has now ended  yet the demand for food parcels and halal meat for BAME families remains. The work is all volunteer led and these include ELREC staff  board members and our other volunteers who give up their time to help us deliver this project. ELREC provides on average 30 food parcels per week but not only put the parcels together but also deliver them to any family who are unable to collect them.     There are many BAME families within our communities who need and rely on this food support for many reasons but the standard food banks don’t meet their needs. Therefore  ELREC is asking for funds to top up their food support with specific items they need such as halal meat  nappies  baby milk or any other essential items.     Covid has only made matters worse with new data showing that 14% of adults living with children reported experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity in the last 6 months. Four million people including 2.3 million children live in these households. This compares to pre-Covid-19 levels of 11.5% amongst households with children.    The data revealed that 12% of adults living with children reported skipping meals because they could not afford or access food in the last 6 months.    4% of adults living with children reported having gone for a whole day without eating in the last 6 months.    10% of parents/guardians  affecting an estimated 1.9 million children  reported some form of child food insecurity in the past 6 months. Despite people returning to work and children to school  food insecurity remains extremely high for families.    While vital measures like the furlough scheme and Free School Meal vouchers may have prevented the situation worsening  a large number of children are still left in a precarious situation when it comes to securing the necessary healthy diet for them to grow  develop and participate actively in school and society. We want food equality for all  regardless of background.     Please donate what you can and help us keep doing this important work for our community.

My Dad  James Yule  recently turned 81 and  being on housebound lockdown for 12 weeks  he decided to do Couch to 5k on the back garden path.    (When my friends heard about Major Tom’s 100 laps for NHS  they thought it was my Dad!) Why?  Someone  BP  from a group he’s on  posted on the group page that - even though James didn’t ask for it - BP wants to sponsor him to complete his challenge  and he offered a donation to a charity of James’s choice!    This gave James his altruistic idea - That if people would like to encourage him to do it  by way of sponsorship  and other people can benefit from what he’s doing  then why would he get in the way of such generosity?!    As food and basic health needs are so fundamental/crucial for the people in the world who are most struggling  he would like the raised monies to go to the local food bank and/or care needs in the community.  St. Andrews Foodbank says:    “Those we serve may have lost their job  had a family split up  be victims of domestic violence  or had benefits delayed or suspended. In desperate times we are able to meet their immediate need for food.”  May we extend our human kindness to them.    How?

I will post updates between now and the end of May  by which he hopes to be able to complete a 5km run  actually running  for the half hour that the programme builds runners up to (and do the remainder by whichever means)!

He also has angina  a heart condition which makes running that bit more challenging for his body. So he will be doing it gradually/sustainably.

The island is an island of tourism  many of the inhabitants come from the other islands in Cape Verde to work and rely on the wealth of the world for their survival. The island is poor at the best of times  relying solely on tourism. The wages are low but the cost of living is the same as the UK  if not more. Some essential items like Paracetamol can cost an average of £5 per packet  completely unaffordable by the locals. Like the rest of the world  the island is now in quarantine  but this means the islanders are not allowed to leave to travel back to their native islands and live with their families. Without tourism  the locals are without wages and money or financial aids to support themselves - yet are expected to live and survive on next-to-nothing. There have been a few charities set up and have already started to hand out some food to the families  but it's not enough. With majority of supplies coming from overseas and high demand  the local shops have doubled their prices  so food is considerably more expensive and unafforadable for most. My daughter  Chiara often says to me ""Mum  you can't save everybody"" and of course I know she's right. Whilst I know money is tight in the UK and around the world  I just cannot ignore how these locals  who depend on the rest of the world must feel. I feel compelled to try to help them  hence this ""gofundme"" page. The monies will go directly to the locals to buy basic food  of rice  vegetables  water and supplies and distributed to the families in need. I hope you will consider their plight and help  any small donation will help and be a significant difference to those who need it the most. There will be difficult months ahead until tourism replenishes the island again  but they are the most fantastic and beautiful hosts. The islanders of Boa Vista will welcome you and any guests with open arms  today and always - so much you will never want to leave their beautiful island. Lastly  I thank you for taking the time to read this on behalf of the locals whom depend on tourism for survival.

Sponsor me to help to achieve my goal to become a vegetarian. During this Covid 19 crisis and still until today  I have had support from a charity called The Sikh Soup Kitchen being one from the vulnerable group. Having no family around and Mom stranded in India I have had to call on them for support. They provide me with a hot meal  sandwiches and snacks along with daily essentials  so that I do not have to worry about going out. I am not the only one and they provide this support to the elderly and vulnerable- I am amazed for the amount of work that they do. They provide it to anyone in the Community that require any support. They provide a Street Food Bank Service every Friday and Saturday on Soho Road  Handsworth  where they hand out food to the people in need regardless of faith or race as they have strong Sikh principles to help anyone that they come across. The Sikh Soup Kitchen are a community/ food bank based service  whom you can call on and they will provide you with support and vegetarian cooked meals including any social support adhering strictly to the Government guidelines. I have been inspired by them to become a vegetarian from the lovely cooked meals that they have been providing to me in this pandemic. They also have a dedicated phone line  where you can call during the pandemic for a ‘friend to chat’ service. Please help me to achieve my goal to become a vegetarian and the money raised will go to The Sikh Soup Kitchen  so that they can continue to support the community in need with daily deliveries and Street Food Bank service (everything brought is transparent as receipts are shown on social media). If anybody wants to see them in action or volunteer then please contact me and I can arrange this for you. You are able to follow them on Twitter and see their daily work in action. @SikhSoup Please support me- I want to become a vegetarian and also support The Sikh Soup Kitchen with their ongoing selfless service. All funding achieved will go to them which will continue to provide the daily meals and Serve the Street Food Bank. Thank you Jas Kaur ",False

We’ve had some amazing moments up on the roof - a country band  a brass band  a choir  as well as coverage from national media including the BBC and several viral clips online.    After 20 weeks of rooftop shows at the end of September I’ll finally be bringing this season of concerts to a close. So to make sure we go out with a bang - I’ve decided to make the last couple shows on September 11th & 18th really special.   I’m going to collaborate on these last shows with Grime MC’s from my local area of Tottenham. As a folk/country artist primarily  this is a really exciting prospect to me. It’s a chance to reach out beyond my musical comfort zone  and to create something new  spontaneous  and which speaks to the moment we’re collectively living through. I don’t know how folk and grime are going to sound when combined - but I’m very excited to find out.       I also feel like it’s a chance to create an encounter between parts of my neighbourhood that might not always have that much to do with one another - and with any luck to foster a sense of togetherness through the power of music.      To pull this off we need to upgrade our live streaming set-up significantly. Every week since the start of April I’ve been broadcasting the shows from my phone - but to capture a concert on this scale  involving a full country band and MC's across 3 rooftops - we need to hire a multi-camera set up  with professional audio. A collaboration like this will also involve rehearsals and musicians fees. I’m doing all of this at absolutely the lowest possible cost I can - but in all honesty we’re still a little over a grand away from covering costs.       So in order to make this a reality - I’m asking for your help to balance the books - anything that you feel able to chip in towards making this goal a reality  will be received with enormous gratitude and appreciation. Anything that we make above the goal will go directly to our wonderful partners #LiveForLove  the campaign to support UK Food Banks  for whom we’ve played 18 shows and counting!       Thanks for checking this out. I feel like we’ve got a unique opportunity to create something really special here before the end of summer. If this sounds like something you'd like to support  and you feel able to chip in  be a part of it and and help us pull off - huge gratitude and appreciation are in order. THANK YOU.",False

Each cyclist fundraising goal is to end hunger  for at least the next 6 months  for their own family and 90 other families in need of food support by raising funds for the Siem Reap Food Bank through the ride.    https://www.lifecyclecambodia.org/    The cyclists have several things in common:  They are all strong  capable  cool  fun-loving  and admirable.  They each grew up in poverty and it is still a daily concern for themselves and their families  especially now with the economic impact of COVID-19.  They are motivated to help others who need food and health support.  They all have a physical disability due to either birth defects  illness  or accidents (landmine  traffic  industrial etc.).  They all aspire to be community leaders  not for recognition or glory  but for their love of the people in their community.    Phnom Penh to Siem Reap - 251 Kilometers over 4 days    The Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 fundraising ride departs from Phnom Penh on Thursday 16th July and finishes in Siem Reap on Sunday the 19th July.

Who is the Inspiration behind the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event and The Siem Reap Food Bank    Naret Chhoy  is a jewellery and clothing designer and Director and Trustee at Genevieve’s Fair Trade Village in Siem Reap. The shop supports and celebrates the work of people and artists living with disabilities.     Having lost her job with the closure of the shop since the outbreak of the pandemic  this incredible and inspiring woman  with her own disability  is devoting her time and amazing efforts to help some of the most vulnerable families in the community with Essential Care Food Packs.    Naret is one of the amazing 9 Cyclists riding in the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event to raise money for the Siem Reap Food Bank that her and many other volunteers founded in April to support vulnerable families in need of food support due to Covid19.       Your Generous Donation Today Can Help by Feeding a Family of 4 for 80 pence a Day with the Siem Reap Food Bank.    The Basic Care Food Package costs just £26 pounds  which can feed and help sustain an average family of 4 people for one month!

Donor Fees​ - GoFundMe adds a default Tip of 15% to each donation to help them maintain and improve their free platform. The GoFundme Tip is voluntary and you can change the default tip amount when you donate. The minimum donation amount is £5    There are so many families that need your help more than ever  with your kind and generous support your donations (no matter how much you can afford to give ) means we can help keep their physical and mental health intact throughout this Covid19 Pandemic by helping them survive  whilst offering them a glimmer of hope for the future.     Siem Reap Province - Cambodia    Siem Reap is a beautiful idyllic tourist town just a stone's throw away from the spectacular Angkor Wat Archeological Park in Cambodia.    ""If you have ever been to Siem Reap  or Cambodia in general  you will know how warm  friendly  kind and compassionate the Khmer people are"".    Since the lockdown began  hardly any tourists are visiting the city  with visitor numbers to the Angkor world heritage site down by 99.5%  only 650 people visited the Temple in the month of April  that's 20 people per day compared to around 5 000 back in January.    This situation has created a major problem in Siem Reap. The average wage in the city for people who worked within or in connection with the tourist industry is around $4 USD per day  that's less than $3.50p for around 10 hours work or 35 pence an hour.    The city is more or less totally deserted with literally no visitors  there is no money being spent  no income….nothing…zero. As you can imagine  if you were only earning $4 a day ""in normal circumstances""  then you can probably understand why many families really don’t have any ability to save money to help themselves get through the times when the going gets tough…really tough.     There are many reports of people hearing children crying themselves to sleep at night through hunger.     Many families are trying to live off the land by foraging for fruit and vegetables  frogs  snakes and Rats etc  but the basic essentials that we all take for granted in the UK such as Rice  Eggs  Cooking Oil  Salt and Sugar are products that thousands of families in Siem Reap simply can no longer afford.     Real Hunger exists  in Siem Reap Province  because a large number of families  living at or below the poverty line  do not have enough money to consistently put food on the table.    Job losses  due to Covid 19  have pushed the total number of hungry families to an estimated 20 000. That means as many as 80 000 souls in the Province  are going bed hungry tonight without knowing where there next meal will come from.    Why the Siem Reap Food Bank?    Having lived and experienced an amazing life in South East Asia for over 18 years  I wanted to contribute in a meaningful way  to help some of the most vulnerable people through the ongoing Covid 19 crisis.    After many discussions with my wonderful friend  Christopher Leonard who is currently living there and witnessing first-hand the stone cold reality of the situation  we decided together to spend considerable time researching and validating food giveaway programs currently operating in Siem Reap.    Christopher  spent quality time with Naret and Rick and we could both see that with more money  international awareness and resources  The Siem Reap Food Bank could reach out to so many more families in desperate need of support.    The Siem Reap Food Bank continues to make a real sustainable difference to people in risk of extreme poverty and hunger.     So I decided to volunteer my time to support this incredibly important project and I wanted to share with you why I have chosen this specific Food Bank.    The Siem Reap Food Bank initially launched in April to provide Essential Care Food Packages to people living with disabilities to help them survive the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.     The Siem Reap Food Bank support families headed by or including people with a disability  that have seen their livelihoods disappear  along with the tourists and shops  restaurants  hotels and businesses being shut down.    With the situation continuing to get worse it soon became clear that the Siem Reap Food Bank would not just need to support families with disabilities through this unprecedented time  but any families identified to be in urgent need of an Essential Care Food Package to help them survive.    How Your Kind Donation Helps These Families:    Below is one example of a family the Siem Reap Food Bank is helping every month with a £26 Essential Care Food Package:    Mai Lin  a single mom of 4 children  all under the age of 12  suffered a paralysing stroke about 5 years ago. At the time  she was overwrought with fear that she would no longer be able to take care of her babies.     However  she learned how to make shopping bags from old newspapers and the income generated was sufficient for her to support her family and was even enough to send her children to school. Mai Lin’s income dried up completely with the closure of the Genevieve’s Fair Trade Village shop that sold her products  at the onset of the CoVid19 shutdown.     Along with her first food drop  just before Khmer New Year (April 13th 2020)  came the promise of monthly food drops until she is able to get back to making a living for herself to ensure her family survives.      What's Contained in a Monthly Essential Care Food Package:      We only need 1 000 people from across world to donate as little as as £10 pounds (less than then the price of a few takeout coffees) to succeed in reaching our campaign goal to support 100 families.    Please  help us meet our funding goal by making any donation you can afford.     We know that this is very tough time for many  so if you are unable to donate funds can please help us by sharing this appeal in any way you can via ( social media  friends and family as well as any networks you have connections with) help us create awareness and momentum for this ongoing humanitarian crisis.    On behalf of the families you are helping  thank you for your kindness  you really are making a life changing difference.    Myself and Christopher are volunteering for the Siem Reap Food Bank  with Christopher managing the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event and I'm helping to create awareness for the gofundme campaign.     GoFundMe does not operate in Cambodia. Therefore  I started this campaign in the UK on their behalf with a Funding Goal to support 100 families that's 400 hundred people we can help and support over the next six months.     We project that at the very earliest tourists may return to visit Angkor Wat  in December 2020.    Be kind - Be Loving - Be Safe    Akhun Charan (Thank you very much in Khmer)    Brian Taylor & Christopher Leonard    Important information about how funds for this campaign are being processed & delivered to the Siem Reap Food Bank    I am a volunteer for The Siem Reap Food Bank  I'll be assisting them with social media campaigns to increase UK and international awareness. GoFundMe does not operate in Cambodia. Therefore  I started this campaign in the United Kingdom on their behalf to assist them to help an many families as they can.     I solemnly pledge that 100% of all funds raised through this campaign site are automatically transferred to my UK Bank account and then transferred directly into the Siem Reap Food bank ABA bank account in Cambodia.     HOW DONATIONS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED    Our goal is to make sure the Siem Reap Food bank has continuous cash flow to purchase food & other essential items throughout the coming months  therefore monies will be transferred to their bank account on a regular basis.     The Siem Reap Food Bank Use of Funds: To purchase and distribute essential food and health items for families in need of food support living throughout the Siem Reap province.    Essential costs: To pay for the products being purchased and supplied  plus a few dollars for delivery.

Her funeral is on 15th June. Unfortunately we can't safely have any other mourners  but a few people have asked whether they could make a donation in her memory. A lifelong Labour voter - despite having issues with pretty much every leader! - mum was a huge supporter of food banks. She could never understand how it was possible for such a supposedly wealthy nation to have so many people living in poverty. And the idea that people struggled to feed their children broke her heart. Times are hard  and no one knew that more than my mum. But if you're able to make a contribution  no matter how small  that would be wonderful.
