GFTH was set up just over 5 years ago to provide hot meals  free haircuts  clothing and toiletries to the homeless and vulnerable in our community.    Since then GFTH have set up a full time foodbank and in the past two years have served over 15 000 meals and over 3000 free food parcels to the homeless  vulnerable and those needing a helping hand. Pretty impressive right?!    GFTH have recently started a daily hot food programme with approximately 3500 meals served in the past two months alone.    All this is done with founder Hash Norat holding down a full time job (as well as many of the volunteers too).     We now need your help to raise £10 000 collectively  for us to purchase a food trailer. This will allow us to support more of our homeless and vulnerable in our city but more importantly  all of Gloucestershire.    I am taking part in a fundraising cycle from Gloucester Cathedral to Land's End  to be completed over two days.     Please help us to make our vision a reality  by sponsoring anything you can. Every penny helps!     Your every penny will be supporting our most vulnerable for years to come.     Again  please check us out on Facebook and see all of the great work that we do.     Thank you so much I’m advance.     Steve",False

We need to thank the Union Methodist Church  Union Row  for all the support they gave us while we were there.   It was a shame we couldn't stay.   Ever since leaving the church we have still kept a look out for the right place  with no luck. In June 2021 we took a different approach and opened the Community Shop in Duck Street  Margate  which is proving popular. The members are able to buy food at subsidised prices.   Also  we still help the most needy in our community with free food or vouchers when needed. We still rely on the wider community for support  as having the shop means we have overheads like rent  electricity  water rates and insurance to pay. It takes a lot of time keeping the shop stocked and open. Without our wonderful volunteers  this would not be possible.

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.    All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.    If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free. Thankyou for your support.    The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need  providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.    All the best    Jack Monroe.

The project is being run out of St Edmund’s church hall on Lanehouse Rocks Road in Weymouth. Donations of non-perishable food items and household items are welcome between 10:30am and 12:30pm on Thursdays.    However  because of changeable COVID restrictions on people moving from place to place  we're also launching a crowdfunding campaign to allow us to buy additional essential food and non-food items on your behalf.    Your donation is really important to someone who is in desperate need of emergency food during this unprecedented crisis. Your help is really appreciated. Thank you.",False

The player in question will be the one who scores the first goal for Town after the target has been reached.     --    The Welcome Centre is a Huddersfield-based foodbank that provides basic essentials to people in need. Unfortunately  the COVID-19 crisis has seen demand for their services rise and donations fall. To help  and in the absence of matchday donations  the Huddersfield Town Supporters’ Association (HTSA) and other Fans For Foodbanks partners are asking people to donate what they can.     All donations  no matter how big or small  or greatly appreciated. Stay safe and keep the faith. ",False

(Please support and please share)    Inchgarth has now launched the second phase of our gofundme campaign to support people during the covid-19 pandemic following your wonderful support during 2020.  We know that for many families  individuals  and businesses that things are extremely tough just now  but for those who may be able to donate a couple of pounds  then we would be hugely grateful for your support that will allow us to help those most in need.    People can donate directly via this gofundme appeal page  or if you prefer  we can accept donations of non perishable food items directly at the centre Monday to Friday 10am-5pm.    Over the last 12 months your support and wonderful donations have not only helped to sustain our organisation  but it's helped a tremendous amount of families and individuals in their greatest hour of need  and your support really has made a massive impact on their lives.    Our support project  which the foodbank is one stand of  is helping not only people in Garthdee  but 14 other communities in Aberdeen south  while we are helping many organisations to support their clients too. The need is real  the need is genuine  and every penny of your support sustains and supports.    No matter how small your donation may be  whether it's one pound  or one tin of food  it's hugely appreciated and makes a difference and we are hugely grateful  as are those benefitting from your generosity.

Many individuals and families have suffered additional hardship during this period and demand for foodbank services has increased significantly over this time and continues to rise. The ending of the furlough scheme at the end of October is likely to result in this demand increasing further as more people are unfortunately likely to be made redundant.    The foodbank at Danebury Drive has been run since the start of lockdown by one individual from her own front garden. Initially this was on a small scale helping a number of local families  but has grown significantly to the point where currently 50 food parcels are produced weekly with an addition 75 individuals access the food on offer for collection for themselves and families.    As a result  the foodbank has become a valuable resource for families on the North and East sides of Acomb. This is one of a network of community foodbanks set up across the city who are all working together to share resources best they can.    The onset of winter means that to continue premises need to found as running this outside with no cover will no longer be viable. Premises have been found at a local church with the offer of a peppercorn rent. In addition to rent funding will be required to cover rent and fuel costs    The foodbank currently receives a significant amount of food donations from Co-op  Fareshare and Morrisons amongst others which is mainly of items such as bread and non-perishable items. Whilst the support has been amazing  this rarely provides sufficient fresh items to support the need  hence the additional purchase of such items mentioned above. Clearly such nutritional items are required for an individual to have a balanced diet  made more important by the fact that many children are supported by the bank.    Up to date the £250pw for fresh items has been covered by a weekly £200pw purchase of produce by a local charity (Kitchen for Everyone York) with the additional made up by the small amount of monetary donations received at the foodbank. However  the current level of support from Kitchen for Everyone cannot be maintained and their support has dropped to £100pw due to a shortage of funding. This level of funding will be continued until the end of 2020.    The costs of powering the fridge freezers and fuel for collection has been borne by the individual running the bank  but this cannot be maintained.    Your help is requested to help continue the service that has been so invaluable for the local community  especially as there are concerns that demand is more likely to increase in the short term rather than decline.",False

Last November as Manchester entered lockdown restrictions local foodbanks came under increasing pressure and seen a huge increase in the need of food support. At the time I decided to embark on a wee running challenge to help raise some much needed funds for the Manchester South Central Foodbank.   One year on and food banks are again gearing up for another surge in demand as the most vulnerable people are plunged into further poverty due to the end of the furlough scheme  steep rises in energy bills and the recent cuts to Universal Credit.  Last year we raised over £7000 running 10km a day for 30 days straight..  This year I’m gonna up the ante and ‘attempt’ to run 15km everyday in November.  Thats 105km a week..   450km over the month..   That’s an extra 35km a week and 150km across the month compared to last year!   If we can raise even a fraction of the money we did last year it will be more than worth it!! Any funds raised will help massively towards the pressures over the Christmas period and will help those most in need.  All donations no matter how small will be deeply appreciated and will go a long way.  Also  any runners out there hit me up! I’ll need some support & encouragement to stay on track!  And we’re off.. ‍♂️",False

This support started when there was no halal food support in the local area of Sharrow and Netheredge and people were struggling to buy basic food for themselves. Due to a gap in the area and a desperate need TSY collaborated with few others to collectively reach out to the most vulnerable including single parents  elderly  self isolating and hardship such as loss of income. All our work is voluntary and since March kind donations from local community has assisted us in making sure no one struggled alone. We are running low on cash donations to purchase food to continue this vital support and are reaching out to anyone who can support us by using this link and donating whatever little they can towards the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank project. Due to the level of need and referrals coming in since the start of this halal foodbank  we have called it Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank to avoid any barriers to any non-muslim vulnerable that maybe in need of this support. We would be very grateful for your support towards this cause and request you to please share widely amongst your contacts.

This year  everything is a bit different.     We would like to give people needing the foodbank a gift voucher to use just as they wish. To buy something they really need. And especially for parents - to be able to buy the gifts that their kids are wishing for.     Do you want to help? Rather than donating a wrapped gift this year  please contribute to our campaign. We will use all money raised to buy gift vouchers from Argos and B&M  and distribute these to people using the foodbank in time for Christmas. We would love your support!

We use the van each week to collect and deliver donated essential furniture such as beds and cookers to people in need.

Demand for help from Wells Vineyard Foodbank & Furniture Storehouse has risen 6-fold during the pandemic. In 2021  over 80 000 meals have been distributed in our area. People are referred by support agencies  GPs and schools and will receive a food box with approximately 4 days worth of food with 3 meals a day plus toiletries.     The Furniture Storehouse recycles donated furniture  stores it and distributes it free upon referral. In 2021  266 items of essential furniture such as beds and white goods were delivered to people in desperate need. Without a working van  we can no longer offer this service. We already have a third of the money we need to buy a van  but need your help to make this happen! You can make a difference by donating today to WELLS VINEYARD CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP.

It is more important than ever that we work together to support one another. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund has launched to provide support to those most at need in our community. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund Right now many of us are understandably feeling anxious and vulnerable  but there are many among us that need immediate support in order to ensure that they can have access to food. Greenwich residents have a proud history of looking after one another - and never has this been more important than now. So I have been working with Greenwich Food Bank to create the Greenwich Food Bank Fund. As the borough faces one of its most important challenges in living memory  the Fund has been set up to ensure that those in need across the borough have access to the help they need. Please  even during this most difficult of times  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Greenwich. Please be assured that even the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference. Thank you for your generosity. FAQs Where will the funds go? The funds will go directly to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by the Greenwich Food Bank and delivered to food banks across the borough  from Blackheath to Eltham  Kidbrooke  Thamesmead and beyond. A full list of food bank locations is available at https://greenwich.foodbank.org.uk/locations/. If I donate will it go directly to those who need it? Yes  your donation will go directly to Greenwich Food Bank. Unlike some other platforms  GoFundMe does not charge a fundraising fee although it takes a small transaction fee. See https://www.gofundme.com/c/free-fundraising for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to. Will the money be spent in Greenwich? Yes. Is there anything else I can do? The most immediate need is to raise finance  so that purchasing can continue. However there is also a need to: (1) donate food where possible; and (2) create a team of delivery drivers as the Food Bank moves to a delivery model. If you are able to help with either of these  please email [email redacted].uk. Where can I find more information about Covid-19? For general information on CV-19  please visit the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response or the NHS at https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/.

Food donations are always most welcome  but they are sometimes not practical for people  while cash donations are a great help  as they mean not only we can buy in particular items when we run short of them   to help make up balanced parcels  they also act as a much-needed fall-back fund when food donations are low  so we can still maintain our service every week.

Due to the pandemic  countless numbers of small and local businesses have been forced to close - with barbershops/hair salons being examples of the businesses that are suffering the most. Now  the normal response for the owner of a business like this would be to take advantage of rate relief  seek bridge funding for the business and also look for financial support being offered to people that are self-employed.    But not Ziggy...        Ziggy has converted the Barbershop into a Food Bank that is specifically focused on helping the elderly and other vulnerable members of the local community to have access to the food and sustenance they need in a time when it may be challenging to make trips to supermarkets or go shopping themselves.    We all know that local businesses like barbershops are massive pillars within communities as they are connected to so many people and aware of a range of local issues. So  who better and where better for a Food Bank to support vulnerable people to come from?        As it stands  Ziggy is not only travelling (on his own dime) to his shop  to the homes of people who cannot make it to his Food Bank and even spending his own money to buy food if he is short on donations from local people that are aware his Food Bank Exists. ALL WHILST HE IS LOSING MONEY AS HE CANNOT TRADE AND RUN HIS BUSINESS AS NORMAL.    So  now we need to support this local hero by helping to alleviate the financial pressure that comes from still having to maintain the utility costs at the shop  the transport costs that come with running the Food Bank and also to help access further food to support vulnerable local people.",False

Last year as a group we raised a whopping £3 000 !! Which was a massive increase on 2019. This year we are looking to smash that record again - with your help!!  Mine (and your) contribution last year was £275 which I am so grateful for - but it would be amazing to beat that this year!!    We are just a group of friends who raise money every year in the run up to Christmas to buy food for local food banks around the South Birmingham area.   Now more than ever  your donations and support will mean so much more.  COVID has caused complications and tough situations for everybody  some more than others. Food banks were crying out for food to support local communities last year and this year is no different!!    Any and all donations are hugely appreciated and will go directly to purchasing food and non-perishables requested by the local food banks!!    Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you in advance for your generous donation - you have made a massive difference!!",False

We have therefore decided to run our Christmas Food Bank Drive for the second year running in support of Instant Neighbour  a local Aberdeen charity who provide emergency food parcels and support to vulnerable individuals requiring urgent assistance.     Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic  we have decided to  instead of collecting physical items from individuals  collect monetary donations via a GoFundMe page which will be used to purchase food and supplies for Instant Neighbour to be delivered in a COVID-secure way. All donations will help towards purchasing food items for inclusion in parcels for vulnerable people across Aberdeen. Any donations made can be marked as “anonymous” if preferred.     Any donation  however small will help towards purchasing food items for inclusion in parcels for vulnerable people and families across Aberdeen.    The GoFundMe page will be open for donations until Friday 17th December with a drop-off of the purchased food being scheduled for the week after. Thank you in advance for your generosity.",False

Even though this year has been mad for everyone there is still a lot of people who do not have the support & luxuries that most of us probably take for granted.  Sadly we are still live in a world where people and their families need your support. So again for this Christmas I will be doing a collection for Waterlooville food bank. I will be raising money which will go towards requested gifts for the families or can collect donations of presents/gifts - anything is acceptable!!     If you are in a position to donate anything at all I urge you to do so! It doesn’t have to be much & doesn’t have to be through me  even if over the next couple of weeks you can add a few extra bits to your shopping for your local food bank at a supermarket  anything helps!     So if you have a little extra money to donate this Christmas  I can guarantee there will be someone out there who will really appreciate it!     Please message me if you would like to donate gifts towards this and I’m more than happy to collect any local donations if required!!I will be looking to have donations by the 15th December 2021.",False

I was born in Nigeria and moved to the UK in 2004 to study. I finished my Masters in 2014 and am currently living in the North West area of Merseyside. I have previously worked for Foodbank as a volunteer during the pandemic helping homeless people  migrants  and other vulnerable people.    Situation?    I have always worked and paid my living expenses when I had a student visa. However  because of the hostile environment policy and UK’s draconian immigration system  I do not have permission to work  and I have no recourse to public funds (NRPF)  meaning that I have no access to housing support and benefits. As a result  I have been couch surfing and relying on the kindness of friends to stop me from being street homeless. I am also struggling with prediabetes and need proper nutrition and diet to avoid my situation getting worse.    What’s the plan?    Because I cannot work due to my dispute with the Home Office  I am kindly asking for some financial support to help with my living needs while I await a decision on my application with the Home Office. Thank you for your generosity and kindness during this difficult phase in my life.",False

Wycombe Food Hub (WFH) came about at the start of lockdown. We collected residual food from leading supermarkets. Our products are often short dated ‘Best Before End’ (BBE) dates. These products are still usable. The range varies on what we source each week from our partners. We are collecting over 200 green crates each week.   We supply products to people unable to access or buy food  those that cannot get Government aid or are unable to survive on the Government’s benefit payments  those who are now suffering from loss of jobs and the self-employed who can’t get benefits  those who cannot access the traditional referral foodbanks.   The range of people coming to us for help is growing weekly. Considering what’s happening nationally the need for our food and services will continue to grow.    We are now collecting from even more supermarkets  allotments and farms    We have now secured a retail shop in the centre of High Wycombe. The shop is open 5 days a week   The shop allows us to distribute not only residual food but also offer chilled and frozen food.     Partner organisations are now working with us to signpost and help those needing more care and referral to statutory authorities.     Moving into a retail premises has now incurred us some long-term financial liabilities and we need to reach out for help   We are fundraising for building  building refurb  building repairs  building insurance  equipment and software  electricity and utilities  print and collateral .     We started with a zero funding stream. We have managed to secure some small grants and donations from friendly benefactors  which has allowed us to deliver to the stage we are now .

We are an entirely self funded volunteer led group of like minded local people  young and old  who wanted to do something to help the homeless and needy in our neighbourhood. So in November 2018 we founded the Tooting Community Kitchen. Since then we have run a weekly distribution of hot food  and essential supplies. We now have 50 active volunteers and we have been able to assist hundreds of people  so far!    Currently  every Wednesday and Saturday evening our volunteers are able to provide the following help:    • We distribute food packs to a local shelter for homeless people  • We set up a stall from 5.30pm to 6.30pm next to Tooting Broadway Market where we serve hot food  soups  drinks and hand out toiletries and sanitary products  • Clapham Common Venn St 8pm our hot food and drinks stall serves many who are street homeless  in hostels and supported housing.  • Clapham South  6pm- 6.30pm Refugees in nearby hotels  serving hot food  cakes  drinks and fresh fruit.  • we have recently opened our foodbank based at 104 Upper Tooting Rd  SW17 7EN  walk up Price Close. Fridays 9-1pm food donations drop off. Fridays 9-11am open to guests to collect what they need. Our outreach volunteers visit known places where homeless people sleep in the local community and we provide them with a hot meal  a hot drink  toiletries and sanitary products and sleeping bags  • Our outreach teams are now able to serve people in areas of Wandsworth (Clapham Junction  Putney High Street  and Clapham South / Common / and North.      We urgently need donations so this much needed work can carry on in the community.     Please help us to help those in need.      Tooting Community Kitchen",False

15/2020-09-23 200","The Great Oven has been building giant community ovens and sending them to places of need for over two years – to refugee camps  war-torn communities  and now inner cities in crisis.     Born in Tripoli  Northern Lebanon and operating in refugee camps in the Bekaa Valley throughout the COVID pandemic  we are now responding to the Beirut blast.     With the full endorsement of the Lebanese Foodbank  each of our ovens is capable of producing over 1 000 meals per day. Our plan is to greatly increase this reach by expanding our number of oven sites nationwide.     Our Work To Date    Today  the Great Oven HQ is located next to the epicenter of the blast site  in Lebanon’s most respected nightclub of all places  the Ballroom Blitz. Each day  between 10 - 20 local volunteers contribute to the preparation of meals and supplies which are then distributed to our oven sites.     Over a month on from the blast  with media fatigue setting in and many temporary relief efforts already withdrawing  our work is crucial. We believe that responses to Lebanon’s escalating crisis must be long term in their vision and center the Lebanese people as agents of their own reconstruction and resilience-building process.    By its very nature  The Great Oven is uniquely positioned to provide assistance through this framework. Not only do we set up enduring networks but our ovens are permanent installations that belong to the communities in which they are based. As centres for cooking  teaching and sharing a meal  our ovens facilitate a creative and participatory experience that brings communities together and fosters social cohesion.     Where will your support go?    The Great Oven has self-funded its operations for over two years. We are proud of our self-sustainability but now feel it is time to grow. We can’t do this without your support.    Each kind donation will be used to fund our basic operational costs  all of which are listed below:    - Production and installation of more community ovens in areas of critical need in Beirut and nationwide  - Sourcing local food produce for each oven  - Distribution of food beyond Great Oven sites across the city  - Oven transport and logistics     Our only paid salaries to date  go to marginalised people we founded our movement with. This includes LGBTQ refugees  stateless youths  trafficked women  and ex child fighters to name a few.     More about the Great Oven    We build great big beautiful ovens to feed a great number of people.     But the oven is also symbolic. It represents our belief that the ritual of cooking and sharing meals helps bring communities together  whatever their faith  ethnicity or gender.     We also believe in the rehabilitative power of music and art to restore faith that a better future is possible.     What we offer is not aid in the traditional sense  but the participatory tools to empower a community to build that future for themselves  and with those tools comes an inherent sense of dignity  which is as important as food relief in nourishing a marginalised community.     We work with grassroots  on-the-ground  local initiatives and organisers in order to respond organically and effectively to each community’s unique needs.     What we’re offering in return     The Great Oven was founded by award-winning cook  documentary filmmaker and philanthropist  James Thompson. Our wider team is a collective of chefs  artists and creative thinkers dedicated to making positive change through food and art.     We are eternally grateful for any donation  no matter how big or small. For any substantial contributions  we would like to offer a very special thank you in true Great Oven style:    Donations of £1 000 or more    A private Great Oven feast cooked by Great Oven chefs (and special guests) at your home.    Donations of £250 or more    A seat at a one-off Great Oven community feast in one of the following locations:    Barcelona  Beirut  Berlin  Denver  Dublin  Glastonbury  Johannesburg  Kuala Lumpur  Kinsale  London  Mexico City  Mumbai  New York   Valencia    These feasts will feature several special guests of the culinary  music and art worlds. These feasts will be scheduled to take place when COVID-19 restrictions soften. In the meantime  your name will be added to the guestlist for the feast in your selected city.    Thank you in advance for your kind support. Your generosity means the world to us and to the people of Lebanon. ",False

We need your help to continue to provide for all those in need of support just now.    Since Lockdown in March 2020  the Punjab Restaurant in Covent Garden has been cooking to feed anybody and everybody in need. More than 100 000 hot meals have been provided to homeless organisations; Nishkam SWAT  Gur Seva  Under One Sky and our local church St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square. During the first lock down half the restaurant was converted to HQ  packing and storage facility for Under One Sky. We are doing the same for this second lock down.     Despite business being affected by the pandemic  in our 74 years  the Punjab has never closed its kitchens. MD Amrit Maan has been determined to make the restaurant a community resource to help as many as possible through this difficult moment in history.    All this has been possible with the goodwill of our staff  our own reserves and ability to purchase in bulk  but also from donations of food from businesses that had to close and partnering charities.     Our ""engine"" – our kitchen and volunteering staff - is running at full speed  with the Covent Garden community spirit.       BUT we now need your support to purchase raw ingredients and containers to see struggling families and the homeless through the festive period and into January.    Your donations will be used for basic healthy ingredients: potatoes  onions  cauliflower  baked beans  chick peas  red split lentils and rice.     The cost per serving/box is approximately £1.50 and we’re asking for just 60p towards each serving. We need to serve 1000 meals a week  so our £4800 target will result in 8000 meals to those struggling daily  though we note the need is only increasing.      We’ll be posting regular updates of how your donations are being spent and who it has helped.

In Pakistan  approximately 53 000 children die consequential to waterborne diseases from consuming contaminated water. Water filtration plants work via a complex technology incorporating chemical  biological  physical processes to eliminate toxins and pollutants infecting water. One filtration plant will cost approx £2000  hence due to financial restraints there is often a struggle to implement them on a wider scale in Pakistan. At this moment  our current funds can only stretch to provide for one water filtration plant  which we are in the process of building. This will be located at a mosque so that those in it’s close proximity may enjoy the basic necessity and gift of water. We aim to attend to those in dire need and inshallah with the help of your donations we intend to increase our production and build two more water filtration plants so more communities may quench their thirst with water that won’t kill them. Our goal will be £4000  to be realistic  so to build two filtration plants that will provide to large and suffering communities. If we exceed this amount we can build more inshallah! This Ramadan  your donation could help gift not only water to an entire community but a sustainable system of access to water. Which would mean that a continual amount of clean water can be supplied to local residents for generations to come.Donations can be made in your name  a loved ones name or as sadaqa jariya for one who is no longer with us. On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him)  who said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Allah SWT will say on the Day of Resurrection:“O son of Adam  I asked you to give Me to drink and you gave Me not to drink. He will say: O Lord  how should I give You to drink when You are the Lord of the worlds? He will say: My servant So-and-so asked you to give him to drink and you gave him not to drink. Had you given him to drink you would have surely found that with Me.” Our brothers and sisters need us...let us fulfil our duties as an ummah. Not to mention increase our rewards and our station in the sight of Allah Azzawajal.May Allah reward us all for our efforts! ",False

We have been operating since 2012 in London and became a charity in March 2020. Information about SWAN can be found on our website www.swanlondon.org. We run a foodbank and provide community support to many Refugee and migrant families in London. We have also been providing aid to refugees in Camp Moria since 2018 in partnership with Kitrinos Healthcare and Team Humanity who are both charities registered to work in Greece. We have collected  sent (via container) and provided vital humanitarian aid to Refugees in Moria camp including food parcels  baby milk  nappies  clothes  shoes and blankets and documented the distributions on social media (WhatsApp). Team Humanity are our implementing partner on the ground and they have distributed regular food parcels to new arrivals on our behalf. In recent months there has been a dramatic increase in the number of new arrivals and conditions are horrendous. Many families are living in inhumane conditions with little or new food. Since November 2019 SWAN - with the help of TEAM HUMANITY has been providing bread (which is prepared by Refugees) in the camp to starving refugees in and outside Moria Camp. The cost of preparing each bread is 40 cents. €400 provides 1000 breads. There are currently 21 000+ refugees in Moria and many new arrivals have no funds and the queues are so long for the food provided by the Greek authorities and local charities that many get nothing. All funds received for this campaign will be sent to our implementing partner Team Humanity to pay for preparation and distribution of the bread. The ground team send pictures of each distribution to SWAN which we share with donors for transparency. The bread we distribute is often all they will eat.

Thanks for everyones patience while we got this sorted.      I don’t do things by halves and after seeing the country pull together these last few months i've decided to push myself to the edge to raise some much needed money for some causes close to my heart.      1. Kirkham Food Bank: Many homes have and will be hit hard financially due to covid 19  I want to do my bit for the local community that have supported me so well over the years.      2.Clint Grieve : In March a good friend  fellow doorman and boxer was found at the bottom of the stairs and was unable to move. Sadly he is now paralysed from the neck down and is in desperate need of some additional equipment and adaptations at home to help him on the road to recovery. Due to Covid 19 Clint is unable to receive the level of rehabilitation required which will hinder his recovery.      3. Matthew Savage- Grattan      21 month old Matthew Savage - Grattan from Blackpool has recently been diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma  Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of tissue sarcoma (tumour)  which is only found in fewer than 60 children diagnosed with this rare form of cancer in the UK each year. He is only 21 months old and is being Treated Brilliantly by Manchester Children's Hospital. His family are having to travel to Manchester every week for appointments and have to stay over when Matthew is having his treatments. I want to help contribute to the families expenses during this very challenging time.      I will be splitting the money that I raise equally between these very worthy causes. I will be pushing myself to the limits mentally and physically for 24 hours flipping a 28 stone tyre!! There will be no breaks (accept for toilet ones and the off brew)  I will be monitored and the challenge will be broadcast on my social media pages. There will also be sponsorship opportunities and if you want to come and flip a tyre with me for 30 mins   at a safe distance obviously then you will be more than welcome. 9am Friday 26th th June - 9am Saturday 27th June      Please donate generously:",False

Update: 3rd March  2021    Another interview with The Independent  describing the struggle to survive on Universal Credit and my fears about the cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/budget/budget-universal-credit-20-pounds-b1811750.htmlTaking this opportunity to thank everyone for their ongoing support - you are wonderful and I couldn't do this without you.   .  .  .      Update: 19th January  2021 I've been interviewed by The Independent about the catastrophic consequences of the upcoming Universal Credit cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/b1789040.html      .  .  .        My original message: 30th August  2019    This is incredibly difficult for me to write  but I need to ask my friends  acquaintances and perhaps even some people whom I don’t know  to help me get through the next few months.    I am a domestic abusive survivor struggling to meet essential living costs and the situation is going to escalate rapidly because my employer is deducting more than 25% of my pay from September onwards  to recover two overpayments they made in error for a really long time  without me or payroll noticing.    I’m already on a low income and have been trying to find a more stable job. Until now I’ve been working two jobs  but the temporary one is coming to an end and I will only have my permanent part-time job – where they have persistently tried to dismiss me on health grounds so aside from the overpayment recovery  I just can’t hold on there for much longer.    Whenever I do give my notice or get dismissed  they’ll take the entirety of my final month’s pay.    I live alone but the person I used to cohabit with left substantial utility bill debts at our home that I didn’t become aware of until later  since they lied about having cleared balances. There’s not enough space to move another person in  and I can’t move out right now for financial and contractual reasons.    Because of an active police investigation for rape and domestic abuse that I can’t go into  I’ve already borrowed money for unexpected costs like home security  numerous phone calls to charities and agencies offering professional advice  and private therapy which unfortunately I had to quit.    My chronically poor health has dramatically worsened – I’ve been to a&e twice in the past fortnight because of a kidney infection that didn’t respond to treatment and I had to pawn things to pay for my ongoing prescriptions  but there’s not much of value left for me to sell.    I need to wear glasses but have been doing without for several months since they broke; I’m doing without a lot of things. One of my cats needs dental surgery soon but this isn’t going to be possible.    I earn slightly too much to claim benefits or get free prescriptions and despite years of hospital referrals  I am still fighting for a diagnosis to explain my physical health problems so I’m not currently eligible for any support that could be claimed.    Unfortunately I’m estranged from my parents and I don’t have regular contact with any other family.    I don’t have savings and I wouldn’t realistically be able to repay any further money borrowed.    Up to this point I’ve managed to keep on top of the rent and buy cat food but I have now begun going without my own food  even before overpayment recovery has started. I’m hoping to access a food bank next week but the period I can use them for will be limited.    It’s hard to put a figure on how much help I should ask for  since the only real solution is me finding a job where they’re not actively trying to dismiss me for my chronic health problems  but I am hopeful that if I can just get straight with the money I already owe and raise a couple of months’ living expenses to buy myself time whilst finding a better job  then I can make things work.    Thank you for reading this far; I am extremely grateful to anyone who can donate or share this page. I don’t have many followers and would really appreciate people making this fundraiser more visible. ",False

I’m married to john and have 5 beautiful children.   A few years ago john was working as a helicopter pilot. A career he had wanted since he was a child and absolutely adored.    But then he got sick. He struggled for a long time before doctors figured out he had several auto immune diseases all at once. He struggles every day with pain  sickness  and insomnia. He takes morphine every day and has done for years  with really debilitating side effects because the medical system can’t help him.   He was made redundant from his beloved job and eventually we lost our house to the bank as we couldn’t keep up with the mortgage. This is something he really struggles to accept. Since then we have gone from one disaster to another. We rent a house at the moment that the landlord wants us to move out so they can use it for something else but we have nowhere to go. The council can’t help us. No private landlord will help because john is not working and we cannot afford to get anywhere ourselves.     It’s really hard to watch our kids miss out on so much in their childhood. Some of them are too young to remember the amazing  fun  hardworking dad they had. Now they see him sick and weak and they see all the things they miss out on because we cannot afford it or because he is too ill to take part in it. It’s hard to hide our tears when we know there’s something they want but we can’t give it to them. Or hide our upset when we have to go to the food bank or sell some of our things to give them a birthday present or afford their homeschooling needs.   It’s very humbling to have to hold your hands up and admit you need help. For john to not be able to provide for his family is devastating. He is not able to admit we need help but I as a wife and mother know that humbling ourselves and asking for help is the only option left open to us.     Johns own doctors have told us about medication they believe will really help him and get him off the morphine. But they cannot prescribe this medication on the NHS and unfortunately we cannot afford to buy it privately. John was due to have an operation in January 2020 but it was postponed due to COViD and he is still waiting. He could get this operation in a matter of weeks privately but we cannot afford to pay for it. There are many things we could do to help him get better and get back to work but we cannot afford it. It’s extremely heartbreaking to know there is help right in front of us but we cannot take advantage of it because we don’t have enough money.     We have experienced people’s kindness throughout this process. We feel so ashamed that we have not been able to repay that kindness and to have to ask for more help but that’s exactly what I’m doing. I need my husband back. My kids need their father back and we need some stability in our lives again  we need a forever home.   If you could please help in anyway I would be so so grateful. You have no idea how much your help could change our lives. Please help me get my husband well again and not suffer so much everyday. Please me give my babies a forever home and a dad who is well enough to be the dad he always wanted to be.     Thank you for any help you can give and We would be so grateful for any prayers you could offer for our family. Xx    Edit:  Thank you all so much for your donations. It’s incredibly overwhelming to experience all your generosity and kindness. And thank you also to the people who have personally sent donations directly to us  Mavis & Chris and Marion O’Reilly.   We are totally humbled by your love and kindness. Thank you all xxxx",False

The Project /Building Purley Masjid​    Purley Masjid is a modern Islamic community centre in a suburb of South London  Purley. It was established in 2015 after fund raising to accommodate the needs of the local Muslim community.    Ma Sha’ Allah  the Masjid is now trying to cope with the demand and has to overcome many challenges to support the Muslim and also non-Muslim community. Here are just a few of examples of the issues:     We have one main hall which accommodates only 200 people for an average Jumu’ah congregation of over 400.      People often have to wait outside in the forecourt for the second Jamaat     Current facilities for ladies accommodates around 30  whereas the demand is known to be in excess of 150. This is severely restricting our ability to meet current demand for women     Our lectures  Fitness Classes  Mother and Toddlers group  daily iftaris in Ramadhan and seniors meet up sessions all take place on the same carpeted area on which we pray. This is not ideal and as we are effectively operating out of one hall  it means that we can only have one activity happening at any given time     The Food Bank only has enough space for a shelf rack to store food.

Our brothers and sisters are starving left to fend for themselves in our home country while we out here spending money on things that we don't even need. Spend a few pounds to help those who really need it.    We currently have volunteers going in to buy food and ensure they have clothes and ensure their basic health care needs are met.   However  currently we cannot provide a secure facility or toilet due to lack of funds. Regardless this is better than the streets as many of our service users are exploited by members of the public.    These people need our help to ensure they have a safe home  have food to eat  clothes to wear and access to appropriate mental health support    We want to do more than just provide a food bank and clothes for individuals with mental health challenges/diagnosis.    Long term support to change peoples lives is a more realisable goal with you help.    Providing therapeutic support is required but right now we are relying solely on volunteers who need proper training and better facilities to improve the work they are currently doing.",False

It very quickly grew into an organisation that is continuing to support its community by forming a charity.    What started off as an emergency food bank to those in hardship or those shielding  without access to food  has grown into a range of services  from food parcels  prescription deliveries  counselling and listening  free-cycling  to many other ways of supporting families  the elderly and the isolated.    This fundraiser will help us get established in our new warehouse  with all the associated overhead costs and if we exceed our target  possibly a vehicle to assist us with deliveries to our community and wider Bedfordshire  in support of other agencies and Charities.    Our group has been overwhelmed by the generosity of people and business  during this very difficult time for everyone  and we just know that this community spirit will continue. There is still much work to be done to help our community get through this pandemic and to rebuild their lives and lift their spirits  for which so many will be grateful.    We are also very grateful to the Advance Theatre group  who have busily been preparing a concert entirely from lockdown  to enjoy from the comfort of your own home!

It started as a small venture but as the word got out  it became more and more apparent that there was a huge grey area in the community regarding the support of families who have their lives turned on it’s head over night.    Free Meals  Full Hearts is NOT designed to help the same families on a week in  week out basis. I created the group to support those who maybe too proud or embarrassed to reach out for help or go to a food bank. It was created for families who may have faced redundancy or who are struggling on furlough… it’s for those without a support network around them who needs a little short term support.    I have been overwhelmed with the support in the last 12 months. The newspaper articles and TV appearances has helped raise a huge amount of awareness. And I’m overwhelmingly flattered to have received my Pride of Britain AND Pride of Reading nominations- thank you to everyone who has voted!    The success of this group purely comes down to both the physical donation of food but also the financial support provided by this Go Fund Me page. I would not be able to do what I do without this so thank you in anticipation for your support    All the money raised is used within this group and is withdrawn for food  personal hygiene products and pet products.

The ARK which comes under the umbrella of The Congregation of Yahweh  a registered charity (number 245132)  would like to take this opportunity to ask you for your kind assistance. If you’re in a position to financially support our Food Bank at The Ark  it would be greatly appreciated. We will use your donation to help those who require help and/or support.     At The ARK  we are committed to providing free wholesome home-cooked food for a cross range of families  the elderly  the vulnerable  students  and single people regardless of gender  ethnicity  and age. We also provide a food parcel for school children during the holidays and when it is needed.    The aim of raising funds is also to enable us to provide community-based projects to enable the elderly to engage together meeting their needs for social & personal interaction  in turn hoping to stem the gap of social isolation. We would like to purchase a delivery van to help our volunteers to be able to collect and deliver food donations and parcels.    At the beginning of this current pandemic  we saw the need to provide food  toiletries  and home essential parcels to assist all those who were on furlough and/or were struggling financially. We have delivered meal service to people currently on our books & those that are referred to us from external sources. All food donated are most definitely put to good use in our food parcels  which is a much-needed service and one we are hoping to continue long after the disappearance of the pandemic.    Our main focus is reaching into the community and meeting their current needs and offering hope. Since April 2020 we have delivered over 500 individual food parcels to a wide range of people and organizations within Nottingham. This coming year we would like to build on what we have achieved during last year in reaching our community not with just food parcels but with more practical help in their home and their lives.

I had realised that as a semi-retired person I was pretty much 'alright Jack' under lockdown and wondered if I could do anything to help others. My first idea  on 20 May  had been to go to NHS Strathbrock and play for the amusement of staff and patients. That day I also put my busking hat down with a sign saying ""all proceeds to...."" After securing permission from the police  I decided to put the hat back on my head and start my ""pipe-walks"" around Kirkhill and West End  intending to return to the Strathbrock  of course  and at least three facilities for older residents near me.

We want to provide a place where people who love to cook  but who are unable to do so because of their housing situation  can enjoy cooking healthy balanced meals for themselves and others  which our volunteers can deliver to our clients who are in crisis  many of whom have very specific dietary requirements. Any surplus food will be sold in our community cafe to help fund our work.
