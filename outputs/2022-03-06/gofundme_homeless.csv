I’m currently in a serious situation  I embraced islam a number of years ago  I have one young child and If I don’t raise enough money for rented accommodation I may well become homeless. I hate asking for money but this is my last resort. May Allah reward you for your support and make it a means for you to enter Firdous  ameen. ",False
