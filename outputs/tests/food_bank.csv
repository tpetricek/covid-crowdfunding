We are an ambitious highly focused charity, investing millions of pounds in research right now to find treatments and a cure and to help this generation.
The charity has been formed by the coming together of Joining Jack and Duchenne Children's Trust, the two biggest funders of research in the UK in the last three years. 
We are committed to continuing to drive momentum to deliver treatments to help this generation of those with DMD.
Please visit our website at www.duchenneuk.org.
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a desperately cruel muscle wasting disease that mainly affects boys. It’s the most common fatal genetic disease to affect children. It is 100% fatal and boys die in their early 20s. There are no treatments and no cure. But thanks to recent breakthroughs and with your help, we can save them.
There are lots of ways up can help us. Make a donation on this page, create your own event, or visit the campaigns and events sections to find out about our latest events - and then please join us.

Runnymede Foodbank is part of a UK-wide network of Trussell Trust food banks providing emergency food to people in crisis nationwide.
We cover Runnymede district and the surrounding area to provide a minimum of three days emergency food and support to people experiencing crisis. 
We aim to help people in a crisis by providing food, emotional support and signposting to other services as appropriate, and in doing so, help the person or family deal with the situation they are in more effectively. 
People are referred to Runnymede Foodbank by the agencies working with people in need. This could be Social Workers, Health Visitors, GP’s, Schools, Citizen Advice Bureau and many of the voluntary organisations working in the area. The food (all long life) is generously donated by local people at supermarket collections, Churches, schools and local businesses. 
We serve people of all faith groups and beliefs or none. We are passionate about inclusion and being non-judgemental is central to what we do. We believe that everyone has the right to have food on their plate, dignity and hope for the future. 
The Foodbank would not be able to function without a fabulous team of volunteers who sort the stock, provide a welcoming face to those in need and take part in supermarket collections and other community events.","Beacon Church,95-99 Guildford Street  Chertsey,  KT16 9AS",18/03/2020,19/04/2020

Coronavirus is having a massive impact on all aspects of our lives - and as a charity, Project Trust is no exception. 
Our first response and priority was to urgently repatriate our 2019/20 Volunteers. This was a major challenge undertaken in unprecedented circumstances, achieved through hard work, collaboration and decisive action.
Now, our priority is to secure Project Trust's future.
The costs of repatriation and some of the extraordinary lengths to which we went to secure the safe return of our young people, combined with uncertainty due to the impact of the Coronavirus, is significantly impacting on our work. 
Project Trust’s future is threatened and we need your help. We are appealing to the whole Project Trust Family for all the support and donations you can give.
Your Best Year 
Project Trust is in it's 53rd year, which in itself is impressive. But our real successes lie in the impact on the overseas Communities in which our Volunteers live and work, the personal development of Volunteers, and the many ways in which Returned Volunteers have then applied their experiences to everyday life.
Society has never needed globally-aware young people with an empathy and understanding for cultures and peoples more than it does right now. Safeguarding Project Trust’s future together will allow future generations of young people to experience unique overseas opportunities we have offered across 67 countries since 1967.
That is why doing Project Trust is an adventure like no other. And that is why we know how much you care about Project Trust and how much you, whether as a Volunteer, Parent or Friend value the experiences on offer. 

With that in mind, please give generously.

FORCE Cancer Charity is based in Exeter. FORCE (Friends of the Oncology and Radiotherapy Centre, Exeter) believes that anyone affected by cancer deserves the best possible treatment and professional support, close to home and face-to-face.
Since 1987 the charity has been funding local research and buying equipment to improve patient care at the Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital.
In 2004 FORCE opened a Cancer Support and Information Centre in the grounds of the RD&E. The Centre is open every weekday 9:30-4:30 (Wednesdays 6:30), except Bank Holidays, for people needing physical, emotional, psychological and practical support at a difficult time in their lives. The Centre receives around 25,000 visits a year with patients, their families, carers and friends all able to access support. It has a well-stocked library and information nurses are always on hand to help with questions and offer advice. There are counselling services for individuals and within support groups, including for children and young people, plus complementary therapies, exercise guidance, relaxation and mindfulness sessions, a benefits advice service, help to cope with hair loss and a wig fitting service.
FORCE also offers support and information sessions once a week in Okehampton, Tiverton and Honiton. The charity also funds the delivery of chemotherapy in all three towns.

All of FORCE’s services are free of charge.
Since the charity was founded it has spent well over £8million on support, equipment and research. FORCE receives no Government or NHS funding. FORCE needs to raise £1.7million every year to maintain the services it offers. That money comes entirely from voluntary contributions - legacies, donations, the FORCE charity shop and from fundraising events. Fantastic support from the community it serves enables FORCE to fulfil its mission to support anyone locally affected by cancer.

I decided to do some fundraising by collecting sponsorship for completing the ‘Go Ape’ tree top course at Leeds castle.  This was a challenge as the height was well out of my comfort zone but the generous sponsorship and encouragement from friends, family and acquaintances ensured that I made it round.

EFP operates 7 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme.
Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances.
Each food pack provides at least three meals for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave).
In 2018-19, we provided 11,495 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 19.6% increase on the previous year.
We were able to do so by receiving 130,000kg of food from public donations.
Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps.
Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres. 
Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.

We operate through our sister organisation, Spotlight on Africa-Uganda Foundation which is run by Ugandans. We serve an impoverished community in the sub-county of Bukasakya near the town of Mbale, in Eastern Uganda. Bukasakya is a slum area of around 30,000 people.
Because we are all volunteers in the UK, at least 95p in the pound goes out to Uganda. That's worth £1.20 with Gift Aid. Every penny you donate goes a very long way. 
We believe that the most effective way of lifting a community out of poverty is to address their basic needs in an integrated way and with active local involvement. That is why we focus on four key areas: education, clean water, health and economic development. This is not a common model but one that is regarded highly by the local government officials and community leaders whom we meet during our visits.
When we started in 2006 there were some 60 students at our school in Musoto (a slum village in Bukasakya sub-county). Today we are educating close to 1,000 students. We’ve had 100% pass rate in the primary leaving examinations for the last 3 years and it is now the best performing school in the sub-county. 
In 2006, water-coverage in the area was 25%. Today it is 80%  because we have drilled 24 new boreholes and water springs to provide clean water. 
In the absence of organised healthcare we’ve funded a government based ‘Village Health Team’ (VHT) programme and have trained more than 250 men and women to give practical health advice to their villages on everything from hand washing to malaria control and HIV/Aids. They are one of the most active VHT in the Mbale District. A tangible outcome of these two initiatives is that there have been no deaths from cholera in the sub-county over the last few years. Our efforts on health and sanitation in the area were recognised (along with the likes of World Vision and Malaria Consortium) in a UN sponsored report on VHTs in Uganda.
We've set up economic development schemes to give communities a means of generating income. We've established a fish farm that generates money and provides a source of food, donated 50 goats to widows and orphans that have provided milk, fertiliser and produce to sell at the local market. We've collaborated with Rothamsted Research to increase agricultural yields and set up village savings schemes which also provide micro loans at affordable rates.
 Our impact over the last 10 years has been astonishing. But the need is still great and we know we can continue to make a lasting diference with more funding. ","102 Station Road,  Harpenden,Hertfordshire  AL5 4TU",26/11/2019,14/04/2020
