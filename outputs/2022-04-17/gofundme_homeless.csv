campaign was set up at the onset of Covid-19 in March 2020. Prior to that we were a small organisation doing a handful of events each winter. Since March 2020 we have been supporting our homeless friends on the streets of London and Brighton daily. In that period we have served our homeless friends more than 75 000 times.    The projection is that homelessness will continue to rise in the economic aftermath of the pandemic and as temporary protective measures such as the eviction ban comes to an end.    Our focus is making those affected by homeless feel seen  heard and cared for. Our teams walk the streets and connect with people where they have made “home” for that moment. We provide food  clothing  toiletries  sleeping bags  mobile phones  emergency accommodation and the like.    Through our interactions we get an understanding of individual challenges and attempt to find solutions. We go the extra mile. Examples include sourcing wheelchairs  train tickets to reconnect homeless friends with family or sourcing bicycles to enable uptake of delivery jobs. We have assisted several people out of homelessness.    Under One Sky is a collective of more than 1000 private individuals. Nobody is employed by Under One Sky. Our work is 100% volunteer based. Under One Sky was founded in 2012 and had since then supported 4000 homeless friends until the first lockdown in March 2020. By the end of 2020 that figure will has exploded to 50 000 (lockdown video).    Uses of funds for 2019 Dec to 2020 Dec: £190 000 spent / 200+ outreach events / 43 500 served / £4.4 cost per serving. Items provided includes food  drink  clothing  sleeping bags  toiletries  £30 gift cards to Argos  mobile phones  train tickets and emergency shelter.    Our teams are that light in the darkness for all those who remain abandoned on the streets. We meet people affected by homelessness in a spirit of compassion and have established many personal friendships out there. Our aim is to make everybody feel they belong in this world and to let them know they have not been forgotten.    If you are not able to donate  then we would love for you to share our campaign using the “Share” button (below the “Donate Now” button) or using this link: www.gofundme.com/f/underonesky-homelessaid2020    It is also possible to support by donating sleeping bags using our Amazon Wish list    Finally  you are welcome to send us a message for us to share with the homeless – simply contact us on this page.     “At least we are under the same sky – you and I.” Ranata Suzuki        ",False

The rate of people seeking help from homelessness charities is increasing year on year.     People become homeless for lots of different reasons  including a lack of affordable housing  poverty and unemployment.

Nearly all cases of homelessness are preventable  and every case can be ended  with the right funding and support.     in 2021 over 227 000 families were experiencing homelessness  including 126 000 children. It is estimated that 1 in 96 people are homeless in the West Midlands.
