Last November as Manchester entered lockdown restrictions local foodbanks came under increasing pressure and seen a huge increase in the need of food support. At the time I decided to embark on a wee running challenge to help raise some much needed funds for the Manchester South Central Foodbank.   One year on and food banks are again gearing up for another surge in demand as the most vulnerable people are plunged into further poverty due to the end of the furlough scheme  steep rises in energy bills and the recent cuts to Universal Credit.  Last year we raised over ¬£7000 running 10km a day for 30 days straight..  This year I‚Äôm gonna up the ante and ‚Äòattempt‚Äô to run 15km everyday in November.  Thats 105km a week..   450km over the month..   That‚Äôs an extra 35km a week and 150km across the month compared to last year!   If we can raise even a fraction of the money we did last year it will be more than worth it!! Any funds raised will help massively towards the pressures over the Christmas period and will help those most in need.  All donations no matter how small will be deeply appreciated and will go a long way.  Also  any runners out there hit me up! I‚Äôll need some support & encouragement to stay on track!  And we‚Äôre off.. ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",False

We use the van each week to collect and deliver donated essential furniture such as beds and cookers to people in need. Without a working van  our ability to help people most in need across Wells and the surrounding villages will be more limited.   Demand for help from Wells Vineyard Foodbank & Furniture Storehouse has risen 6-fold during the pandemic. This year alone  over 60 000 meals have been distributed in our area. People are referred by support agencies  GPs and schools and will receive a food box with approximately 4 days worth of food with 3 meals a day plus toiletries. The Furniture Storehouse recycles donated furniture  stores it and distributes it free upon referral. A van is critical to helping us function efficiently across our rural region.   We already have a third of the money we need to buy a van  but need your help to make this happen! You can make a difference by donating today to WELLS VINEYARD CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP.     ",False

Mine (and your) contribution last year was ¬£275 which I am so grateful for - but it would be amazing to beat that this year!!

Telephone & internet system: ¬£20 per month. This is for our landline number for people to get in touch with us.  Petrol: ¬£100 a month to help with volunteers cars.   Waste collection: ¬£20 a month   Portaloo: ¬£25 a week plus vat - we need to get one down yard so we have two toilets on site.   Insurance: ¬£110 a month.   Other costs: around ¬£300 monthly this could be things like topping up first aid box  topping up equipment on the bus or carrying out dbs checks.   These are our main costs we need to cover every month just to run if you could please make a donation and share.   You can see what we do on our Facebook page Norwich Homeless Support.       ",False

I am trying to raise funds  just a small amount  to help 2 friends who are expecting a baby to get by until their benefits are sorted out!   The young couple in question would help anyone in the best way they could  but they now need just a little bit of help themselves! I am going to keep their names to myself so as to not cause them any embarrassment  not that they should feel any  a lot of us have been in similar situations. I will refer to them as R (female) & A (Male). Due to severe illness  and being 31 weeks pregnant  R is unable to work at present  and A is her carer.   Unfortunately they have hit hard times  getting a little behind with things  and have recently been going without food and heating due to lack of accessible funds. At present they are awaiting benefits decisions which as a lot of people know can sometimes take weeks  even months. They have tried everything to speed things along  have been refused help from the council where they live  citizens advice bureau told them there was nothing they can do but wait  and the food bank only allows a household to visit for supplies 1 a month! They have electricity  but no gas for heating  they have no food in and have been surviving on little bits they have managed to acquire here and there. They have no immediate family that can help either! Needless to say all of the stress is affecting R's health even further  physically and mentally  and is also putting the baby at risk!!   I have loaned them a little personally  until they can afford to repay it  but it wasn't much  they are worrying about that too even though I have told them not to and I'm in no rush  but their situation is worsening day by day!   Please could you find it in your hearts to help them get past this rough patch and back on their feet by donating just a small amount towards helping a wonderful young couple pull through their tough time! I would sincerely appreciate any donation  however small! All moneys will be transferred straight to their account to help them purchase food  gas & other essential items! Thanks",False

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.    All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.    If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free. Thankyou for your support.    The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need  providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.    All the best    Jack Monroe.

GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw Since We Care was launched as the UK's largest independent food bank and advice and support hub in Lewisham in 2014  we have always ensured that  during school holidays and Christmas  children and the hungry families they come from do not have to worry about putting food on the table. This half term  however  and over this coming Christmas  we truly need your help to feed the new wave of people and pets from across London who are in crisis and will be coming through our doors this winter at Kath's Place  50 Friendly Street  Deptford SE8 4DR.    But this October millions will lose ¬£1040 through the cut to #UniversalCredit people many in low paid work & most already on the breadline not helped by the increasing high cost of rent & rising energy -transport costs .Can you imagine losing up to 20%plus of your monthly income? That is the reality for so many people in the present crisis. Rents are so high in our area that people in work do not have enough cash to pay the rent and  probably for the first time in their lives  are having to trade a visit to their local coffee shop for a visit to the We Care Food Bank and Food Pantry for help  advice  support and solidarity. Embarrased and even ashamed  but even more desperate and distraught that their kids are going hungry  mums tell us that they can go days without food  and  on average  it takes people at least a week of going hungry before they finally come through our doors and ask for help. We really do need your donation this Christmas GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw . Becasue we help everyone and anyone and do not focus on one particular group (such as refugees or the homeless) we get absolutely NO national or local government funding or any other type of funding. Anyone and everyone in crisis is welcome at We Care  #homeless #refugees #elderly #temporayhousing #lgbtq #bame #disabled #selfemployed #endchildfoodpoverty.

(Please support and please share)    Inchgarth has now launched the second phase of our gofundme campaign to support people during the covid-19 pandemic following your wonderful support during 2020.  We know that for many families  individuals  and businesses that things are extremely tough just now  but for those who may be able to donate a couple of pounds  then we would be hugely grateful for your support that will allow us to help those most in need.    People can donate directly via this gofundme appeal page  or if you prefer  we can accept donations of non perishable food items directly at the centre Monday to Friday 10am-5pm.    Over the last 12 months your support and wonderful donations have not only helped to sustain our organisation  but it's helped a tremendous amount of families and individuals in their greatest hour of need  and your support really has made a massive impact on their lives.    Our support project  which the foodbank is one stand of  is helping not only people in Garthdee  but 14 other communities in Aberdeen south  while we are helping many organisations to support their clients too. The need is real  the need is genuine  and every penny of your support sustains and supports.    No matter how small your donation may be  whether it's one pound  or one tin of food  it's hugely appreciated and makes a difference and we are hugely grateful  as are those benefitting from your generosity.     Thank you for all of the support during 2020  it's been amazing  and now in 2021 we strive to ensure no one slips through the net with your support.  THANK YOU FROM TEAM INCHGARTH.        ",False

times of the year for lots of people. Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don‚Äôt go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland.

This support started when there was no halal food support in the local area of Sharrow and Netheredge and people were struggling to buy basic food for themselves. Due to a gap in the area and a desperate need TSY collaborated with few others to collectively reach out to the most vulnerable including single parents  elderly  self isolating and hardship such as loss of income. All our work is voluntary and since March kind donations from local community has assisted us in making sure no one struggled alone. We are running low on cash donations to purchase food to continue this vital support and are reaching out to anyone who can support us by using this link and donating whatever little they can towards the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank project. Due to the level of need and referrals coming in since the start of this halal foodbank  we have called it Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank to avoid any barriers to any non-muslim vulnerable that maybe in need of this support.

This campaign has now ended.     .....................................    This Christmas we want to give the gift of dignity.    At our foodbank in Brent  north west London  we receive lots of pre-wrapped toys and presents to share. We appreciate the generosity and kindness behind this. This year  everything is a bit different.     We would like to give people needing the foodbank a gift voucher to use just as they wish. To buy something they really need. And especially for parents - to be able to buy the gifts that their kids are wishing for.     Do you want to help? Rather than donating a wrapped gift this year  please contribute to our campaign. We will use all money raised to buy gift vouchers from Argos and B&M  and distribute these to people using the foodbank in time for Christmas. We would love your support!

This year  as we find ourselves in a 3rd lockdown as a country  we have found the number of children whose families are in need of help from Taff-Ely Foodbank  has almost tripled!Our main driver behind this is  how can we help to provide educational material to children when their parents cannot afford to put food on the table  or pay for basic neccessities that we would take forgranted like gas  electric and broadband providers.    That's why  this year we are going bigger than ever! Our aim is to raise ¬£10 000 to provide atleast 2 books for all 1400 children  whose families receive support from the foodbank. They should NOT be at a disadvantage because of circumstances that are beyond their control. Every child has the right to a quality education  and not even a pandemic will hinder our efforts to ensure that this happens within our local area! ",False

Unlike some larger foodbanks we are geared towards street homeless customers and vulnerable people who do not necessarily have the means to store and prepare food.    We have been running a regular foodbank from the front door of the church since March and the beginning of the first lockdown. As other day centres etc have been able to reopen their doors we have slightly pared back our provision to weekly sessions where hot drinks and hot breakfasts are provided along with the opportunity for pastoral or casework support.     In the nearly nine months since we started doing this our regular customers have shared their stories  their problems and shared a joke and I would really like to bring a little festive cheer at a time that can be very hard for anyone to spend alone let alone our homeless and most vulnerable.    In addition to omelettes and bacon rolls etc I'd like to sort out some non-alcoholic mulled wine  some mince pies and stock of good quality socks  hats and gloves.

It is more important than ever that we work together to support one another. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund has launched to provide support to those most at need in our community. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund Right now many of us are understandably feeling anxious and vulnerable  but there are many among us that need immediate support in order to ensure that they can have access to food. Greenwich residents have a proud history of looking after one another - and never has this been more important than now. So I have been working with Greenwich Food Bank to create the Greenwich Food Bank Fund. As the borough faces one of its most important challenges in living memory  the Fund has been set up to ensure that those in need across the borough have access to the help they need. Please  even during this most difficult of times  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Greenwich. Please be assured that even the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference. Thank you for your generosity. FAQs Where will the funds go? The funds will go directly to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by the Greenwich Food Bank and delivered to food banks across the borough  from Blackheath to Eltham  Kidbrooke  Thamesmead and beyond. A full list of food bank locations is available at https://greenwich.foodbank.org.uk/locations/. If I donate will it go directly to those who need it? Yes  your donation will go directly to Greenwich Food Bank. Unlike some other platforms  GoFundMe does not charge a fundraising fee although it takes a small transaction fee. See https://www.gofundme.com/c/free-fundraising for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to. Will the money be spent in Greenwich? Yes. Is there anything else I can do? The most immediate need is to raise finance  so that purchasing can continue. However there is also a need to: (1) donate food where possible; and (2) create a team of delivery drivers as the Food Bank moves to a delivery model. If you are able to help with either of these  please email [email redacted].uk. Where can I find more information about Covid-19? For general information on CV-19  please visit the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response or the NHS at https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/.

Food donations are always most welcome  but they are sometimes not practical for people  while cash donations are a great help  as they mean not only we can buy in particular items when we run short of them   to help make up balanced parcels  they also act as a much-needed fall-back fund when food donations are low  so we can still maintain our service every week.    If you do choose to donate to this fundraiser  please accept our deepest thanks and gratitude  on behalf of ourselves and all the people we help. If you decide not to  then thanks for looking anyway.    Stay safe and well everybody. XXX    Facebook link: https://www.facebook.com/leylandfoodbank/",False

I was born in Nigeria and moved to the UK in 2004 to study. I finished my Masters in 2014 and am currently living in the North West area of Merseyside. I have previously worked for Foodbank as a volunteer during the pandemic helping homeless people  migrants  and other vulnerable people.    Situation?    I have always worked and paid my living expenses when I had a student visa. However  because of the hostile environment policy and UK‚Äôs draconian immigration system  I do not have permission to work  and I have no recourse to public funds (NRPF)  meaning that I have no access to housing support and benefits. As a result  I have been couch surfing and relying on the kindness of friends to stop me from being street homeless. I am also struggling with prediabetes and need proper nutrition and diet to avoid my situation getting worse.    What‚Äôs the plan?

Wycombe Food Hub (WFH) came about at the start of lockdown. We collected residual food from leading supermarkets. Our products are often short dated ‚ÄòBest Before End‚Äô (BBE) dates. These products are still usable. The range varies on what we source each week from our partners. We are collecting over 200 green crates each week.   We supply products to people unable to access or buy food  those that cannot get Government aid or are unable to survive on the Government‚Äôs benefit payments  those who are now suffering from loss of jobs and the self-employed who can‚Äôt get benefits  those who cannot access the traditional referral foodbanks.   The range of people coming to us for help is growing weekly. Considering what‚Äôs happening nationally the need for our food and services will continue to grow.    We are now collecting from even more supermarkets  allotments and farms    We have now secured a retail shop in the centre of High Wycombe. The shop is open 5 days a week   The shop allows us to distribute not only residual food but also offer chilled and frozen food.     Partner organisations are now working with us to signpost and help those needing more care and referral to statutory authorities.     Moving into a retail premises has now incurred us some long-term financial liabilities and we need to reach out for help   We are fundraising for building  building refurb  building repairs  building insurance  equipment and software  electricity and utilities  print and collateral .     We started with a zero funding stream. We have managed to secure some small grants and donations from friendly benefactors  which has allowed us to deliver to the stage we are now .     We now need to fundraise to be able to grow and continue to deliver services. If residents and businesses are able to help we would be grateful    The big thing we now need is a multi temperature van",False

15/2020-09-23 200","The Great Oven has been building giant community ovens and sending them to places of need for over two years ‚Äì to refugee camps  war-torn communities  and now inner cities in crisis.     Born in Tripoli  Northern Lebanon and operating in refugee camps in the Bekaa Valley throughout the COVID pandemic  we are now responding to the Beirut blast.     With the full endorsement of the Lebanese Foodbank  each of our ovens is capable of producing over 1 000 meals per day. Our plan is to greatly increase this reach by expanding our number of oven sites nationwide.     Our Work To Date    Today  the Great Oven HQ is located next to the epicenter of the blast site  in Lebanon‚Äôs most respected nightclub of all places  the Ballroom Blitz. Each day  between 10 - 20 local volunteers contribute to the preparation of meals and supplies which are then distributed to our oven sites.     Over a month on from the blast  with media fatigue setting in and many temporary relief efforts already withdrawing  our work is crucial. We believe that responses to Lebanon‚Äôs escalating crisis must be long term in their vision and center the Lebanese people as agents of their own reconstruction and resilience-building process.    By its very nature  The Great Oven is uniquely positioned to provide assistance through this framework. Not only do we set up enduring networks but our ovens are permanent installations that belong to the communities in which they are based. As centres for cooking  teaching and sharing a meal  our ovens facilitate a creative and participatory experience that brings communities together and fosters social cohesion.     Where will your support go?    The Great Oven has self-funded its operations for over two years. We are proud of our self-sustainability but now feel it is time to grow. We can‚Äôt do this without your support.    Each kind donation will be used to fund our basic operational costs  all of which are listed below:    - Production and installation of more community ovens in areas of critical need in Beirut and nationwide  - Sourcing local food produce for each oven  - Distribution of food beyond Great Oven sites across the city  - Oven transport and logistics     Our only paid salaries to date  go to marginalised people we founded our movement with. This includes LGBTQ refugees  stateless youths  trafficked women  and ex child fighters to name a few.     More about the Great Oven    We build great big beautiful ovens to feed a great number of people.     But the oven is also symbolic. It represents our belief that the ritual of cooking and sharing meals helps bring communities together  whatever their faith  ethnicity or gender.     We also believe in the rehabilitative power of music and art to restore faith that a better future is possible.     What we offer is not aid in the traditional sense  but the participatory tools to empower a community to build that future for themselves  and with those tools comes an inherent sense of dignity  which is as important as food relief in nourishing a marginalised community.     We work with grassroots  on-the-ground  local initiatives and organisers in order to respond organically and effectively to each community‚Äôs unique needs.     What we‚Äôre offering in return     The Great Oven was founded by award-winning cook  documentary filmmaker and philanthropist  James Thompson. Our wider team is a collective of chefs  artists and creative thinkers dedicated to making positive change through food and art.     We are eternally grateful for any donation  no matter how big or small. For any substantial contributions  we would like to offer a very special thank you in true Great Oven style:    Donations of ¬£1 000 or more    A private Great Oven feast cooked by Great Oven chefs (and special guests) at your home.    Donations of ¬£250 or more    A seat at a one-off Great Oven community feast in one of the following locations:    Barcelona  Beirut  Berlin  Denver  Dublin  Glastonbury  Johannesburg  Kuala Lumpur  Kinsale  London  Mexico City  Mumbai  New York   Valencia    These feasts will feature several special guests of the culinary  music and art worlds. These feasts will be scheduled to take place when COVID-19 restrictions soften. In the meantime  your name will be added to the guestlist for the feast in your selected city.    Thank you in advance for your kind support. Your generosity means the world to us and to the people of Lebanon. ",False

We need your help to continue to provide for all those in need of support just now.    Since Lockdown in March 2020  the Punjab Restaurant in Covent Garden has been cooking to feed anybody and everybody in need. More than 100 000 hot meals have been provided to homeless organisations; Nishkam SWAT  Gur Seva  Under One Sky and our local church St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square. During the first lock down half the restaurant was converted to HQ  packing and storage facility for Under One Sky. We are doing the same for this second lock down.     Despite business being affected by the pandemic  in our 74 years  the Punjab has never closed its kitchens. MD Amrit Maan has been determined to make the restaurant a community resource to help as many as possible through this difficult moment in history.    All this has been possible with the goodwill of our staff  our own reserves and ability to purchase in bulk  but also from donations of food from businesses that had to close and partnering charities.     Our ""engine"" ‚Äì our kitchen and volunteering staff - is running at full speed  with the Covent Garden community spirit.       BUT we now need your support to purchase raw ingredients and containers to see struggling families and the homeless through the festive period and into January.    Your donations will be used for basic healthy ingredients: potatoes  onions  cauliflower  baked beans  chick peas  red split lentils and rice.     The cost per serving/box is approximately ¬£1.50 and we‚Äôre asking for just 60p towards each serving. We need to serve 1000 meals a week  so our ¬£4800 target will result in 8000 meals to those struggling daily  though we note the need is only increasing.      We‚Äôll be posting regular updates of how your donations are being spent and who it has helped.     It is getting colder every day and we‚Äôre heading towards the festive holidays  which will be a difficult one for so many more this year. Even ¬£2 will provide 3-4 servings.     Please dig deep and help if you can ‚Äì every little counts.",False

We have been operating since 2012 in London and became a charity in March 2020. Information about SWAN can be found on our website www.swanlondon.org. We run a foodbank and provide community support to many Refugee and migrant families in London. We have also been providing aid to refugees in Camp Moria since 2018 in partnership with Kitrinos Healthcare and Team Humanity who are both charities registered to work in Greece. We have collected  sent (via container) and provided vital humanitarian aid to Refugees in Moria camp including food parcels  baby milk  nappies  clothes  shoes and blankets and documented the distributions on social media (WhatsApp). Team Humanity are our implementing partner on the ground and they have distributed regular food parcels to new arrivals on our behalf. In recent months there has been a dramatic increase in the number of new arrivals and conditions are horrendous. Many families are living in inhumane conditions with little or new food. Since November 2019 SWAN - with the help of TEAM HUMANITY has been providing bread (which is prepared by Refugees) in the camp to starving refugees in and outside Moria Camp. The cost of preparing each bread is 40 cents. ‚Ç¨400 provides 1000 breads. There are currently 21 000+ refugees in Moria and many new arrivals have no funds and the queues are so long for the food provided by the Greek authorities and local charities that many get nothing. All funds received for this campaign will be sent to our implementing partner Team Humanity to pay for preparation and distribution of the bread. The ground team send pictures of each distribution to SWAN which we share with donors for transparency. The bread we distribute is often all they will eat.

As a result of the partnerships which have been made we have been able to supply food parcels for up to 100 families a week at times  this does not account for the number of people who come to collect food items at the church and these are separate to the Foodbank referrals. The contacts for the food parcels have come through various schools  individuals and other groups. We have also arranged the purchase and packing of around 50 fresh fruit and vegetable parcels for the local food bank each week. Since the start of Covid we have produced over 1250 food parcels between the Wokingham Community Hub  the Foodbank and direct contacts.    The majority of the items we have are donated however with the financial donations we receive we are able to put this back into the project and purchase items that we require. Share- Wokingham has been open daily to anyone who can come along to Norreys Church  offering bakery items and any other surplus food stock we have ‚Äì there is no charge for this but if people are able to make a donation  however small  it is always appreciated. This means it does not carry the stigma attached to going to the Foodbank as people are not just being able to feed themselves for little to no money but they are also having an environmental impact in tackling the waste issue.    As the pandemic has continued the needs of those that we support have changed  initially it was people who were shielding and unable to get out and now we are really seeing the economic impact  job losses and financial woes have meant that people are struggling - that is where we can support.",False

In Pakistan  approximately 53 000 children die consequential to waterborne diseases from consuming contaminated water. Water filtration plants work via a complex technology incorporating chemical  biological  physical processes to eliminate toxins and pollutants infecting water. One filtration plant will cost approx ¬£2000  hence due to financial restraints there is often a struggle to implement them on a wider scale in Pakistan. At this moment  our current funds can only stretch to provide for one water filtration plant  which we are in the process of building. This will be located at a mosque so that those in it‚Äôs close proximity may enjoy the basic necessity and gift of water. We aim to attend to those in dire need and inshallah with the help of your donations we intend to increase our production and build two more water filtration plants so more communities may quench their thirst with water that won‚Äôt kill them. Our goal will be ¬£4000  to be realistic  so to build two filtration plants that will provide to large and suffering communities. If we exceed this amount we can build more inshallah! This Ramadan  your donation could help gift not only water to an entire community but a sustainable system of access to water. Which would mean that a continual amount of clean water can be supplied to local residents for generations to come.Donations can be made in your name  a loved ones name or as sadaqa jariya for one who is no longer with us. On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him)  who said that the Messenger of Allah (Ô∑∫) said:Allah SWT will say on the Day of Resurrection:‚ÄúO son of Adam  I asked you to give Me to drink and you gave Me not to drink. He will say: O Lord  how should I give You to drink when You are the Lord of the worlds? He will say: My servant So-and-so asked you to give him to drink and you gave him not to drink. Had you given him to drink you would have surely found that with Me.‚Äù Our brothers and sisters need us...let us fulfil our duties as an ummah. Not to mention increase our rewards and our station in the sight of Allah Azzawajal.May Allah reward us all for our efforts! ",False

It‚Äôs crazy how the pandemic we currently living in has caused all kinds of financial difficulties situations & families have had no choice but to turn to the food banks for help & assistance. I know that raising money will help the foodbank buy essential food. It saddens me to see how the numbers have doubled as more people are being impacted by covid with job losses and furlough leaving families struggling to find money to buy enough food .We have all seen the headlines regarding school meals but it's easy to forget for a lot of these children that is the only balanced meal they will get .  In the first six months of the pandemic  food banks in the trussell trust network gave out a staggering 1.2 million emergency food parcels   . That‚Äôs one food parcel every 13 seconds  and 2 600 of these went to children every day on average.  I decided to walk 2021 km & hopefully get this achieved within 10 months. So if you see me walking please give me a cheer and some motivational comments.   So I'm looking for your support Every penny helps put food on the table and allowing families to try not stress financially or have to choose between food and heating .So please consider donating to my sponsorship link below     TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE",False
