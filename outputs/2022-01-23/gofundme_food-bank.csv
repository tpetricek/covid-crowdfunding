Last November as Manchester entered lockdown restrictions local foodbanks came under increasing pressure and seen a huge increase in the need of food support. At the time I decided to embark on a wee running challenge to help raise some much needed funds for the Manchester South Central Foodbank.   One year on and food banks are again gearing up for another surge in demand as the most vulnerable people are plunged into further poverty due to the end of the furlough scheme  steep rises in energy bills and the recent cuts to Universal Credit.  Last year we raised over £7000 running 10km a day for 30 days straight..  This year I’m gonna up the ante and ‘attempt’ to run 15km everyday in November.  Thats 105km a week..   450km over the month..   That’s an extra 35km a week and 150km across the month compared to last year!   If we can raise even a fraction of the money we did last year it will be more than worth it!! Any funds raised will help massively towards the pressures over the Christmas period and will help those most in need.  All donations no matter how small will be deeply appreciated and will go a long way.  Also  any runners out there hit me up! I’ll need some support & encouragement to stay on track!  And we’re off.. ‍♂️",False

Last year as a group we raised a whopping £3 000 !! Which was a massive increase on 2019. This year we are looking to smash that record again - with your help!!  Mine (and your) contribution last year was £275 which I am so grateful for - but it would be amazing to beat that this year!!    We are just a group of friends who raise money every year in the run up to Christmas to buy food for local food banks around the South Birmingham area.   Now more than ever  your donations and support will mean so much more.  COVID has caused complications and tough situations for everybody  some more than others. Food banks were crying out for food to support local communities last year and this year is no different!!    Any and all donations are hugely appreciated and will go directly to purchasing food and non-perishables requested by the local food banks!!    Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you in advance for your generous donation - you have made a massive difference!!",False

Even though this year has been mad for everyone there is still a lot of people who do not have the support & luxuries that most of us probably take for granted.  Sadly we are still live in a world where people and their families need your support. So again for this Christmas I will be doing a collection for Waterlooville food bank. I will be raising money which will go towards requested gifts for the families or can collect donations of presents/gifts - anything is acceptable!!     If you are in a position to donate anything at all I urge you to do so! It doesn’t have to be much & doesn’t have to be through me  even if over the next couple of weeks you can add a few extra bits to your shopping for your local food bank at a supermarket  anything helps!     So if you have a little extra money to donate this Christmas  I can guarantee there will be someone out there who will really appreciate it!     Please message me if you would like to donate gifts towards this and I’m more than happy to collect any local donations if required!!I will be looking to have donations by the 15th December 2021.",False

We use the van each week to collect and deliver donated essential furniture such as beds and cookers to people in need. Without a working van  our ability to help people most in need across Wells and the surrounding villages will be more limited.   Demand for help from Wells Vineyard Foodbank & Furniture Storehouse has risen 6-fold during the pandemic. This year alone  over 60 000 meals have been distributed in our area. People are referred by support agencies  GPs and schools and will receive a food box with approximately 4 days worth of food with 3 meals a day plus toiletries. The Furniture Storehouse recycles donated furniture  stores it and distributes it free upon referral. A van is critical to helping us function efficiently across our rural region.   We already have a third of the money we need to buy a van  but need your help to make this happen! You can make a difference by donating today to WELLS VINEYARD CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP.     ",False

Just in the last few months we have rehoused 7 people who have come on to the bus and now rehoused in local hostels with one who now has his own room in a shared property and back working full time.     We also run a community food bank which is a vital service for those who need emergency food parcels.     We have proven the bus to work but with winter here our furniture sales have slowed down and we really need some funding in to least cover us for the next few months so we can keep the bus running.     I have put our costs below  all money is spent on keeping our services running.     Unit & storage rent: £500 this is where our bus is parked and also our storage container.   Telephone & internet system: £20 per month. This is for our landline number for people to get in touch with us.  Petrol: £100 a month to help with volunteers cars.   Waste collection: £20 a month   Portaloo: £25 a week plus vat - we need to get one down yard so we have two toilets on site.   Insurance: £110 a month.   Other costs: around £300 monthly this could be things like topping up first aid box  topping up equipment on the bus or carrying out dbs checks.   These are our main costs we need to cover every month just to run if you could please make a donation and share.   You can see what we do on our Facebook page Norwich Homeless Support.       ",False

I am trying to raise funds  just a small amount  to help 2 friends who are expecting a baby to get by until their benefits are sorted out!   The young couple in question would help anyone in the best way they could  but they now need just a little bit of help themselves! I am going to keep their names to myself so as to not cause them any embarrassment  not that they should feel any  a lot of us have been in similar situations. I will refer to them as R (female) & A (Male). Due to severe illness  and being 31 weeks pregnant  R is unable to work at present  and A is her carer.   Unfortunately they have hit hard times  getting a little behind with things  and have recently been going without food and heating due to lack of accessible funds. At present they are awaiting benefits decisions which as a lot of people know can sometimes take weeks  even months. They have tried everything to speed things along  have been refused help from the council where they live  citizens advice bureau told them there was nothing they can do but wait  and the food bank only allows a household to visit for supplies 1 a month! They have electricity  but no gas for heating  they have no food in and have been surviving on little bits they have managed to acquire here and there. They have no immediate family that can help either! Needless to say all of the stress is affecting R's health even further  physically and mentally  and is also putting the baby at risk!!   I have loaned them a little personally  until they can afford to repay it  but it wasn't much  they are worrying about that too even though I have told them not to and I'm in no rush  but their situation is worsening day by day!   Please could you find it in your hearts to help them get past this rough patch and back on their feet by donating just a small amount towards helping a wonderful young couple pull through their tough time! I would sincerely appreciate any donation  however small! All moneys will be transferred straight to their account to help them purchase food  gas & other essential items! Thanks",False
