Covid-19 in March 2020. Prior to that we were a small organisation doing a handful of events each winter. Since March 2020 we have been supporting our homeless friends on the streets of London and Brighton daily. In that period we have served our homeless friends more than 75 000 times.    The projection is that homelessness will continue to rise in the economic aftermath of the pandemic and as temporary protective measures such as the eviction ban comes to an end.    Our focus is making those affected by homeless feel seen  heard and cared for. Our teams walk the streets and connect with people where they have made “home” for that moment. We provide food  clothing  toiletries  sleeping bags  mobile phones  emergency accommodation and the like.    Through our interactions we get an understanding of individual challenges and attempt to find solutions. We go the extra mile. Examples include sourcing wheelchairs  train tickets to reconnect homeless friends with family or sourcing bicycles to enable uptake of delivery jobs. We have assisted several people out of homelessness.    Under One Sky is a collective of more than 1000 private individuals. Nobody is employed by Under One Sky. Our work is 100% volunteer based. Under One Sky was founded in 2012 and had since then supported 4000 homeless friends until the first lockdown in March 2020. By the end of 2020 that figure will has exploded to 50 000 (lockdown video).    Uses of funds for 2019 Dec to 2020 Dec: £190 000 spent / 200+ outreach events / 43 500 served / £4.4 cost per serving. Items provided includes food  drink  clothing  sleeping bags  toiletries  £30 gift cards to Argos  mobile phones  train tickets and emergency shelter.    Our teams are that light in the darkness for all those who remain abandoned on the streets. We meet people affected by homelessness in a spirit of compassion and have established many personal friendships out there. Our aim is to make everybody feel they belong in this world and to let them know they have not been forgotten.    If you are not able to donate  then we would love for you to share our campaign using the “Share” button (below the “Donate Now” button) or using this link: www.gofundme.com/f/underonesky-homelessaid2020    It is also possible to support by donating sleeping bags using our Amazon Wish list    Finally  you are welcome to send us a message for us to share with the homeless – simply contact us on this page.     “At least we are under the same sky – you and I.” Ranata Suzuki        ",False

Just in the last few months we have rehoused 7 people who have come on to the bus and now rehoused in local hostels with one who now has his own room in a shared property and back working full time.     We also run a community food bank which is a vital service for those who need emergency food parcels.     We have proven the bus to work but with winter here our furniture sales have slowed down and we really need some funding in to least cover us for the next few months so we can keep the bus running.     I have put our costs below  all money is spent on keeping our services running.     Unit & storage rent: £500 this is where our bus is parked and also our storage container.   Telephone & internet system: £20 per month. This is for our landline number for people to get in touch with us.  Petrol: £100 a month to help with volunteers cars.   Waste collection: £20 a month   Portaloo: £25 a week plus vat - we need to get one down yard so we have two toilets on site.   Insurance: £110 a month.   Other costs: around £300 monthly this could be things like topping up first aid box  topping up equipment on the bus or carrying out dbs checks.   These are our main costs we need to cover every month just to run if you could please make a donation and share.   You can see what we do on our Facebook page Norwich Homeless Support.       ",False

Trying to study through the last two years of life as it’s known added with transitioning proved too hard and as a result I had failed my studies and this has left me house less and without my guaranteed income of student support.
