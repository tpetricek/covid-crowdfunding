18,,,"The Children's Foundation","Our aim is to improve the health and well-being of children and young people from birth to age 18 in the North East by making serious stuff fun! We want all North East children and young people to be happy and healthy. We want them to feel loved, respected, feel they have a voice and are heard. We achieve this in two ways; Within Child Health Establishments through our; Clown Doctor Project - ensuring vital therapeutic play is received each week by children experiencing distress and anxiety during their treatment and stay in hospital. Activity and entertainment packs – working with the Nurses and Play staff to put together and deliver bespoke packs for children who find themselves staying long term in the Great North Children’s Hospital. Story Chair Project – we fund a story chair and book trolley in Children’s Outpatients so parent/carers/family can read to their child/children while they wait for appointments to help ease worry, anxiety and spend some quality time together. Within communities; through projects such as; Therapeutic Horticulture - establishing accredited gardening projects (City & Guilds Level 1 Practical Horticulture) in secondary schools so support and tuition can be given to disadvantaged young people, those struggling within the classroom environment, those with behavioural issues or those on reduced school timetables or on the verges of exclusion. Food and Fun Activity Packs - providing vulnerbale children and their families with weekend food provision and some activities that encourage family time. Fuzzy Subjects – mental health workshops in primary schools using fuzzy puppets as a tool to engage children and young people in the subject of mental health and well-being, increasing awareness, understanding and resilience in young people. Nurture Project – Providing a safe space after school for isolated and marginalised young people to find a voice, grow in confidence and build positive friendships. Clown Doctors in Hospices - ensuring vital therapeutic play is received by children in respite care.  Couch to 2K - A weekly running group for young people to promote a healthier lifestyle, reduce isolation and improve well-being. Holiday trips and activities - reducing isolation, incresisng confidence and improving well-being through physical trips and activities in the school holidays.",True,2021-09-11,"2021-09-12 100/2021-09-11 10",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=SuzieKitchen&pageUrl=1,2021-09-12,,,110
