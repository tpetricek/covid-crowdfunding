Wycombe Homeless Connection needs our help to make sure there will be help and hope this winter for anyone who needs it.

Locally, efforts to keep everyone in have just ended and more people will need a safe place to stay this winter.

The huge challenge they face is keeping everyone who doesnt have a home off the street, in suitable accommodation, with everything they need to stay healthy and well, while helping them find a more suitable, more permanent home. All this while there continues to be a severe shortage of suitable and affordable homes meaning moving on from emergency accommodation can be incredibly difficult.

The good news is because of your support, WHC can be here to help.

HOLT provide clinics and go out nightly to individuals who are living on the streets to check on their physical and mental health needs. Many of these people are ageing<span>.

During our lunch time my colleagues would take in turn to help me to pick items to make up each shoes box.&nbsp; We set up a production line where some would cut wrapping paper, apply cello-tape and check shoes boxes which were made gender specific. At&nbsp;Christmas 2017 a total of 148 shoes boxes were made and distributed in Berkshire.</p><p><span></span></p><p>As this campaign was so successful I have been running campaigns every year.&nbsp; This will be my 5th year to run this appeal for Homeless. Since the pandemic in 2020, I believe it is ever more important to support the homeless as the number of people that requires support has increased. For 2020 appeal the total donations were raised for the sum of £1,836.25 including gift aid.&nbsp; Also the staff and families of Berkshire Healthcare NHS FT donated:</p><p>30 Bags (sacks) of second clothes</p><p>5 Bags (sacks) of new items including underwear and toiletries.</p><p><span>Your donations would be going to an extremely worthy cause as The HOLT staff are engaging very closely, at a personal level, with people in Berkshire who are homeless. They develop caring relationships with the individuals and build up rapport, human contact and communicate with humour to help support their mental well-being in what are often difficult care conditions. This team sees the damage that isolation brings, especially at times of year which are particularly family centred celebrations.</span><br></p><p>I would kindly ask to please give no matter how small the amount as your donations will make all the difference to the homeless this Christmas. </p><p>Warm Regards – Anita Patel</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p>",0,0,,https://www.justgiving.com/holthomeless,,0,1900,"Anita's Christmas Campaign For The Homeless: Reading & Newbury 2021"

The huge challenge they face is keeping everyone who doesnt have a home off the street, in suitable accommodation, with everything they need to stay healthy and well, while helping them find a more suitable, more permanent home. All this while there continues to be a severe shortage of suitable and affordable homes meaning moving on from emergency accommodation can be incredibly difficult.

Policing is about protecting the vulnerable not sweeping them up like unwanted litter. </p><p>The homeless in Windsor and beyond sleep rough for a variety of reasons, many have found themselves in their position through a crisis in their lives for which they have had little or no choice. What they need is understanding, compassion and support. This government chose to prop up the banking system and pay for it through the slashing of the public sector and welfare support, this is the consequence. The world will be watching Windsor in May, let them see the true nature of Britain not a sanitised version cleansed for international viewing.

In the UK and Republic of Ireland this work includes more than 800 Salvation Army social service centres and community churches.

So I decided to try and do my bit.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a simple idea, the total of all food and<span>&nbsp;</span><u>non-alcoholic</u><span>&nbsp;</span>beverages that enter my mouth each day has to be less than a pound. I'm allowing myself beers because I just can't afford to get any more boring after exam season has finished.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm challenging myself to do this for the 30 days of June, I started on the 1st and all is going well! I'm allowing myself to eat at 2 parties so not to be rude to the host, but that's it!&nbsp;</p><p>Though raising money for Huggard, a homeless shelter in Cardiff, the money should directly&nbsp;help the homeless population of Cardiff. I am also wanting to raise awareness for Hope for the Homeless, a fantastic charity society created and run by<span>&nbsp;Cardiff University students. They are already doing great things to help Cardiff's homeless, but they're only just getting started so they need you to get behind them and support them in continuing to make a difference. So go check out their Facebook page and be sure to follow them to keep up to date with everything they get up<span>&nbsp;</span>to:&nbsp;</span><span>https://www.facebook.com/groups/1647908288595404/</span></p><p><span>I fully understand living like this is not a game, nor a choice, for a lot&nbsp;of the world population. Approximately&nbsp;half of the world population living on less than £2 per day which grips around 700 million people worldwide in a vicious cycle of hunger and malnutrition.</span></p><p>Being hungry means more than just missing a meal. It’s a debilitating crisis and a<span>&nbsp;perilous cycle that passes from one generation to the next: Families who struggle with chronic hunger and malnutrition consistently go without the nutrients their minds and bodies need, which then prevents them from being able to work, go to school, or improve their lives, anchoring them to a life of inescapable poverty.</span></p><p><span>So please donate to help a local cause that I hope will benefit some of the toughest lives in Cardiff. If you can't spare even a few pence, please get behind&nbsp;Hope for the Homeless by getting on their Facebook, following them and sharing them<span>&nbsp;</span>to<span>&nbsp;</span>all you friends.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><br></p>",6,0,,https://www.justgiving.com/Hungry-for-the-Homeless,,190,0,"The One Pound Challenge"

Some aren’t even born over here come over here for a better life with promising potential for life  they have dreamed of . Yet are forced to live on the streets. Some have chosen this path in life addicted to drugs , drink etc. Others have been in and out of care at a young age and have never had real stability and the streets is all that they know . Everyday whilst we all live in this wee bubble of ours of our luxury lifestyle .Most people  walk past these unfortunate people as if they are not there , quite often or not these people for the most of it aren’t after for your money they want acknowledgement they are humans beings like you and I . People are people like you and I regardless of there path in life we all have the same qualities of any other humans thoughts , feelings. <br><br>There is a lot that happens around the world we cannot control. We cannot stop earthquakes, we cannot prevent droughts, and we cannot prevent all conflict, but when we know where the hungry, the homeless and the sick exist, then we can help.<br><br>This Christmas I am raising money for shelter to buy the homeless basic essentials to get them through the winter . <br><br>So please patch your morning Starbucks for one morning and put it to a good cause make a difference because our life is luxury compared to anyone on the street . 👌🏻💪🏻<br></p>",1,0,,https://www.justgiving.com/Jade-Munn,,5,200,"Glasgow homelessness"

We will offer food, supplies and a listening ear and let them know that although they might feel that nobody cares, there are people, like you and us, who do.</p><p>We know you will open your hearts to this worthy cause. You are welcome to donate either money to provide a bed for the night, or you can contribute warm winter coats, sleeping bags or food, which we will give out during the fundraiser.

We were  fortunate to enlist the support from major companies such as Aldi, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons and Marks &amp; Spencer, who have kindly donated supplies of food which we collect  during the day and then distribute to homeless shelters throughout Glasgow, Edinburgh and Lanarkshire in the evenings.",8,8,"2020-11-28 30/2020-11-28 10/2020-11-28 10/2020-11-27 10/2020-11-25 30/2020-11-07 10/2020-10-19 10/2020-10-18 10",https://www.justgiving.com/Matthew-Barr8,2020-11-28,120,500,"HELP US HELP SCOTLAND'S HOMELESS & VULNERABLE "

She sadly left us on the 21st of March 2018. This tragic event happened a few month after a homeless man with beautiful soul playing harmonica in the street had his life taken away this winter.</span></span></p><p><span><span>I regularly talk to homeless people in the street and got to know their stories and situations. Most of them cannot have access to a shelter and are on a waiting list. They also lost their job because they do not have a home address and cannot have a house because they don't have a job. It is a situation with no end. But creating more space in shelters and projects such as a coffee that would employ homeless people could put an end to this situation. It is now time to save their lives.</span></span></p><p><span><span>To contribute to that change I am fundraising for Catching Lives with a song I wrote for the homeless. This song is called Gold. Gold because we should not see homeless people as vulnerable or inferior but as beautiful individuals with a soul of Gold. Homeless people deserve a life, a smile and love. They are our brothers and sisters. The lyrics of the song says ""my tears have turned to gold"" because no matter how much money a person may have everyone has a treasure of gold inside. Homeless people have gold in their heart and amazing talents but it is now time to see it and look beyond appearance. Everyone has a story behind their eyes.</span></span></p><p><span><span>You can download the song Gold just below and you can give as much or as little as you want ;)</span></span></p><p><span></span></p><p></p><p>https://soundcloud.com/flyer-tischa/gold</p><div><br></div><div>If you want to see the live video clip:&nbsp;https://youtu.be/hpBWP4b2C3Q<p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p></div>",0,0,,https://www.justgiving.com/tischakent,,0,200,"Song for the homeless"

Covid-19 has presented us with challenges and we had to carefully rethink our approach to Harvest. Transporting multiple items from homes, to schools and churches and then on to our projects inevitably increases the risk of infection.

Financial donations will enable us to purchase essential items according to need and, crucially, plan carefully to provide enough food for our clients for the full year ahead. The donations will also enable us to buy fresh produce which supports better health and immunity at this critical time.

,,,1017504,"Forever Manchester",True,2018-10-15,"I am raising money for 'Real Change Wigan &amp; Leigh' to helps end and prevent homelessness for people in Wigan and Leigh.

We can all see the impact homelessness is having in Wigan and Leigh. Whether rough sleeping, begging or sofa surfing, people who are homeless have poorer health, are more vulnerable to violence or abuse, and can often struggle to keep a job or stay in touch with their family. 

Real Change Wigan &amp; Leigh is a partnership of charities and groups working to end homelessness alongside people with direct experience. 

Too often, the barrier is people's lack of access to the simple things we might all take for granted: money for a rent deposit, clothes for a job interview, or even a bus ticket to get to their new accommodation. 'Real Change Wigan and Leigh' need your help to provide practical items like these. 

Donate now to help end homelessness in Wigan &amp; Leigh.

So they are in need for wrapped foods such as bottled water, biscuits, crisps, cereal bars. We've been given a target to make 30 parcels.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>2.

Some facing serious danger on the streets. Without the right help at the right time, this downward spiral lasts through adulthood.



But there’s still hope. With the right opportunities and support, homeless young people can turn their lives around and build successful futures, which, along with End Youth Homelessness, we're challenging you to SLEEP OUT (or sleep in) to raise awareness and vital funds to help vulnerable young people find a safe, secure place to call home.



Never before have small, individual actions been so powerful. Let’s join forces to end youth homelessness and give young people a brighter future.

Even before COVID-19 arrived most of the people in our care were vulnerable and often isolated from mainstream society. The pandemic made their situation even more stressful and, in many cases, riskier. This was especially true for those without a home, experiencing domestic abuse, struggling with addiction and/or mental health issues. 

The pandemic has also had a devastating effect on Julian Houses voluntary income at a time when the demand for our services has increased. With fundraising events being cancelled and our charity shops and bike workshops having to close temporarily, our voluntary income as taken a significant blow.

,,,292411,Centrepoint,False,2018-12-13,"<p>A MASSIVE THANKYOU!</p><p>I am thrilled to confirm that on the evening of December 25th Wander Woman officially walked the wall!</p><p>While most people were tucking into turkey and roast potatoes this festive season, I was dressed as 'Wander Woman' walking 100 miles from one side of England to the other to raise awareness and money for youth homeless chartiy Centrepoint.</p><p>I started with a visit to Centrepoint's northernmost office and drop-in centre in Sunderland on the shortest day (and longest night) and walked up to Newcastle on 22nd, then across England, following Hadrian's Wall, ending in Cumbria at Bowness-on-Solway late in the evening on Christmas Day.<br></p><p>I'm know for choosing to sleep in 'wild' locations as an adventurer, but this was my toughest challenge yet. That's because you can't wild camp on the wall - it's illegal, so I had to walk steadily through the night, in cold and dark conditions, by myself, with only short stops to 'rest' - all the while in costume. <br></p><p>It meant I missed out on on the festivities with my friends and family, but I think it was worth it to highlight the plight of many thousands of young homeless people who also have to keep moving through the night, unable to sleep anywhere legally and safely.</p><p>I was lucky enough to have an end date to my challenge, but there are so many who don't. Their walk must seem endless, and such it would be were it not for Centrepoint who work tirelessly to not only house them but also support them to get any education, life skills and the services of mental health professionals that they might need. <br></p><p>Last year over 100,000 young people approached their local council for help with homelessness, meaning that every mile I walked represented over 1,000 young people who would love to have had a place to call home surrounded by loved ones this Christmas. <br></p><p>Every £1 you donate and every step I took, brings us closer to ending homelessness for good. Please, please donate and help get these youngsters off the streets.</p><p>Thank you so much for your kindness. <br></p><p>WE DID IT!!!<br></p>",514,514,"2020-12-21 25/2019-07-18 360/2019-01-28

Within a short period of time, the organisation managed to recruit a team of volunteers who began to distribute a selection of food, essential toiletries and warm clothes. <br><br>Since then, they have enlisted the support from major companies such as Aldi, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons and Marks &amp; Spencer, who kindly donate supplies of food which are collected during the day and then distribute to homeless shelters throughout Glasgow, Edinburgh and Lanarkshire in the evenings.<br></p><p>Anyone who saw the above picture of the huge line of homeless people waiting to be fed one night under the Hielanman's Umbrella recently couldn’t fail to have been shocked. I know I was. It’s been an issue in Glasgow for a long time, but things have clearly got much, much worse<br><br>That soup kitchen is being ran by Homeless Project Scotland, an organisation completely made up of volunteers. Not one person is taking a wager despite the tireless work they do in and around the city with every penny donated going directly to people who are in the most desperate of need.<br><br>Things are rough all round at the moment, but I can’t stand back and do nothing knowing this is going on right on our doorsteps. So a group of us have got together, with more joining every day, to walk the West Highland Way and raise as much as possible for this amazing charity, who need support now more than ever, due to the impact of COVID-restrictions.<br><br>We are planning on doing the walk over several days in April, lockdown willing. It will be socially distanced, compliant with all regulations and hopefully by the end of it we will have hit our group target of £50,000. <br><br>We know things are tight, but if you can spare anything at all, be assured it will be making a huge difference to someone’s life.<br><br>Even if you can’t donate, a share will do.

Paul instigated this, after an evening of drinks at the Alex just under a year ago. We are all linked by having children who have been at Bishop Gilpin Primary School. None of us, apart from Paul have done a Triathlon before; we are all over fifty and in various states of decay

Set in the grounds of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Blenheim Palace is full of history and surrounded by beautiful British gardens and nature. It is described, by those that know, as the most stunning triathlon in the UK.

The course starts with a beginner friendly, fresh lake open water swim for 750m, followed by a gently undulating bike course along completely closed roads for 19.8 km. And to finish off, we enjoy beautiful scenery as we run around the Queen’s pool for 5.4km!

We have decided to raise funds for Faith in Action Merton Homelessness Project (FiA) something we have all volunteered or supported in the past

As an example of where your donation goes

•	£5 per month pays for two Square Meals for a service user

•	£10 pays for razors for two weeks to enable service users to shower and shave

•	£17 pays the cost of one average service user’s day at the Drop-In

Locally, efforts to keep everyone in have just ended and more people will need a safe place to stay this winter.

The huge challenge they face is keeping everyone who doesnt have a home off the street, in suitable accommodation, with everything they need to stay healthy and well, while helping them find a more suitable, more permanent home. All this while there continues to be a severe shortage of suitable and affordable homes meaning moving on from emergency accommodation can be incredibly difficult.

Recently, I have had the pleasure of meeting a number of lovely people,&nbsp; who have unfortunately&nbsp; found themselves in difficult times, consequently making them homeless. Talking to these people, has highlighted the hardship they endure on a daily basis to simply survive. One person I met told me of how he became homeless (through no fault of his own)&nbsp; and how he feels embarrassed asking strangers for spare change...and even more embarrassed when they ignore him. I have to admit this broke my heart.

I relied on food banks and kind donations from the general public at times. I can remember the Christmas of 2012, I woke up on Christmas day in a place called Yeovil Foyer, it was a youth hostel place for 16-25 year olds to go when they had nowhere left to turn, it was great because it kept me off the streets but I struggled to get on with other people that lived there and the staff, I felt isolated and I didn't see a future for myself at all. Since then I have had many more times of being on the streets on cold, wet, horrible dark nights and I understand what it's like to feel like you have nothing and nobody left but there is hope and we can make sure others do not have to go through this alone.</p><p>As I type this it is almost Christmas day of 2017 and I live with my mother and brother in a warm home so now I would like to try and raise as much money as possible for the homeless and help them gain the hope I now have.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

,,,SC050207,"Homeless Project Scotland",False,2021-02-13,"<p>Anyone who saw the image of the huge line of homeless people waiting to be fed one night under the Hielanman's Umbrella recently couldn’t fail to have been shocked. We know we were. It’s been an issue in Glasgow for a long time, but things have clearly gotten much, much worse.

That soup kitchen is being ran by Homeless Project Scotland, an organisation completely made up of volunteers. Not one person is taking a wage despite the tireless work they do in and around the city, with every penny donated going directly to people who are in the most desperate of need.

Things are rough all round at the moment, but we can’t stand back and do nothing, knowing that this is going on right on our doorstep. As a result, a group of us have gotten together, with more joining every day, to walk the West Highland Way and raise as much as possible for this amazing charity who need support now more than ever due to the impact of COVID-restrictions.

Lockdown willing, we are planning on doing the walk over several days in April. It will be socially distanced, compliant with all regulations and hopefully by the end of it we will have hit our group target of £50,000. 

The money raised will go towards equipping Homeless Project Scotland with a custom-fitted outreach vehicle. This will vastly improve their capability to supply food, essentials and support to those most in need both in Glasgow and across the country.

We know things are tight, but if you can spare anything at all, please be assured it will be making a huge difference to someone’s life.

Even if you can’t donate, a share will do. It all counts and if you want to join in the walk itself, we’d love to have you along. You can do one day, the whole thing or anything in between. It’s up to you. Get it touch with us through this page and we can talk you through it. 

In the meantime, let’s do what we can to help the people who help everyone else.</p>",23,23,"2021-05-16 20/2021-05-07 20/2021-05-05 50/2021-05-03 10/2021-05-01 50/2021-04-30 300/2021-04-26 50/2021-04-22 50/2021-02-19 10/2021-02-19 10/2021-02-15 50/2021-02-14 20/2021-02-14 50/2021-02-14 80/2021-02-14 50/2021-02-14 20/2021-02-14 30/2021-02-14 20/2021-02-13 30/2021-02-13 20/2021-02-13 20/2021-02-13 100",https://www.justgiving.com/Andyc1888,2021-05-16,1110,2000,"Andys page"

This is a pioneering project which has created a meaningful and sustainable model of collaboration between developers, contractors, supply chain organisations, the city Council and local charities. As far as we are aware, this is the largest single commitment from these industries towards the reduction of homelessness in the UK and we hope that it will be replicated. 

We are working with the Manchester Homelessness Partnership and Big Change MCR to ensure that our efforts and your donations are channelled to where they are most needed. This fund will support potentially hundreds of people who are homeless in Manchester and will prevent more people from becoming homeless.

This is just a small part of my project and I'm partially hoping that it will work as a form of non-traditional&nbsp;public art. Whilst brainstorming ideas for this project, I focused on Peterborough because I have lived here most of my life meaning I have a personal attachment to this specific Urban Environment. A big issue in most urban environments is homelessness because of the overpopulation of the area, meaning it is difficult to earn money and afford a roof over your head, let alone food to eat. This is a huge problem in Peterborough so I'm using this project to start a campaign and raise awareness. </p><p>I have started this fundraising page mainly to raise awareness about Peterborough Soup Kitchen. Upon researching them recently, I have found out that they provide food and drinks for 35 - 76 people A DAY. The charity deserves the donations and if you live in or have visited Peterborough, you will know just how many unfortunate, homeless people there are on the streets.

I say my hand pledged because I don't think my brain even processed anything before I said I'd do it 😂 I guess my encounters with the homeless in Bham city centre made me not think twice. I'll mention a couple of people I always think about if you wanted to have a read: (or if not, maybe donate through the link 😉😉)</p><p><br></p><p dir=""ltr"">1. Once, I saw this guy the same age as me who was selling the big issue. He didn't mind me asking him how he got homeless. He said that his mum was an alcohol/drug addict (I can't remember which one it was about 4 years ago) and he refused to pay towards her addiction as he saw it was harming her and so he got kicked out the house for this. He said he didn't want to end up begging on the streets but rather earn some money by doing something. I told him I'd give him some money but I didn't want the big issue but he felt like this was begging as I wouldn't be getting anything in return. He did accept this eventually though. I think his story affected me more because he was my age and I couldn't imagine my life being like that. </p><p><br></p><p dir=""ltr"">2. Another time, a man asked me for some change as he wanted a baguette but was just a few pennies short. He literally just wanted those few pennies and nothing more. I however didn't have much loose change on me so I gave him £1 but kept trying to refuse this as he said this was more than he needed for his baguette. Eventually he kept it but realised that because he stopped me, I had missed my bus. He repeatedly apologised and kept saying thank you and 'God bless you.' His genuiness and gratefulness was something else and has stuck with me til today. </p><p><br></p><p dir=""ltr"">I know that there are negative perceptions of homeless people. At the end of the day, it could happen to anyone and it's not necessarily anyone's fault. Sometimes we just need a little support in life which is what As-Suffa aims to do. I'd appreciate any amount of donations and if you can't donate right now, then maybe share this link so someone else can donate 😊</p><p><br></p><p dir=""ltr"">Thank youuuu ❤</p><p><br></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

,,,1151645,"Caring in Bristol",False,2019-09-11,"<p>Growing up in the Bristol area, I remember homelessness being prevalent in the 90s. I used to find it very upsetting and so, every Christmas time, with my friends, we would go carol singing in order to raise money for Bristol's homeless. For a while, homelessness appeared to lessen, but in recent years it is definitely on the up again. I now have children of my own and now, when we see a homeless person, they find it extremely upsetting and worrying. They are little young for carol singing.. So I wracked my brains.. What could we do instead, something all of us could be involved in, something that, on top of maybe raising a little money, would also help the local area. Then it dawned on me. Litter picking. We happen to litter pick a lot anyway, but to do it for a cause gives us an extra motivation! So. This is the plan. We will litter pick AT LEAST once a week between now (10th September) until Christmas.&nbsp;</p><p>We really hope you might consider sponsoring us.

I went back to the gym about 4 years ago and through uphill max treadmill walking and spinning on the gym bike I lost 3 stone. I started running with Griffithstown Harriers after my neighbour said I ought to join a club. I stumbled across The Barkley Marathons Netflix documentary and got hooked on what we’re capable of achieving in endurance running. I ran 1688 miles last year and climbed up over 150k feet, that’s 5 Everests. I did 3 32 mile Ultra marathons around the Brecon Beacons, the Black Mountains and Snowdon ( I didn’t complete that one, did 30 miles of it but will post about that later), and a mountain marathon around the Beacons last year. I haven’t even done a road marathon yet, apart from a training one for the Ultras.&nbsp;</p><p>I was a student in Cardiff between 1982-85. Back then there may have been perhaps 3 or 4 people on the streets asking for money. I’ve recently been back and cannot believe the scale of homelessness now starkly evident. Every closed shopfront has a tent in it on St Mary’s Street and Queen Street and many other places too. That is why I want to raise money for The Huggard.</p><p>I did the Virtual London Marathon today &nbsp;3rd October 2021 doing theAbergavenny 3Peaks plus about 4 extra miles and 5000ft of elevation.Please chuck a few quid in the pot if you can thank you!!!</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Last week, in light of the Coronavirus, we made the difficult decision to offer a takeaway-only food service to guests rather than their usual sit-down meal. As most of you know, we take a huge amount of pride in the fact that we offer not just a warm meal to our guests, but also a safe and warm space off the streets for them for the hours they're with us. As we considered the health risks we decided that it would be prudent to only offer a takeaway food service for the foreseeable future.Absolutely any donation will have a huge impact on our services.

The huge challenge they face is keeping everyone who doesnt have a home off the street, in suitable accommodation, with everything they need to stay healthy and well, while helping them find a more suitable, more permanent home. All this while there continues to be a severe shortage of suitable and affordable homes meaning moving on from emergency accommodation can be incredibly difficult.

""If you're here, it's not that you're making bad decisions, it's that you don't know how to make consecutive good decisions."" 

Dorian's life was troubled from an early age. Finding himself homeless after a domestic row, he was at rock bottom and was referred to Depaul UK. Depaul does more than provide accommodation. They work with young people like Dorian to fulfill his potential and move towards an independent, positive future. 

In his own words: ""With Depaul, they've helped me with budgeting. They've shown me what matters. Being here at Depaul, now, I'm more or less ready to move into my own place.""

This is a pioneering project which has created a meaningful and sustainable model of collaboration between developers, contractors, supply chain organisations, the city Council and local charities. As far as we are aware, this is the largest single commitment from these industries towards the reduction of homelessness in the UK and we hope that it will be replicated. We are working with the Manchester Homelessness Partnership and Big Change MCR to ensure that our efforts and your donations are channelled to where they are most needed.

Covid-19 has presented us with challenges and we had to carefully rethink our approach to Harvest. Transporting multiple items from homes, to schools and churches and then on to our projects inevitably increases the risk of infection.

The huge challenge they face is keeping everyone who doesnt have a home off the street, in suitable accommodation, with everything they need to stay healthy and well, while helping them find a more suitable, more permanent home. All this while there continues to be a severe shortage of suitable and affordable homes meaning moving on from emergency accommodation can be incredibly difficult.

They include Shelter, The Salvation Army and Supporting Lives. Originally Alex was going to charge people to come and watch and raise money that way, but as it turned out, everyone got so excited he ended up waiving the ticket price.</p><p>Now, that's an absolutely amazing thing to do, but also means that we're going to have to work harder to try and help raise some pounds for some people who are in a really vulnerable position at the moment.</p><p>Homelessness is something extremely close to my heart, I've worked around them, spoken to them, helped them, given to them...you name it, I've done it. Most of the time, I think the important thing was is that someone noticed them...it often amazes me how they seem to be forgotten about, or looked down on. Everyone is always so keen to raise money for other charities, yet at times I think we forget there's so many people on our streets desperate for help. They're not desperate for handouts, just a roof once or twice a week, a warm shower, maybe a plate of food.&nbsp;</p><p>So whilst Homeless Worldwide raises money for various charities and splits it, I've decided to focus our efforts on raising money for Shelter.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not expecting us to raise a load of money, heck, we've all got to look after ourselves too at the moment, our families, our friends, but even if we raised £25 and got one person a bed for the night, then I can't think of anything better, making a difference to just one person's life, even for a short space of time...what could be more important than that.&nbsp;</p><p>We're living in a time where we've all got to pull together, we've got to look out for one another and be there as much as we can.

WE HAD AN INITIAL TARGET OF PRODUCING 3000 FOOD PACKS PER DAY BUT THIS QUICKLY RAMPED UP. WE ARE ALSO DISTRIBUTING NON-PERISHABLE FOOD NATIONWIDE. WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT TO HELP US&nbsp; KEEP THIS VITAL SERVICE GOING FOR AS LONG AS IT IS NEEDED, AS WELL AS SUPPORTING SOCIAL BITE'S WORK IN THE LONG TERM.&nbsp;</span></p><p>We want to tell you about how we have been affected by&nbsp;<span>the COVID-19 outbreak and how we&nbsp;</span>plan to respond &nbsp;- hopefully with your support.&nbsp;</p><p>Like with every hospitality business all over the world the Coronavirus outbreak has put Social Bite's future into great uncertainty. We currently operate 5 social enterprise cafes where we offer free food to those in need and 1 in 3 of our workforce have struggled with homelessness. All of these cafes, as well as our corporate catering business, have been forced to close during the outbreak.</p><p>Furthermore, the homeless and vulnerable people we support on a daily basis will be the worst affected by this crisis. Imagine being homeless, having no option to self isolate or stock up on supplies, with many support services you were relying on closing down. Alongside homeless people there will be thousands more people who end up in food poverty, families who were relying on free school meals and those who have just been made redundant due to the crisis.</p><p>We thought long and hard about how to respond to this to best help these people in desperate need, whilst trying to minimise staff redundancies and protect the future of Social Bite. The below is our solution and we are asking for your support to deliver it:</p><p>Since Friday 20th March we have re-purposed our entire organisation to create a nationwide food delivery service. Our kitchens, cafes and teams have been entirely re-deployed to produce and deliver food and supplies to those who need them most for the duration of this outbreak.&nbsp;<span>We are working with partners to ensure that food and essential supplies can reach the following people</span></p><p>- Homeless People</p><p>- Families that were relying on free school meals and now have no access</p><p>-Those who have been made redundant due to the crisis and are in food poverty</p><p><br></p><p>Your support will help us to:</p><p><span>- produce and distribute thousands of food and essentials packs every single day for as long as is needed.</span></p><p><span>- Distribute non-perishable food and make donations to food-banks throughout the UK during Covid-19</span></p><p><span>- Support Social Bite to help homeless people with long term projects after the Covid-19 crisis ends</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p>Thank you in advance for your compassion and support in this incredibly difficult and uncertain time.</p>",5691,5691,"2021-09-17 15/2021-08-24 10/2021-08-19 100/2021-08-09 10/2021-08-04 50/2021-07-06 40/2021-05-09 30/2021-05-06 10/2021-05-03 20/2021-05-01

Rough sleeping is primarily concentrated in Scottish cities.<br><br>Steps to Hope SCIO regularly do coffee runs in the city centre of Edinburgh bringing hot drinks to those sleeping on our streets. A lot of the people we see suffer from addiction but have no resources or support to get the help they require. So as well as delivering hot drinks we also give them our information which could lead them to a clean and sober life as well as getting housed.<br><br>Steps to Hope is making an appeal to help raise funds so we can have a catering van on the streets of Edinburgh. This van will do routine stops offering hot food and drinks to those sleeping rough, as well as giving out vital support which could save lives.<br><br>We are a non-profit organisation who are not funded, so we rely solely on our fundraising events and donations from the public. Because of the generous support we have been shown from the public and fundraising, we have managed to launch two soup kitchens and rent a 4-bed room in a hostel. The 4-bed room is for our service users who we have been referred on to rehab. There is a waiting list of around three months for referrals into rehab, so we offer a safe place for our service users to stay whilst they await their placement. <br><br>By having this mobile catering van this will enable us to reach out to even more vulnerable and homeless people that have found themselves on the streets of Edinburgh.  We want to help those who wish to help themselves get off the streets but most importantly give those who want to deal with the cause of why they have become  homeless through addiction, abuse, and or mental health a chance. We will deliver hope and build a bridge into a new way of life.

We are lucky enough to have working ovens and we are going to use them to raise these much needed funds at a time of crisis. Each sponsor will receive gift of love heart cookies as a thank you as will the amazing volunteers and the Streetlytes guests.
You can’t feed people without an oven! Any money left over once the oven is up and running will go towards giving them a boost in 2021 when their needs are bigger than ever. This is small fundraiser which will make a huge impact.
