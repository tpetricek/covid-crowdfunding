Last November as Manchester entered lockdown restrictions local foodbanks came under increasing pressure and seen a huge increase in the need of food support. At the time I decided to embark on a wee running challenge to help raise some much needed funds for the Manchester South Central Foodbank.   One year on and food banks are again gearing up for another surge in demand as the most vulnerable people are plunged into further poverty due to the end of the furlough scheme  steep rises in energy bills and the recent cuts to Universal Credit.  Last year we raised over ¬£7000 running 10km a day for 30 days straight..  This year I‚Äôm gonna up the ante and ‚Äòattempt‚Äô to run 15km everyday in November.  Thats 105km a week..   450km over the month..   That‚Äôs an extra 35km a week and 150km across the month compared to last year!   If we can raise even a fraction of the money we did last year it will be more than worth it!! Any funds raised will help massively towards the pressures over the Christmas period and will help those most in need.  All donations no matter how small will be deeply appreciated and will go a long way.  Also  any runners out there hit me up! I‚Äôll need some support & encouragement to stay on track!  And we‚Äôre off.. ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",False

Last year as a group we raised a whopping ¬£3 000 !! Which was a massive increase on 2019. This year we are looking to smash that record again - with your help!!  Mine (and your) contribution last year was ¬£275 which I am so grateful for - but it would be amazing to beat that this year!!

Now more than ever  your donations and support will mean so much more.  COVID has caused complications and tough situations for everybody  some more than others. Food banks were crying out for food to support local communities last year and this year is no different!!

Even though this year has been mad for everyone there is still a lot of people who do not have the support & luxuries that most of us probably take for granted.  Sadly we are still live in a world where people and their families need your support. So again for this Christmas I will be doing a collection for Waterlooville food bank. I will be raising money which will go towards requested gifts for the families or can collect donations of presents/gifts - anything is acceptable!!     If you are in a position to donate anything at all I urge you to do so! It doesn‚Äôt have to be much & doesn‚Äôt have to be through me  even if over the next couple of weeks you can add a few extra bits to your shopping for your local food bank at a supermarket  anything helps!     So if you have a little extra money to donate this Christmas  I can guarantee there will be someone out there who will really appreciate it!     Please message me if you would like to donate gifts towards this and I‚Äôm more than happy to collect any local donations if required!!I will be looking to have donations by the 15th December 2021.",False

I have put our costs below  all money is spent on keeping our services running.     Unit & storage rent: ¬£500 this is where our bus is parked and also our storage container.   Telephone & internet system: ¬£20 per month. This is for our landline number for people to get in touch with us.  Petrol: ¬£100 a month to help with volunteers cars.   Waste collection: ¬£20 a month   Portaloo: ¬£25 a week plus vat - we need to get one down yard so we have two toilets on site.   Insurance: ¬£110 a month.   Other costs: around ¬£300 monthly this could be things like topping up first aid box  topping up equipment on the bus or carrying out dbs checks.   These are our main costs we need to cover every month just to run if you could please make a donation and share.   You can see what we do on our Facebook page Norwich Homeless Support.       ",False

I am trying to raise funds  just a small amount  to help 2 friends who are expecting a baby to get by until their benefits are sorted out!   The young couple in question would help anyone in the best way they could  but they now need just a little bit of help themselves! I am going to keep their names to myself so as to not cause them any embarrassment  not that they should feel any  a lot of us have been in similar situations. I will refer to them as R (female) & A (Male). Due to severe illness  and being 31 weeks pregnant  R is unable to work at present  and A is her carer.   Unfortunately they have hit hard times  getting a little behind with things  and have recently been going without food and heating due to lack of accessible funds. At present they are awaiting benefits decisions which as a lot of people know can sometimes take weeks  even months. They have tried everything to speed things along  have been refused help from the council where they live  citizens advice bureau told them there was nothing they can do but wait  and the food bank only allows a household to visit for supplies 1 a month! They have electricity  but no gas for heating  they have no food in and have been surviving on little bits they have managed to acquire here and there. They have no immediate family that can help either! Needless to say all of the stress is affecting R's health even further  physically and mentally  and is also putting the baby at risk!!   I have loaned them a little personally  until they can afford to repay it  but it wasn't much  they are worrying about that too even though I have told them not to and I'm in no rush  but their situation is worsening day by day!   Please could you find it in your hearts to help them get past this rough patch and back on their feet by donating just a small amount towards helping a wonderful young couple pull through their tough time! I would sincerely appreciate any donation  however small! All moneys will be transferred straight to their account to help them purchase food  gas & other essential items! Thanks",False

Last 2 years was really difficult for me i been thru so much problems and struggling and because of that I get in really big debs with bills and people. My wifi been cut and my phone either I had days when I couldn't afford a food and was getting help from food banks but the food was already expired so I wasn't able give it for kids. I'm using one app when people give free food sometimes but I couldn't always get it as I'm not driving and the food need to be pick up by myself. Boys dad is not really much in our life he don't even have time to come and see his son and they miss him so much and keep asking when he will finally come and girls dad want to prison and he left me with everything on my own. My life is a hell at the moment as I can't afford even to get a food for kids and that's making me feel like the worse mum ever. Aalia my little princess have health problems. She start everything late like rolling from belly to back  sitting  crawling and now she's 18 months and still doesn't walk as her muscles are too weak and she will need physiotherapy and appointments with different doctors and this will cost me a lot. Ian have ADHD what make his life more difficult as not many people understand him and saying that he's very naughty child what makes him often upset but really he's the sweetest child I ever met he have so much love inside his little heart he will give me hugs and kisses like no other child will do. Always when I'm sad or he see me crying he always gonna come to me hug me wipe my tears and said ""don't cry mummy i love you"" and this words makes me keep going and fighting everyday because I know I have my children to live for. Without them I would be probably dead right now. I was going thru deep depression and sometimes I feel like I don't deserve to be a mum as my children deserve everything what's the best for them and atm I can't give them much because I'm a bit financially struggling Im not able to afford anything and this kill me everyday special when they asking me if I can buy them something they really want. If I could back to work I would do it but atm that's not possible as my little one is just 3 months old and I don't have any family or much friends here. I wish I could back to Poland to my parents but I can't even afford to do my girls passports as everyday I'm trying to manage to get some food or stuff for kids . I love my kids so much from bottom of my heart and I could die for them if I will have to and I feel very bad and shy to ask for help but atm that's the only option I have so if you can help me even little bit I would really much appreciate it at this will let me finally live without stressing everyday that someone will knock to my door or i that my kids will have no food in the fridge.

I have previously worked for Foodbank as a volunteer during the pandemic helping homeless people  migrants  and other vulnerable people.    Situation?    I have always worked and paid my living expenses when I had a student visa. However  because of the hostile environment policy and UK‚Äôs draconian immigration system  I do not have permission to work  and I have no recourse to public funds (NRPF)  meaning that I have no access to housing support and benefits. As a result  I have been couch surfing and relying on the kindness of friends to stop me from being street homeless. I am also struggling with prediabetes and need proper nutrition and diet to avoid my situation getting worse.    What‚Äôs the plan?
