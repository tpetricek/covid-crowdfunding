The rate of people seeking help from homelessness charities is increasing year on year.     People become homeless for lots of different reasons  including a lack of affordable housing  poverty and unemployment. People can be forced into homelessness when they leave prison  or when they escape a violent or abusive relationship. On average  people in the UK are only three paydays away from becoming homeless. Nearly all cases of homelessness are preventable  and every case can be ended  with the right funding and support.     in 2021 over 227 000 families were experiencing homelessness  including 126 000 children. It is estimated that 1 in 96 people are homeless in the West Midlands. We (Courtney Baddeley and Callum Fox) are organising a sleep out to help out in order to raise money for homelessness in the local area of Newcastle under lyme. We will be spending the whole night on the 14th may on the streets of the town centre to see first hand the struggles that a lot of people face everyday.    100% of funds raised are going to the Macari Foundation.",False
