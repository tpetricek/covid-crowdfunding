So I want to help raise funds for several good banks in the Wolverhampton area. Not only will they need help paying for everything  but the amount of people that may be forced to use food banks is only set to rise  so to help them be able to provide food for those that need it most  I’m looking to raise as much as I can  even to help in the short term and provide them with a much needed boost. We never know if we might need a food bank at some point in the future and I hope to help so they can continue doing the fantastic work they currently do. ",False

This May I am running my very first half marathon  in support of the Hackney Foodbank and I am asking for your help to raise as much as we can to help those in need.   I've seen first hand the great work the charity does to support Hackney residents with the most basic of necessities but also provide information and support to those in need. I've also seen how quickly demand has grown  and we are all aware of how that growth is sadly likely to continue. In January and February  we gave out 51 919.89 kg of emergency food parcels alongside information about how to access wider support from local organisations. So please  give as generously as you can  but know that every donation counts.   Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause which means so much to me. ",False

Our father worked long hours travelling from Yorkshire to London and back every day delivering. But no matter how hard he worked it just wasn't enough to feed his family. Back in the early 90s there wasn't much help as in food banks and charities that help communities. So a few years ago I made it my aim and ambition to raise money for worthwhile charities that help the community. Where the money raised goes directly to the people that need it. This is my third skydive for charity and I've never come across such a fantastic guy such as James Anderson is and his amazing team at Depher. So please donate as much as you can to help me raise funds for such a worthy cause. The skydive will take place at black knights Parachute centre on 30th July",False

In 2020 during the peak of covid “P” was living with her son and partner  away from family  friends and any normality. Her relationship soon became a very dangerous environment in which she had to escape to save herself and her son from an alcoholic abuser. This resulted in them both living in a homeless shelter with no money  belongings and miles away from family members. Since then thankfully “p” and her son now have a roof over their head however during the time at the shelter with income affected due to lack of childcare and work she accumulated around £3000 worth of debt which to this day she is still struggling to pay off. She has contacted multiple charities  uc  food banks to receive as much help as she can to make ends meet from month to month however she has exhausted all of her avenues and is very much struggling. She’s just informed me on how she has £27 in the bank until the 9th of may and bills to pay and a hungry toddler to feed.

According to Statista ""In 2020/21  over 421 000 people used the help of a foodbank in London  an increase of nearly 200 000 when compared to the previous year. The use of Foodbanks in London has steadily climbed in recent years  with just 118 000 users recorded in 2011/12.""    This Ramadan  there is problem in the Muslim demographic too. Charity Islamic relief has estimated that 50% of Muslims in the UK will struggle to have enough food to break their fast. One of the foodbanks that we have connected with  SUFRA NW London has said that the recent pandemic led to a 400% increase in bills… Tufail Hussain  director of Islamic relief UK has said ‘Many will be fasting from sunrise to sunset and there is a real risk that families will not have enough food or will go without to feed their children.’     We have pledged to raise £500 by Thursday 21 April 2022. The funds raised will be used to buy essential food items to supply to three foodbanks/kitchens around London. The more we raise  the more we can donate. We want you to be part of this experience so all will be captured to share.    Although  charitable causes need no incentive. We will be randomly picking two sponsors to giveaway a whole tray of our signature (and ever popular) bestselling brownies.    Finally  Feeding Hungry is Serving Allah. Abu Hurayrah (ra) said that Holy Prophet Muhammad (saw) said  “Allah (swt) will say on the day of resurrection  “…O son of Adam  I asked you for food and you fed Me not. He will say: O Lord  and how should I feed You when You are the Lord of the worlds? He will say: Did you not know that My servant So-and-so asked you for food and you fed him not? Did you not know that had you fed him you would surely have found that (the reward for doing so) with Me?” [Muslim]    May Allah reward you all for your intention and reward you for your generosity.

GFTH was set up just over 5 years ago to provide hot meals  free haircuts  clothing and toiletries to the homeless and vulnerable in our community.    Since then GFTH have set up a full time foodbank and in the past two years have served over 15 000 meals and over 3000 free food parcels to the homeless  vulnerable and those needing a helping hand. Pretty impressive right?!    GFTH have recently started a daily hot food programme with approximately 3500 meals served in the past two months alone.    All this is done with founder Hash Norat holding down a full time job (as well as many of the volunteers too).     We now need your help to raise £10 000 collectively  for us to purchase a food trailer. This will allow us to support more of our homeless and vulnerable in our city but more importantly  all of Gloucestershire.    I am taking part in a fundraising cycle from Gloucester Cathedral to Land's End  to be completed over two days.     Please help us to make our vision a reality  by sponsoring anything you can. Every penny helps!     Your every penny will be supporting our most vulnerable for years to come.     Again  please check us out on Facebook and see all of the great work that we do.

","Norton Canes, West Midlands, United Kingdom",https://www.gofundme.com/f/7cvdta-change-the-world,0,10000,,2022-03-23,,,0,,"EDIT: Since writing this i have come to believe that i am probably slightly autistic  which explains why i probably sound a bit cracked.   I have 2 projects  the main one is a revolutionary low overhead charitable project that i intend to pilot in the UK then go global. It's an internet based scheme that involves Apple  Utube and Google the second is a government run project that i devised over 4 years ago that could generate huge sums for the treasury as well as many other benefits. I have literally been trying to talk to my government (conservative) for over 4 years and can back this up. When i thought of my government run project i rather naively thought i would have no problem pitching it to the government (at the time i thought they were wrong  but they were the party in power and had the ability to bring it about and all i wanted out of it was a decent job. To me it's a no brainer and all I needed was the support of a high level official with the vision and authority to get this through  it would be a perfect fit for the EU but trying to contact anyone is a total nightmare. I got a condescending letter off my MP (amanda milling) turning me down so i asked her for a lump sum provided the government used it with a guarantee of confidentiality so i could try other governments if they didn't use it. Again with the patronising rejection  i sent hundreds of emails and letters to everyone i could think of that could help  no response. Because i relied on financial security from selling my idea i spent 2 years without an income  i reached the point where i thought that i should get a job and was actively looking when covid hit  i immediately realised it was going to be serious and as I'm staying with my 82 year old mother who has COPD and is highly vulnerable i went on voluntary lockdown. My needs were simple  i wasn't spending much but i was using my overdraft to pay my credit card bill every month but eventually (despite always paying the minimum payment) my credit card was suspended a few weeks ago and my overdraft has now exceeded it's limit and my bank wanted immediate payment as of last monday. This is why i need £10 000 pretty much immediately. I can pay off my overdraft and credit card and buy a secure laptop and printer as well as sort transport out to carry out my second project.   I thought my first idea was good  the second is genius. I started from how can i get £10 000 and kept on saying to myself ""how can i improve on that?"". I came up with a low overhead (1% overhead) charity project run on the basis that i take 1% of any money pledged (i had socially concious millionaires in mind) to pay for my living expenses and operating costs. What i envisaged was aforementioned socially concious millionaire could continue with their own lives while i get the best bang for their buck by contacting various registered low overhead charities finding out what they needed and sending the donor an email with the details. They can either check it out and send a cheque. Considering the average charity's costs are around 33% this makes me incredibly efficient.   Then i had a eureka moment and thought about how i could improve on this and came up with an organisation that can help provide jobs  give the homeless somewhere decent to live  fund foodbanks and creates several spin off charities. I used my life experiences and sense of humour to turn the basic concept into a global organisation involving some of the biggest companies on the planet including Apple  Google  Tesla  Utube  Microsoft  Lego  Ikea  Bmw mottorad  paypal and ebay.I intend to set up and run a pilot project in the UK then let Apple and Google run it over the rest of the world.   I have 70+ pages of notes so far.  If you're thinking that this is a scam I'm prepared to backup everything i said  I'm not a businessman  i can't deal with red tape and bureaucracy  i just have ideas that need to happen and I've run out of time and the bulk of the funds will be under the direct control of the backer(s)  I live in the Midlands (uk).My ideas include merchandising  raising and dispersing funds  homing the homeless  providing funds to food banks  setting up factories in areas of high unemployment (all over the world) to manufacture a range of bears i created (with a USP) and assisting other charities and all businesses will be run on ethical  non discriminatory lines.  Because my overdraft has been exceeded i am no longer be able to pay my phone bill so am only contactable by email. (I live in a bad signal area anyway).   Please note that i need £10 000 pounds  not dollars as shown but i can't seem to change it.  My bank account is in the UK. The current British government and sweatshop owners need not apply.Change the World.     ",True

This half term  however  and over this coming Christmas  we truly need your help to feed the new wave of people and pets from across London who are in crisis and will be coming through our doors this winter at Kath's Place  50 Friendly Street  Deptford SE8 4DR.    But this October millions will lose £1040 through the cut to #UniversalCredit people many in low paid work & most already on the breadline not helped by the increasing high cost of rent & rising energy -transport costs .Can you imagine losing up to 20%plus of your monthly income? That is the reality for so many people in the present crisis. Rents are so high in our area that people in work do not have enough cash to pay the rent and  probably for the first time in their lives  are having to trade a visit to their local coffee shop for a visit to the We Care Food Bank and Food Pantry for help  advice  support and solidarity. Embarrased and even ashamed  but even more desperate and distraught that their kids are going hungry  mums tell us that they can go days without food  and  on average  it takes people at least a week of going hungry before they finally come through our doors and ask for help. We really do need your donation this Christmas GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw . Becasue we help everyone and anyone and do not focus on one particular group (such as refugees or the homeless) we get absolutely NO national or local government funding or any other type of funding.

Due to the pandemic  countless numbers of small and local businesses have been forced to close - with barbershops/hair salons being examples of the businesses that are suffering the most. Now  the normal response for the owner of a business like this would be to take advantage of rate relief  seek bridge funding for the business and also look for financial support being offered to people that are self-employed.    But not Ziggy...        Ziggy has converted the Barbershop into a Food Bank that is specifically focused on helping the elderly and other vulnerable members of the local community to have access to the food and sustenance they need in a time when it may be challenging to make trips to supermarkets or go shopping themselves.    We all know that local businesses like barbershops are massive pillars within communities as they are connected to so many people and aware of a range of local issues. So  who better and where better for a Food Bank to support vulnerable people to come from?        As it stands  Ziggy is not only travelling (on his own dime) to his shop  to the homes of people who cannot make it to his Food Bank and even spending his own money to buy food if he is short on donations from local people that are aware his Food Bank Exists.

We never imagined that six months on we would still be working on the foodbank  the need has not gone away - if anything it’s needed now more than ever. ⠀ The food bank team are now launching a new charity to carry on this important work  as well as aiming to deliver some other exciting new projects. The new group is called ‘Broxtowe Community Projects’ and we are currently fundraising to secure our own premises and continue funding the much needed food parcels. Today we had some really exciting news about a premises and now launching the charity has become a reality. ⠀ We are asking people to contribute to the running costs of this charity in order to keep our shelves stocked and to help us invest in important community projects which will improve the lives and opportunities for the people of Broxtowe. We are fortunate to have secured a premises rent free  but the need for food is increasing so funds are needed now more than ever. The £10000 we are hoping to raise will keep our shelves well stocked for the next six months and allow us to invest in a range of training for our volunteers  introduce more grants and support schemes for our service users and maybe even secure a van to enable our service to travel. We are fairly unique amongst food banks in that we do not limit the number of food parcels someone can access in a year  we accept self referrals and also offer fresh food that includes fruit and vegetables  cheese  milk and a range of frozen foods in addition to the usual ambient packets. We also try and offer our service users a degree of choice to ensure a sense of dignity and we provide advice  guidance and onward referrals where needed. Please if you can  give generously so we can continue to do this important work. Thank you  Broxtowe Community Projects Team. ",False

Many individuals and families have suffered additional hardship during this period and demand for foodbank services has increased significantly over this time and continues to rise. The ending of the furlough scheme at the end of October is likely to result in this demand increasing further as more people are unfortunately likely to be made redundant.    The foodbank at Danebury Drive has been run since the start of lockdown by one individual from her own front garden. Initially this was on a small scale helping a number of local families  but has grown significantly to the point where currently 50 food parcels are produced weekly with an addition 75 individuals access the food on offer for collection for themselves and families.    As a result  the foodbank has become a valuable resource for families on the North and East sides of Acomb. This is one of a network of community foodbanks set up across the city who are all working together to share resources best they can.    The onset of winter means that to continue premises need to found as running this outside with no cover will no longer be viable. Premises have been found at a local church with the offer of a peppercorn rent. In addition to rent funding will be required to cover rent and fuel costs    The foodbank currently receives a significant amount of food donations from Co-op  Fareshare and Morrisons amongst others which is mainly of items such as bread and non-perishable items. Whilst the support has been amazing  this rarely provides sufficient fresh items to support the need  hence the additional purchase of such items mentioned above. Clearly such nutritional items are required for an individual to have a balanced diet  made more important by the fact that many children are supported by the bank.    Up to date the £250pw for fresh items has been covered by a weekly £200pw purchase of produce by a local charity (Kitchen for Everyone York) with the additional made up by the small amount of monetary donations received at the foodbank. However  the current level of support from Kitchen for Everyone cannot be maintained and their support has dropped to £100pw due to a shortage of funding. This level of funding will be continued until the end of 2020.    The costs of powering the fridge freezers and fuel for collection has been borne by the individual running the bank  but this cannot be maintained.    Your help is requested to help continue the service that has been so invaluable for the local community  especially as there are concerns that demand is more likely to increase in the short term rather than decline.",False

This support started when there was no halal food support in the local area of Sharrow and Netheredge and people were struggling to buy basic food for themselves. Due to a gap in the area and a desperate need TSY collaborated with few others to collectively reach out to the most vulnerable including single parents  elderly  self isolating and hardship such as loss of income. All our work is voluntary and since March kind donations from local community has assisted us in making sure no one struggled alone. We are running low on cash donations to purchase food to continue this vital support and are reaching out to anyone who can support us by using this link and donating whatever little they can towards the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank project. Due to the level of need and referrals coming in since the start of this halal foodbank  we have called it Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank to avoid any barriers to any non-muslim vulnerable that maybe in need of this support.

Our family were in awe by his altruistic desire to give  feed and aid ALL  despite race/ethnicity/religion among him even whilst suffering himself.     Since opening  our family alone have vetted 25 families with monthly food rations from December 2019- present. Unfortunately  25 families do not cover the innumerable amount of people starving  for whom we want to share some light  hope and nurture to amidst dark times  that is their indefinite reality.    Our foodbank prioritises poor families with children  single mothers/widowers and those who themselves or their children suffer with debilitating mental/physical health issues trying to make ends meet to provide for their children- this is done with rigorous checks by our team to ensure nobody exploits such a service. The families are issued with a monthly ration card valid for 12 months which provides them with stock for each month as per the individual needs of the family. These include: 10kg chapati flour (atta)  5kg sugar  5kg various lentils/daal  5kg rice  5L cooking oil  tea leaves  salt  spices and other necessary food items. £25 will feed a family of 5 for the month however any donation  no matter how big or small will impact them greatly.     100% of the donationsgo to those in need  with our incredible staff being voluntary workers (so no wages or salaries are deducted from donations) and our facilities funded with the finances that the late Safdar Hussain Shah left behind for us to carry this out in his legacy- we are relying on your kind donations which will solely provide stock for the families.     During the current COVID-19 crisis  we are aiming to try and provide emergency food supplies to all those suffering in the locale  with the most vulnerable holding priority  we are giving out thousands of food rations but are broken to see that we are unable to extend our help to everyone that needs it- as a small start-up charity  we are grateful for all the support and donations we receive in order to help us reach as many individuals suffering from the crisis as possible.     Unfortunately  we can't do this alone  with the power of unity together we can help fill the stomachs of the poor  not only with food but also the fulfilment of life and hope they may gradually receive from your donations. Our brothers and sisters around the globe need us  we are united by our efforts.   Any donation  no matter how big or small will be greatly appreciated especially in the blessed month of Ramadan  whereby charity is considered its greatest.     We are not the givers  we are just Allah SWT  the Almighty's  servants and can only give what he allows and wishes to be given. The families we aim to feed is by the grace of Allah SWT and it is he who provides to all.     May Allah SWT accept this from you and me  may we fulfil our duty by helping those in need  for which it is their right upon you and I.    “A man’s true wealth is the good he does in this world.” Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W)    Instagram: sadaqajariya.foodbank for further updates",False

We use the van each week to collect and deliver donated essential furniture such as beds and cookers to people in need. Without a working van  our ability to help people most in need across Wells and the surrounding villages will be more limited. Demand for help from Wells Vineyard Foodbank & Furniture Storehouse has risen 6-fold during the pandemic. In 2021  over 80 000 meals have been distributed in our area. People are referred by support agencies  GPs and schools and will receive a food box with approximately 4 days worth of food with 3 meals a day plus toiletries.     The Furniture Storehouse recycles donated furniture  stores it and distributes it free upon referral. In 2021  266 items of essential furniture such as beds and white goods were delivered to people in desperate need. Without a working van  we can no longer offer this service. We already have a third of the money we need to buy a van  but need your help to make this happen! You can make a difference by donating today to WELLS VINEYARD CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP.

Day  2021. The player in question will be the one who scores the first goal for Town after the target has been reached.     --    The Welcome Centre is a Huddersfield-based foodbank that provides basic essentials to people in need. Unfortunately  the COVID-19 crisis has seen demand for their services rise and donations fall. To help  and in the absence of matchday donations  the Huddersfield Town Supporters’ Association (HTSA) and other Fans For Foodbanks partners are asking people to donate what they can.     All donations  no matter how big or small  or greatly appreciated. Stay safe and keep the faith. ",False

The Project /Building Purley Masjid​    Purley Masjid is a modern Islamic community centre in a suburb of South London  Purley. It was established in 2015 after fund raising to accommodate the needs of the local Muslim community.    Ma Sha’ Allah  the Masjid is now trying to cope with the demand and has to overcome many challenges to support the Muslim and also non-Muslim community. Here are just a few of examples of the issues:     We have one main hall which accommodates only 200 people for an average Jumu’ah congregation of over 400.      People often have to wait outside in the forecourt for the second Jamaat     Current facilities for ladies accommodates around 30  whereas the demand is known to be in excess of 150. This is severely restricting our ability to meet current demand for women     Our lectures  Fitness Classes  Mother and Toddlers group  daily iftaris in Ramadhan and seniors meet up sessions all take place on the same carpeted area on which we pray. This is not ideal and as we are effectively operating out of one hall  it means that we can only have one activity happening at any given time     The Food Bank only has enough space for a shelf rack to store food. It caters for anyone in need in the Purley community  Muslim and non-Muslim alike        By the Grace of Allah swt we have embarked on the Building Purley Masjid project that will cater for the needs of the community. The project will result in a new Masjid on the current Purley Masjid site and will be a modern  purpose built building for the community spanning 6 floors that will include:     Two male prayer halls with a combined capacity of 500     A ladies prayer hall with capacity of over 200 and crèche facilities      A multi purpose hall     A dedicated lecture/events hall (we held over 100 last year)  which can accommodate 100 people     Improved facilities for our already existing Youth Activities  Mother and Toddlers Group and Seniors Group     Separate classrooms for our Madrasah classes      More space for our weekly Food Bank  ​​    We already have all these activities running at Purley Masjid but are struggling to meet demands and keep up the excellent level of service we provide.",False

Every week we take the money you have kindly donated to a cash and carry and buy  in bulk  what the four food banks we are working with have told us they desperately need. (See pics below). This is complemented by a weekly visit to the Felix Project where we load up with fresh fruit  veg  meat  eggs and cheese. All of this is delivered to community kitchens who cook up meals for those most in need in W10.    We are currently working with The Dalgarno Trust   Bay 20   The Space and The Tabernacle . All four of these charities provide meals  bags of shopping and many other support services to those experiencing food poverty in W10. Kensington and Chelsea boasts some of the highest net worth inhabitants but also has many pockets of severe deprivation – North Kensington is one of the deepest. A sobering fact to note is that 31.6% of children in this borough live in poverty.    Food banks we are working alongside unanimously concur that the demand for aid has tripled this year since the pandemic began. Help is needed more than ever. Every time we make a drop  the relief and joy the charities express is palpable and sums up how desperate the situation is.    All the money donated will be used to supply fruit  veg and essentials to those in need in North Kensington. Your financial donations will go entirely towards funding this food relief project. All staff  including Rima  Amanda  Maryam and the admin  safeguarding and marketing support team are volunteers.     Please share this page with anyone who might be interested in helping and please donate if you would like to help. A regular donation would make a huge difference  as food poverty is not going to go away.    Thank you for your invaluable support.    Rima  Maryam  Amanda and team.

Over the course of 11 weeks  they raised £16 000. With the help of a team of local volunteers producing over 6000 meals  all of which were delivered to those most in need in the North Ken community.     The last campaign attracted a lot of attention with publicity in newspapers both local and national  RBK&C Mayor Gerard Hargreaves came to visit and recently in October this year Rima was on Radio 5 Live discussing food poverty and school meals.

We are continuing to support these families in term time and the holidays.     £50 raised will be able to feed 25 young people    £100 raised will be able to feed 50 young people    £1000 raised will be able to feed 500 young people     There is power in our community. Join us.        Food provision through schools and youth clubs play an essential role in providing food for children and families who are in need of it - this is especially true during the holidays  when Free School Meals (FSM) are not usually available. Recently  the government (after several U-turns) decided to extend funding for FSM over the school holidays  but several families received substandard food packages that still forced them to rely on extra aid from food banks and mutual aid community groups.    Many young people are also not entitled to free school meals during term time because their parents earn above the amount allowed for eligibility for free school meals. In England  earnings from employment must be less than £16 190 for families in receipt of Child Tax or Working Tax Credits  and only £7 400 per year for families in receipt of Universal Credit.     This is staggeringly low and  when combined with measures such as the two child limit on Universal Credit payments  means that many families struggling to put food on the table are nevertheless deemed ineligible for free school meals. Other families are unable to claim FSM for their children because they have no recourse to public funds (NPRF) which is a condition the government imposes on some families due to their immigration status.      What does this mean?    Those recently impacted by the financial costs of COVID-19 (which are only increasing)  are more likely to go hungry. This will have bothphysiological and psychological impacts on young people and their families.     Why?    The data collected by CPAG on child poverty in the UK are enraging: 4.2 million children were living in poverty in the UK in 2018-19  out of which 700 000 were in London. This has been worsened by the fact that parents and carers are twice as likely to lose their jobs due to the pandemic.     In Lewisham  according to Trust for London   37% of children are in a situation of food insecurity  and 14% of the population needs social benefits to survive. It's deeply distressing that this level of inequality exists in the UK  particularly given that we are one of the richest countries in the world.     Don’t know what living with food insecurity feels like? See here .    The figures above reflect the shocking inequality in Britain  which was already severely impacting children and young people before the worst financial effects caused by the pandemic began to be felt. Due to the government’s lackluster response to the pandemic  it is projected that the number of children in poverty will increase to 5.2 million by 2022.     We also cannot ignore that this impact has not been distributed equally: people coming from Communities of Colour and immigrant background are over twice as likely to live in hardship than their white British counterparts and  due to the wider structural racial injustices  these communities are also disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. We are certainly not 'all in this together'.      What are we doing about it?     Legendary Community Club  which was named by Chevrington Odoh from the Pro Plus FC   is a grassroots project set up by some members of Lewisham Mutual Aid in partnership with local organisations. Our aim is to deliver emergency food provision to ensure that young people do not go without out  for as long as there is a need.       We will make this happen in three ways:    1. Temporary food provisions have been set-up for families who require this support  in partnership with local schools and community groups.    2. A kitchen has been set up to prepare nutritionally balanced meals for young people through their youth clubs which run after school and in the school holidays.    We know that food charity is not a long term solution. This is not the world we want to live in and we refuse to normalise food banks as a solution to food poverty. This is NOT an inevitable situation.    3. With this in mind  we will continue to work alongside The Children's Society  who have been calling on the government to ensure that every local council adequately funds emergency support for families   so that nobody is left behind in a time of crisis. For more information about their campaign 'Strengthening the Safety Net' see here   and sign the petition here.    We will also continue to support the calls from Save the Children and Child Poverty Action Group who have been lobbying for reforms to the benefits system  as well as an increase in the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit by £20  and an end to the two child limit and the £20 000 a year benefit cap which hits families in high-rent areas such as Lewisham particularly hard. Lastly  we will continue to support IFAN with the #CashFirst campaign  which has already inspired us to start our very own community-led participatory research project (stay tuned for more on this!).     The way our tax and welfare system is designed is a political choice. There are solutions . We will call on the government and its representatives to be bold  brave and radical in how they approach this problem.       What will we use the funds for?      We will use the money raised from the community to buy food and equipment for the project.    We have a host of volunteers  and multiple clubs and schools signed up and ready to go. The project began on July 21st 2020.       £50 raised will be able to feed 45 children     £100 raised will be able to feed 90 children     £1000 raised will be able to feed 909 children       There is power in our community.

Can you believe it?    In that time  we have fed more than 2500 families across Reading and the surrounding areas.    It started as a small venture but as the word got out  it became more and more apparent that there was a huge grey area in the community regarding the support of families who have their lives turned on it’s head over night.    Free Meals  Full Hearts is NOT designed to help the same families on a week in  week out basis. I created the group to support those who maybe too proud or embarrassed to reach out for help or go to a food bank. It was created for families who may have faced redundancy or who are struggling on furlough… it’s for those without a support network around them who needs a little short term support.    I have been overwhelmed with the support in the last 12 months. The newspaper articles and TV appearances has helped raise a huge amount of awareness. And I’m overwhelmingly flattered to have received my Pride of Britain AND Pride of Reading nominations- thank you to everyone who has voted!    The success of this group purely comes down to both the physical donation of food but also the financial support provided by this Go Fund Me page. I would not be able to do what I do without this so thank you in anticipation for your support    All the money raised is used within this group and is withdrawn for food  personal hygiene products and pet products.

Many families have been left to fend for themselves during this time with little support from schools and other social services. “Bridge the gap have a passion to support families  parents  children and those with additional needs as this is something dear to our hearts. At Bridge the Gap  we believe in social inclusion and want to combat the digital divide that has left so many people with no access to information  resources and learning.” - Melissa Francis had started to provide support to local families in the beginning by: Signposting them to services for further support for Befriending also offering 6 months virtual tutoring for children. Enabling access to food banks  food hubs and hot meals  Providing information on available support schemes and youth services for children’s basic educational needs (such as http://www.hackneyquest.org.uk/ and http://www.shortbreakshackney.com/short-breaks-offer-update-covid-19)  Supporting SEN families with information through https://www.hiphackney.org.uk/home.html Sourcing laptops and other devices for families that are not eligible for other kinds of funding  Sharing of information to families regarding benefit claims so that people are not pushed into homelessness. At the beginning of the pandemic  we worked with T’s tasty cuisine to provide 1 hot meal  food parcels and essential items every Wednesday for a short period. We continue to work alongside Hackney quest  the wickers charity  Caribeats  The Hackney community closet  HIP  young Hackney  volunteering centre Hackney  our place and Connecting all communities organisation to provide other services such as food  clothing  and information and signposting information. Our main focus at BTG is to provide laptops and other devices to families and vulnerable people who otherwise would not be able to access them. These months of enforced Homeschooling and unpredicted lockdown periods and rise in variants have revealed the many barriers facing low-income families (incl. job losses  food insecurity  housing issues homelessness  domestic abuse  family bereavements and many more…). Many families are still struggling to rely on food banks as cuts to income still is evident . Families and those with no recourse to public funds have been left with no access to a laptop or Internet provision where they continue to struggle to access online resources. since schools began to reopen after the first lockdown  and second lockdown we had still seen numerous amount of families still struggling for devices for their children till current.   We have continued to support families with a donation received as all donations goes back into overhead costs to maintain the service providing to those in our community. At present through this uncertain new variant  the list of referrals are rising as families and individuals including asylum seekers and those fleeing domestic violence continue to desperately require a device for their children  or accessing services and further education to improve their lives. our determination to continue with this project to help families is very much needed.     Over 2200 people had benefitted from our services over the past 19 months this included food  essential items  devices  signposting and referrals  6 month digital tutoring programme ran by our volunteer tutors  and a listening ears as this was evident people needed someone to talk to.   We continue to support families and individuals to help make a difference to their lives .     Your generous donation can help make a difference.      We receive donations of devices and refurbish them to go out back into the community with a donation received as all devices incurs a cost to be fixed.     The break down per refurbished device purchased from computer aid is £85 per unit £15 for windows 10 to be installed per device equal to £100 per device and software.    For 10 families this will be £1000 required to raise to offer support.         1 X Amazon Tablet for a family in need (£50.00) Fuel costs to cover the expenses of our generous Community volunteers so they are not out of pocket. Website costs  storage units  and overhead project costs. We think this is a really effective way to support families in Hackney and offering support to individuals and other organisations in other borough's that has reached out to our service  as we are offering a long-term solution to an urgent need. So far we have been able to provide over 500 plus people with a digital device   and have currently 2 families and 8 individuals including referrals from hestia  Shaw Trust and other services requiring a device on the waiting list with more requests coming in weekly.

We are so excited about the prospect of bringing this old Grade II listed building back to life! It was originally built in the early 1900’s as a Temperance Hall  since then it has had a plethora of uses  most recent of which left the building in a semi-derelict condition which included severe fire damage.    However  following its acquisition by The Tab Church  fresh ideas began to surface as to how it might be rescued  restored  and adapted to suit the needs for modern usage as Church  Community and Conferencing facility.    The ‘Tab1Milli’ is what will enable this most significant part of the Big Build project vision to become a reality  and the building actually able to be used.    But we can’t pull this off without your generous support because this is the largest financial project The Tab has ever undertaken.    We are therefore asking you to join with us through radical generosity  as together we step out in faith towards hitting the £1Million target by continually bringing our financial gifts together now and over the coming weeks and months.    Once the entire building is renovated  it will enable The Tab to continue and expand its traditional church functions and community initiatives  which are not limited to but currently include:  · Sunday services  · Kids church for children  · Crèche during the Sunday services  · Weekly prayer meetings  · Christian education and classes  · Administrative offices  · Bookshop/resources  · Food Bank – hosting Lewisham Central’s foodbank and distribution point. This is currently offered two-three times a week  staffed by 8-12 volunteers.  · Youth mentoring – support for vulnerable young people in the local community.  · Community action team (Restoration Empowerment and Community Help) – which focuses its support and resources on three vulnerable groups in Lewisham:  The elderly (offering days out and grocery food supplies);  The homeless (offering food clothing to those living on the streets)  and  Women and children escaping from domestic abuse (offering support).    *The Big Build Project includes the overall vision of Tabernacle Global Ministries and therefore maybe used for general purposes....",False

I cook the meals with love and care and it is a privilege to be able to do so.     I began by wanting to help NHS and Care Home staff during the first Covid 19 lockdown in March 2020. as of January 2022 I have cooked 7137 meals that I have made as delicious  pretty and nutritional as possible. I have also made sure they can be safely frozen  defrosted and can be re-heated in a microwave.     After 2 periods of self-isolation I started cooking from home on the 24th of April 2020 for the staff at my local care home  an NHS critical care nurse and a weeks worth of meals for a now 90 year old I've been cooking for since he lost his wife years ago.     I have moved from 25 meals per session to a my maximum of 214 on January 3 2022. I keep some meals in my freezer so that if anyone has a tough shift  they can contact me and I can give them a home-cooked meal to go home with. I spend 16 hours or each time I cook for carers and will continue to do so for as long as I can; hopefully the rest of my life. The NHS has looked after me and my kids brilliantly and I want to give back.     I am utterly inspired by the NHS  Community Centre and Care Home Staff I meet. They make me want to be kinder  work harder and just be better.     My ultimate goal is to do this by teaching kids how to do the cooking with so that there is a double and ever growing benefit. But for now  I want to feed people and make their lives a little bit easier.     Giving one person a wonderful meal means something. Donating is the same. I can make a little go a long way because I am brilliantly supported by Leathams for many ingredients  Nodene from Shands Cakes for Cakes  Ken Watts for eggs that go to Nodene to make the cakes  Val  Ian and Sue for the containers  Seasoned Pioneers for spices and 4000 portions so far of Swiss Chard from my Garden. 100% of the donations I receive will go towards buying ingredients  occasional boxes of protective gloves / masks and a £50 freezer to be able to store more ingredients and meals.

As a result of the partnerships which have been made we have been able to supply food parcels for up to 100 families a week at times  this does not account for the number of people who come to collect food items at the church and these are separate to the Foodbank referrals. The contacts for the food parcels have come through various schools  individuals and other groups. We have also arranged the purchase and packing of around 50 fresh fruit and vegetable parcels for the local food bank each week. Since the start of Covid we have produced over 1250 food parcels between the Wokingham Community Hub  the Foodbank and direct contacts.    The majority of the items we have are donated however with the financial donations we receive we are able to put this back into the project and purchase items that we require. Share- Wokingham has been open daily to anyone who can come along to Norreys Church  offering bakery items and any other surplus food stock we have – there is no charge for this but if people are able to make a donation  however small  it is always appreciated. This means it does not carry the stigma attached to going to the Foodbank as people are not just being able to feed themselves for little to no money but they are also having an environmental impact in tackling the waste issue.    As the pandemic has continued the needs of those that we support have changed  initially it was people who were shielding and unable to get out and now we are really seeing the economic impact  job losses and financial woes have meant that people are struggling - that is where we can support.",False
