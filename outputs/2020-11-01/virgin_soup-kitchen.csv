We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year.

This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK.

However we understand that providing accomodation isn't the only way to end homelessness and provide a range of holistic opportunities for our clients. With the help of their support worker, they can learn the skills needed to live independently, address their past and build a positive future.    We offer homeless prevention and wellbeing education sessions, mediation, counselling, a foodbank and have 4 furniture shops selling quality donated items and new low cost white goods.  We operate an outreach programme to engage with and support rough sleepers plus offer daily support from our main homeless site, Reconnect.     We are affiliated to YMCA England, but are responsible for raising our own funds so every penny you raise is spent locally.
