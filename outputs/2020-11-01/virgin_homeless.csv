CHESS currently operates a direct access 9 bedroom night shelter in Chelmsford, providing a safe enviroment and services, including a bedroom, hygiene/laundry facilities, home cooked meals and drinks.  CHESS also provides 5 other properties including an annex to the night shelter and 4 move on shared accommodation sites, which serve as a further step towards indpendent living. This in turn means we can house 32 individuals in total at any given time. Not having access to everyday essentials and services makes it difficult for those experiencing homelessness to sustain relationships, employment and contribute to society. They often come from chaotic backgrounds with complex needs. Many CHESS Service Users have had the additional trauma of rough sleeping and health related issues. Not having any structure to their day makes it extremely hard for them to gain control of their lives, which can have a detrimental effect on their health, leading to addiction, depression and poorer physical well-being. Once enrolled into the CHESS Change Programme, residents are assigned to a Support Worker who works with the individual to indentify causes of homelessness and address issues they may be facing.  They will assist them with registerig woth local services, and ultimately securnig more permanent accommodation. We offer a professional counselling service, and refer to other providers to help them with any problems they have that empowers them to move on in their lives. We offer certificated training courses providing qualifications that could lead to employment. We also run a Winter Project between November and March, offering 10 emergency beds and breakfast to rough sleepers. Alongside this our Outreach Team will support any rough sleepers referred via Streetlink, covering Chelmsford, Maldon, Braintree and Epping. We provide sleeping bags, warm clothes and snacks, with the possibility of temporary accommodation at our Night Shelter for emergency cases.","2020-08-17 10/2020-08-17 20/2020-08-17 10/2020-08-16 20/2020-08-16 30/2020-08-16 15/2020-08-15 10/2020-08-14 15/2020-08-14 30/2020-08-13 30/2020-08-12 20/2020-08-12 30/2020-08-12 5/2020-08-12 10/2020-08-12 5/2020-08-12 10",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=CHESS&pageUrl=2,2020-08-17,,,270

We want to make sure they have a firm base for a brighter future – and your fundraising activities are an essential part of this. Where will the money go?  All the funds you raise will contribute towards helping vulnerable young people who are either homeless or faced with homelessness find a safe place to live, receive support when they need it and have someone to turn to when they feel they have nowhere else to go. Most of all, you’ll be giving them hope and a real opportunity for a positive future.       ","2020-10-21 10/2020-10-14 10/2020-10-13 20/2020-10-04 20/2020-10-04 20/2020-10-04 10/2020-10-04 30/2020-10-04 15/2020-10-04 30/2020-10-03 15/2020-10-03 10/2020-10-03 30/2020-10-03 15/2020-10-03 30/2020-10-03 20/2020-09-30 15/2020-09-28 20/2020-09-28 30/2020-09-27 20/2020-09-27 20/2020-09-27 25/2020-09-27 20/2020-09-27 15/2020-09-27 30/2020-09-21 10/2020-09-10 15/2020-09-09 50/2020-09-09 20/2020-04-28 20/2020-04-26 15/2020-02-28 20/2020-02-28 26/2020-02-28 10/2020-02-24 20/2020-02-23 10/2020-02-23 20/2020-02-23 10/2020-02-23 20/2020-02-18 20/2020-02-17 30/2020-02-16 50/2020-02-16 26/2020-02-16 10/2020-02-16 20/2020-02-15 20/2020-02-15 20/2020-02-15 50",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=KateForman1&pageUrl=1,2020-10-21,"Throughout London",,1062

If you do not let us know, money raised may go towards the RSPCA in England and Wales.  Money is not redistributed to branches; if you wish to fundraise for a branch, please select the branch name from the charity listing, as they are separately registered charities. How your gifts save their lives  If it wasn’t for the generosity of our supporters, we wouldn’t exist.   For more than 195 years the RSPCA has been working to relieve the suffering of animals. The RSPCA only exists because of public donations. Thanks to you, we can keep on fighting cruelty - in all its forms. So how does your donation help?  Your donations help us investigate complaints of cruelty, rescue animals from suffering and neglect, care for them and find them loving new homes. For example:  £10 could help to provide a day’s board for a horse who has suffered cruel treatment.  £25 could help kit out an inspector with hard hat, boots and life jacket.  £50 could help equip an inspector’s van with an animal first aid kit, pet carrier and animal-catching set.","2020-10-31 10/2020-10-31 10/2020-10-31 20/2020-10-30 30/2020-10-23 5/2020-10-17 15/2020-10-16 30/2020-10-13 5/2020-10-11 10/2020-10-10 15/2020-10-09 15/2020-10-09 10/2020-10-09 15/2020-10-08 10/2020-10-07 20/2020-10-05 10/2020-10-05 20/2020-10-04 4/2020-10-04 30/2020-10-03 30/2020-10-03 15/2020-10-03 15/2020-10-03 10/2020-10-02 10/2020-10-02 50/2020-10-02 10/2020-10-02 20/2020-10-01 10/2020-09-30 30/2020-09-30 30/2020-09-30 10",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=Asenifoundation&pageUrl=1,2020-10-31,,,539

Together with others who share our resolve, we bring our knowledge, experience and determination to campaign for the changes that will solve the homelessness crisis once and for all. We bring together a unique volunteer effort each Christmas, to bring warmth, companionship and vital services to people at one of the hardest times of the year, and offer a starting point out of homelessness.  We know that homelessness is not inevitable. We know that together we can end it.

In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year. That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK.

Families  We deliver a range of services to support children, young people and families facing challenges. By helping at an early stage, our work aims to prevent more serious problems arising in the future. Children We provide education to pre-school children in a safe, supportive environment which gives their parents peace-of-mind. We also provide positive activities for young people who have limited opportunities in life - parhaps they're caring for a parent or come from a socially-deprived area.
