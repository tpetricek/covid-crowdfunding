It’s Michael McIntyre in lockdown!    I’m trapped in my home and you’re trapped in yours so I've thought of an idea to raise spirits and raise money for a much needed cause.

All you have to do is make a donation on this GoFundMe page to the amazing charity  The Trussell Trust. Please give as much as you can  but know that I will be trying to video call as many people as I can regardless of how much you donate. When you donate just click the ‘contact’ button at the bottom of this page (under where it says Michael McIntyre  organizer) and give your phone number along with a reason I should video call you and someone will be in touch to arrange a time for me to call. The Trussell Trust supports a network of food banks across the UK to provide emergency food to people in crisis  while working to ensure everyone has enough money to buy their own food. With the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic  food banks need our help to get food to the people who need it most  more than ever.

"Send A Luxury Hamper To Every Tory MP This Xmas","Southend-on-Sea, East of England, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/hampersfortories,1780,20000,,2020-09-17,,,0,,"The vote to refuse 'free school meals' to British children over the upcoming school holidays showed us that on the whole  MPs from the Conservative Party are not afraid to make major decisions that although unpopular  are also for the greater good of the United Kingdom. We cannot have our hard-earned money being used to 'nationalise children' when the harsh reality is that we have other priorities to fund  such as 'Test and Trace' and renewing Trident.    Therefore  it's time for the British people to shown their gratitude for this valuable reminder that parents have to start taking responsibility for their own children and putting a little aside for emergencies.    I am raising £20 000 to send a luxury Christmas gift hamper to every single Conservative MP this festive season. I want every single one of them to know just how much their efforts have been appreciated in these incredibly worrying times.    Please help me spread some cheer this December to those who must be feeling unloved.    IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTE: I will be handling all of the donated funds personally  and my Santander Mobile Banking app has been playing up a lot since I dropped my iPhone down the toilet last week. The touch screen has well and truly had it  and for some reason every time I try to move money into the dedicated account I have set up for this hamper appeal  the money actually ends up going to the Essex Coronavirus Action Urgent Food Bank Appeal - a fundraiser that provides micro grants to food banks all over the county of Essex to stock up on essential products or meet unavoidable running costs.    Naturally I will be able to fix this when I get a new iPhone  but I am having a bugger of a time deciding between the Rose Gold iPhone 12 Pro Max and the Space Grey iPhone 12 Pro Max and no matter what I do  I simply can't make my mind up. Massive decisions like this cannot be rushed however ...    ADDITIONAL NOTE: With the news today that Essex County Council will also be boosting funding for local food banks (this is a fantastic development)  I will also be reaching out to organisations in this area to see if they have any urgent funding needs.

It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has launched to support our community and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.    The Lambeth Food Bank Fund     Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.    In Lambeth we have a history of looking after one another - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.     So we are creating something called the Lambeth Food Bank Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.     Our borough has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has been set up for us to help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.     Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Lambeth. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.      * * *    FAQs    What can I do?    Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the most vulnerable.     Where will the funds go?    The funds will go to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by Holy Trinity Clapham and delivered to food banks across the borough - including Brixton & Norwood  Clapham Park  Vauxhall  and Waterloo - that can help the most vulnerable.     If I do donate will it go to those who need it?     Yes  your donation will go to those who need it. Unlike other platforms  GoFundMe do not charge a fundraising fee although they take a small transaction fee. See here for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to.     I want to help my local community  will this money be spent in Lambeth?     Yes.     Where can I find accurate information about covid-19?

During this Coronavirus crisis  Britain's most-loved newspaper is under threat. Declining sales and advertising revenue could consign this shining example of journalistic standards to a terrible fate  and it's time that we stood up and took a stand.    The Sun was already suffering a financial crisis before Covid-19 even took hold ...      However  things have now become desperate for this historically blemish-free institution of British publishing with their very own Dan Wootton encouraging everyone to buy a copy and keep them in business - it does cost less than a cup of coffee after all.      Instead of just merely buying a copy to keep them in business  I want to take things further.    I will take every penny that is donated to this fundraising campaign and every day I will use it to buy copies of The Sun from my local store  and then deliver them absolutely free of charge to homes in my local area in South Essex. If other people follow my lead and set up their own fundraising campaigns  we could send their circulation through the roof in a matter of days!    IMPORTANT NOTE: During the lockdown  it's taking ages to get my kids to bed every night  and usually by the time they have settled down my local Sainsbury's is closed. If this happens on any particular day  I will donate the money to local food banks instead.    ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: I don't like rain  so if it is raining on any particular day I will donate any money collected to local food banks instead.    YET ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: I don't like sun or wind either  so if it is sunny or windy on any particular day I will donate any money collected to local food banks instead. I'm not fond of clouds either.    ONE FURTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: We should all be staying at home as much as possible at the moment to protect the NHS and save lives  and so if I think that there may be any people out and about in the United Kingdom at the same time as me on any particular day I will remain at home and donate any money collected to local food banks instead.    ONE MORE VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: If you actually think that I am giving that sh*t rag a single penny of this instead of donating the money to local food banks  you're very much mistaken.    Any questions? I'm on Facebook at Man Behaving Dadly - https://facebook.com/manbehavingdadly    ONE ABSOLUTELY VITAL NOTE THAT HAS BEEN DRAFTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MY ADVISORS: After some discussions with all relevant parties  it has been decided that all monies raised will be donated to the Essex Coronavirus Action Urgent Food Bank Appeal. Essex Coronavirus Action is a joint project between local government and a group of prominent Facebook admins in the county  including myself - it has also been 'blue ticked' by Facebook. A bank account is currently being maintained 'in trust' by the local authority's partner EALC  and any food bank in the county is being invited to apply for micro-grants as and when they need them - I will be paying all donations into that account as and when they clear in my bank account.

We live in a nation where more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. The Trussell Trust has given out over 1.6 million packs of food supplies in the past year alone. Food Banks are not just a place to pick up essential sustenance  with cuts to community centres and frontline services they have also become mini-welfare and advice centres.    We're aiming to raise £5000 before Christmas 2019  which will go to the Trussell Trust. Your donation will directly help those most in need of support. It is vital that those working in publishing come together as a community and take action.    It is important to help those in greatest need but solutions must also be found to the reasons people find themselves in need of food banks.    The Trussell Trust’s CEO Emma Revie has indicated that the benefits system has been driving a rise in foodbank use– the charity released their State of Hunger 2019 report in November.    “This is the busiest six months we’ve ever seen – more people than ever before are being forced to foodbanks’ doors ” said Revie. “Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty  but currently thousands of women  men and children are not receiving sufficient protection from destitution. This is not right. But we know this situation can be fixed – our benefits system could be the key to unlocking people from poverty. We need to put money back into the pockets of people who most need our support. It’s in our power as a country to end the need for foodbanks. This can change.”        Thank you for your support.

I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting.

Whilst children in poverty should not have to rely on charity to be able to eat  until politicians can sort this mess out  an immediate solution is needed to support pandemic hit families currently faced with empty cupboards.     This is more than a political issue  this is a deeply human issue; as a Mum it is an utterly unbearable thought that right now parents are standing in front of an empty cupboard  knowing that they can't feed their kids.    Think about that for a moment. It's a truly terrible thought.    This is not something I can stand by and watch without doing something.    As the founder of a community of 100k Mums  it feels like we CAN do something together to make a difference in the short term at least.    We have a chance to give whatever we can to provide urgently needed help to our most needy families.     All money raised will go directly to FairShare  the UK’s longest running food redistribution charity. They have seen demand for food skyrocket  particularly among frontline organisations providing food to children and their families. With the coronavirus pandemic pushing thousands of people into financial hardship  and the government's recent decision  many more families will struggle to put food on the table.    They urgently need help to deliver more healthy  nutritious food to the food banks  community groups  activity schemes and schools supporting the UK’s most vulnerable children during this crisis.      Every £1 could provide four meals for children in need. Our goal is to raise £5000 which could provide 20 000 meals to children in need.    Many of you already support this  or other similar organisations - you are wonderful  thank you.    If you don't and like me you've watched the news this week wondering what you can do to help  supporting this campaign and donating here WILL make a difference.

The Robin Hood Fund has launched to support our city and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.    The Robin Hood Fund     Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.    In Nottingham we have a famous history of looking after one another. You could call it the spirit of Robin Hood - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.     So we are creating something called the Robin Hood Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.     Our city has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Robin Hood Fund has been set up for us to shine a light on these vital projects and help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.     Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that if possible you donate and contribute to the common good of Nottingham. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.

Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the vulnerable.     Where have funds been used?    Since the Robin Hood Fund started we have always had one goal  to raise as much money as possible to help those most in need.     To date; the following causes have been supported;     Since the Robin Hood Fund launched we have had one clear goal  to raise much needed funds to support the most vulnerable people in Nottingham during the Covid-19 crisis. Following an amazing response from the people and organisations of our city we have already exceeded all expectations in raising more than £75 000 which has been distributed - or is in the process of being distributed - to a number of charities and organisations undertaking such important work during these difficult times.      To date; the following causes have been supported:      Foodbanks (£20 000)    The Robin Hood Fund has distributed £20 000 in support of food banks across Nottingham. Working closely with Hope Nottingham and Nottingham Forest in the Community to deliver the wider support  food and supplies have been centrally purchased and then distributed to a number of different food banks  including: NG11 Clifton Foodbank  Meadows Foodbank  Grace Church  HOPE Nottingham  Bestwood & Bulwell Foodbank  Himmah / Muslim Hands  Arnold Foodbank and St. Ann’s Advice Centre.      Homeless Organisations (£10 000)    Emmanuel House was awarded £6 000 for additional specialist key worker support to boost its team at a time when Nottingham’s homeless community is at grave risk. This support is helping to ensure the homeless community are being placed into hotel accommodation as an emergency measure as hostels are very vulnerable to outbreaks.       There has also been £4 000 of support released to Framework to enable them to purchase essential items to the Homeless community in Nottingham. This included  but was not limited to  the provision of items such as mobile phones so that they can remain in contact with key workers and minimise the chance of these individuals being unable to stick to the government guidelines on social distancing.       Refugee Groups (£2 500)    Refugee Roots were provided with support to allow them to move from a model that required face to face contact  to being able to still provide support in a safe and socially distanced way.      In addition  Refugee Forum has been provided with funding for a destitution fund to ensure those with no access to support in other places can still get support.       Vulnerable Women (£4 500)    Nottingham Women's Centre have been awarded funding to help them to provide mental health support and online counselling  including training for counsellors to be able to provide online support.      In addition to this  further support was provided to POW Nottingham  an organisation supporting the rights of sex workers and those at risk of being exploited. This funding enabled them to purchase essential items including food and toiletries.      Disability Groups (£2 500)      With social distancing measures causing increased issues for the disability community in Nottingham  this support has enabled the Disability Support Nottingham organisation to increase its capability to provide phone support - in addition to welfare checks - to those in need.      Vulnerable Young People (£2 500)     Funding has also been provided to help support the amazing work of Nottingham YMCA  who are working with the most vulnerable young people in our city during this crisis. The support has helped to provide food and toiletries to those housed in supported YMCA and transitional accommodation.      Where will the funds go?    The most vulnerable people during this crisis and will be administered by the city council and delivered by people and organisations across the city that can help the most vulnerable.    Every Monday Nottingham City Council will administer the release of funds from GoFundMe to Nottingham City Council bank account. This means Nottingham City Council should  on average  have the money in the bank no later than Friday of every week.    Once in Nottingham City Council account the funds are ring fenced and held until the decision re: allocation has been made.    A working group  chaired by Lee Walker  will be set up to recommend how that branch of funds is released. This group is tasked with making the biggest impact possible whilst also being certain that the organisations in receipt a) need and b) promise to spend quickly ie. nobody saves the money. On Tuesday of each week the working group will have a paper approved by a member of ‘gold’ and paperwork will be sent to a small governance committee who are tasked with ethics and assuring the highest standards of governance and distribution.    Remotely the governance group will scrutinise and approve. Once approved Nottingham City Council agrees to distribute as agreed.

"Give Martha a Chance","Westbury, South West England, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/gary-the-garbage-cat,2432,-1,,2019-11-30,,,0,,"**NO LONGER ACCEPTING DONATIONS**    Thanks to our amazing donors  Martha the cat is on the road to recovery. She needed her broken leg amputated  and is currently resting up and recuperating. Thanks to our amazing donors  her vet fees were all paid for  and we have a little left over which we're going to reallocate to other needy cats via charities and our local food banks  as we always promised we would. Thank you  from the bottom of our hearts  to every single donor.     If you have a little extra to spare  please consider your local cat charity. <3     When I moved into my house I noticed a stray cat that lived in the bins. It was nervous  unfriendly and didn't belong to anyone. I called it Gary the Garbage cat.       I spoke to neighbours and put up Facebook posts trying to figure out whether Gary had an owner  with no luck. I'd put out wet food for Gary to eat  and over time Gary started following me home for dinner. Last month we hit a milestone: scritches  purrs and mutual miaowing. Gary still lived in the bins  or chimney flues of the shops by my house  but came to the yard for dinner.    A few weeks ago my boyfriend  Alex  saw some teenagers trying to kick Gary and chased them off  and his car has since been vandalised. We couldn't take Gary in and risk giving our own cats illnesses  so we bought Gary a little house for the garden and sought veterinary help. The charity Cats in Distress offered to pay for a visit to the vet.       The first visit never happened because Gary escaped while under the care of the rescue (wily minx) but we were reunited  and I set about giving Gary a bit of a clean up. At this point I was able to conclude...    Gary is a girl.        The newly-renamed Martha got a vet appointment rescheduled  and at the time we hoped it would just be a check up where we could assess her overall health  check her gungy eyes and look for a microchip.     However  last night  things took a turn.       Alex called me to say that Martha was walking with a limp  which hadn't happened before. I rushed home and picked her up to bring her in. The left paw was limp and she didn't want to put weight on it. I called the charity  who said to keep her safe and warm and wait for the appointment in the morning  but said that if Martha was injured they didn't have the funds to cover it. I was prepared  but hopeful that it was a sprain.    This morning we went to the vet  and the news was... well  it was bad.      Martha has broken teeth  a sore side and trauma to her face. She also has a suspected broken shoulder.    The vet said all of these injuries point to being kicked in the face.     The best case scenario for Martha is a mild fracture or dislocation. The worst case scenario is that we can't afford to treat the leg  and we all know what that means. She is about 4 or 5 and I am not ready to give up on her.    She is so affectionate and calm  even with this horrible injury. I need all the help I can get to literally get her back on her feet.    Any donations you can spare will go to Martha's vet fees and ongoing care. We don't know yet what she'll need  but the x-ray alone is going to cost £350  at best. That's assuming she will sit still under sedation and only needs two pictures taken.        In the unlikely  miraculous event that we raise more money than she needs for this injury we'll set up a fund for her ongoing care because she will now be completely uninsurable. Anything left over after that will be re-donated to other cats in need.     Please help us help Martha. She deserves better than the life she's had so far  and I can't afford to put it right on my own.     If you want to read more about Martha  you can catch up with the Twitter thread about her.",False

This is a 61% increase on last year.    Illness  disability  family breakdown  and job losses are just some of the reasons why staying above water is a struggle for millions of people. Coronavirus has exacerbated all of these issues  and the UK is now facing record high rates of unemployment and job losses. 32% of families have lost income as a result of Covid-19.      An additional 670 000 people will be destitute by the end of the year  meaning they cannot afford essentials like housing  energy  and food. Over 50% of people using food banks in the Food Banks network at the start of the pandemic had never needed one before. Families have been the hardest hit  accounting for nearly two in five households needing to use a food bank.

If you’re struggling with feeding your kids next week during half term and live in Weston  I’d like to help!

I’ll drop it off between 12pm and 2pm  please message me your address and how many are in your household.     When I was 17 I had a new baby and had just lost my mum. I was in and out of jobs because of my grief and mental health and I struggled to survive on the little help I got. I’ve not had enough money to pay my gas bill before and have had to cook pasta in the microwave to make sure my daughter got lunch  and I firmly believe that poverty isn’t a choice but an unfortunate circumstance  unlike our current government who think that hungry kids are a byproduct of parents simply ‘not being responsible’.     I manage these days and I’d like to pay it forward for all the times someone in the queue behind me paid for my shopping or a friend invited me round their house when I couldn’t afford my heating bill. Please get in touch if you need a helping hand.    Monday:    Pasta and meatballs in a secret five veg sauce     Tuesday:    Sausages  vegetable mash and gravy     Wednesday:    Five bean chilli-non-carne with garlic rice     Everything will be vegan  delicious  and packed with veg.

We are asking you to help us  by donating what you can to this crowdfund  and joining us on 22 August for an evening of pride  performance and love for Beirut  its people and its reconstruction. Rebuilding Beirut with Pride will be hosted at the Bell Pub in Whitechapel  and live-streamed all night for everyone to watch and take part in. From an art auction to a programme of performance  we want to celebrate Arab and queer art and talent and help rebuild our hometown in the process. Click here to buy your tickets for the event.    Where is the money going?    All proceeds will be equally split and donated to the Lebanese Red Cross  Beit El Baraka   Basmeh & Zeitooneh and Embrace Lebanon   as well as two grassroots LGBT+ crowdfunds  detailed below.     Beit El Baraka provide food banks for victims of the disaster  Basmeh & Zeitooneh are responding on the ground to those who have been made homeless  and Embrace Lebanon offers mental health support.     The NGOs were chosen after having direct discussions with several people within Lebanon itself who informed us of which organisations are trustworthy and are not affiliated with government authorities in any way  to ensure the money is directly going to support those in need first and foremost.    We have also identified two crowdfunds that have been strongly recommended to us by many members of Beirut's LGBTQ+ community  in that they are offering on-the-ground and direct support and are being led by trusted community members.     These crowdfunds are Disaster Relief for Lebanese Transgender Community   led by Lebanese trans pioneer Sasha Elijah  and Funds for LGBTQ Victims of Beirut Explosion   led by prominent community member Sandra Melhem.    The total sum raised will be split 6-way between these 6 beneficiaries  and receipts of these donations will be posted here for completely transparency.     Why are we fundraising?     Beirut is a disaster zone. On the 4th of August  the city was rocked by a colossal explosion involving 2 750 tons of ammonium nitrate. To put things in perspective  it is one of the worse urban explosions since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The blast killed at least 157 people and injured 5 000. Hundreds remain missing. With the force of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake  the explosion's shock wave enveloped Beirut  shattering windows and collapsing old buildings. Lebanon's hospitals - already overrun by coronavirus - are in dire need of support. Meanwhile  around 300 000 people have been displaced from their homes. Two of Beirut's LGBTQ+ hubs  Mar Mikhael and Gemmayze  were only 500m away from the point of detonation. These areas have been utterly devastated and  like many other parts of Beirut  are now uninhabitable.    The blast comes at the worse time for Lebanon  hitting a country already in disaster. Covid-19 exacerbated a pre-existing political and economic crisis  bringing the Lebanese to the brink of collapse. This year has seen thousands of Lebanese lose their lifetime savings and the country's hyper-inflated currency remains in free-fall. One in the three people are unemployed  while amongst Lebanon's poorest  famine is approaching. In short  your donations are needed. They will support those people immediately impacted by the explosion  but also Lebanese communities and families facing economic desolation. Please see below for which NGOs and groups we are donating to.    What's happening on the 22nd?     While we encourage you support us  share this page and ask all your friends to donate throughout the next two weeks  we have an exciting day planned to drum up even more donations! On 22 August there are two events you need to know about:    6:30PM: Art Auction (online)     We will be auctioning a collection of both Arab and Queer art  prints and designs  kindly donated by artists and designers from both the UK and Lebanon.

Let us know here!    8:00PM: Performances (In person & live streamed)    Rebuilding Beirut with Pride will be hosted at the Bell Pub in Whitechapel  and live-streamed all night for everyone to watch. We have a line up of performers showcasing Arab and Queer talent with opportunities and activities to donate to the fund throughout the night.

Diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer in the lungs and bones.        Thank you for choosing to read this page.  I don't quiet know where to start  however I know I need to start  for my lovely mum.    Those of you who know Andrea will know she is an extremely kind  caring  funny and positive person  who works as a self employed psychotherapist and counsellor. Those of you who know us  will know me and my mum have always been the best of friends and are extremely close  so this news saddens me deeply.     My beautiful mum was diagnosed with Cancer for the very first time in 2006 when I was just 7 years old. This was Skin Cancer  she had to battle it and work at the same time  such a hard thing for a single mum with two young kids  but after treatment and ops at Christie's Cancer Centre she bravely recovered.     Only to be diagnosed again in 2015 with Breast Cancer Stage 2 a very difficult time for us all  I remember the difficulty  going through my GCSE's whilst caring for my mum physically and emotionally. Financially this time was challenging for us as a family  as my mum has always worked so hard to provide for my brother and I  without any financial support from fathers. When she was diagnosed  the ops and treatment on top of the emotional pain made it so she really struggled to work  but had no other choice. The financial strain was one of the most stressful elements of her illness  and this really shouldn't be the case when you're facing a life threatening illness. We accessed food banks to eat and didn't get to enjoy pleasurable things that normal families do  instead I remember having to spend my wages from my part time job on food for our family. This was an embarrassing time for my mum as a mother works all her life to provide for her family but Cancer takes this right away  she tried so hard  never once giving up or asking anyone for anything.     My mum has always been a big believer in spiritual  holistic and alternative therapies  so she chose not to take the Chemotherapy which the doctors strongly advised claiming she wouldn't live more than a few years if it was not taken. She braved this and stayed true to her beliefs and used holistic  complementary therapies and PMA. Thankfully she was given the all clear from Breast Cancer and she started working as a therapist after completing her degree whilst fighting the cancer  and has never looked back since  she has been nothing less than completely dedicated to her job and gives her all to her clients  ensuring they feel fully supported and cared for.    Those of you who know Andrea for whatever reason she may have come in to your life  I'm sure everyone has the same view of her - a beautiful  selfless  generous and truly strong  inspiring woman. A woman who remains so positive and selfless regardless of what life throws at her.    Jubba  my mums younger sister passed away of Cancer in November  my mum received her unfortunate results on just 2 weeks after. Therefore it is even more of a difficult time for her  and all the family.    My mum first lost her voice last in November 2017. After undergoing investigations she discovered half her vocal cords have become paralysed. This means  if you haven't heard her  her voice is barely a whisper and has been like this for over a year. This has made her job as a counsellor very strenuous. Just before this Christmas  in November 2018 mums year long investigations (biopsy)showed cancerous cell changes in the lungs and that the canceous cells from the Breast Cancer had spread and there is now cancer in the sternum (breast bone) and lower spine  as well as other scattered locations around the body. My mum  my brother and I sat through the dreaded meeting with the cancer specialists on 4th Jan 2019 which we had been thinking of all Christmas  to be told that mums now has Secondary breast cancer which is metastatic and in the lungs and bones. We tried to remain calm however to be told that the cancer is Stage 4 and if treatment is taken then life expectancy is on average 2 years but 5 years at maximum. I struggled to hold it together and broke down in tears. The thought of loosing my only parent and absolute best friend  who has worked so hard all her life to be such a good mum to me  at this young age devastates me.     The doctors spent hours emphasising the severity of this Cancer  and how essential treatment is  and fast. My mum was advised to take a high dosage of IV chemotherapy 2 years intense at Christies Cancer Centre however  she has always been very resistant to such strong conventional medicine and made clear that if she was going to be given 2 years to live  she'd rather live these years to the fullest and not ill  bedbound from such harsh treatment. We have decided as a family and with the doctors for my mum to start treatment which consists of a little less intense Chemotherapy and a specialised medicine herceptin this Friday 11th Jan which she has to take every 2 weeks and go to the hospital every 3 weeks.     Being a single mum she has a lot on her plate  the side effects of this treatment will really rid my mum of her ability to function as normal  and will even make daily tasks a challenge nevermind her full time work as a therapist. Such as breathlessness  dizziness  bruising  stinging  arthalgia  myaliga  insomnia  jaw pain  increased risk of serious infection  lethargy  sore mouth  nausea and vomiting  heartburn and serious energy loss. As you can imagine  trying to hold a full time job down which is essential to live and pay bills would be incredibly hard and virtually impossible.    SO I've decided to set up this page  without my mums awareness to help alleviate some of the constant stress that shouldn't be her main worry when suffering a life threatening terminal cancer.     The generous donations will be spent on things like mums transport to and from hospital (as she doesn't drive). I am hoping that your kind donations will be able to enable my mum to not have to burn herself out and work  as much as she loves her job  it is detrimental to her health  it kills me seeing her so emotionally and physically exhausted  without any other option. **Since donations have been so generous I am really encouraging my Mum to see less clients and spend her energy on her own health  but this is fully dependent on your generous donations  so thank you so much.**    The money will enable my mum to explore alternative therapies and treatment such as holistic treatment which is never funded by the NHS (I know she has a list of many things she'd like to try but simply can't afford). Complementary therapies  counselling so that she can discuss the pain and fear this painful news brings. My mum also used to attend yoga classes but she recently had to finish as she told me she has to cut out luxuries due to money being limited and only based on how much she can work  so I would love her to be able to afford these classes again to help her health. And lastly  the money would go towards trying to find anything she can to help  I know she'd love to eat nutritious healthy foods that will help build her immune system and fight.     Andrea is and always has been the most generous and selfless person  you won't catch her being able to receive gifts or money very easily at all  however she'll easily give you her favourite ring or jumper if she thinks it suits you and you like it! She wont think twice about dropping everything to be there for you if you need someone. And she's never changed.     *Due to such devastating news I have chosen to leave my degree at the University of York and come home to care for my lovely Mum  so do message me if you have any ideas or ways you could help support.*    I will be looking to put on a fundraising event to raise money for my Mum so please do be in touch if you can help/have ideas.     I appreciate you taking time to read this and any donation no matter how small will honestly be so appreciated.    Love  Grace x      ",False

We provide after school food for young people attending Youth First Clubs in Lewisham as well as food parcels for young people and their families from specific schools in Lewisham and Tower Hamlets. We are continuing to support these families in term time and the holidays.     £50 raised will be able to feed 45 children     £100 raised will be able to feed 90 children     £1000 raised will be able to feed 909 children     There is power in our community. Join us.        Why are families experiencing hardship?    Despite the government's U-turn on extending the funding for free school meals over the summer holidays  hundreds of families who needed support were not entitled to the scheme. Young people who used to rely on school breakfast clubs and sports clubs for meals in term-time  and those recently impacted by the financial costs of COVID-19 (which are only increasing)  are more likely to go hungry and become malnourished as school and sports clubs are forced to close or reduce their services over the summer and beyond. This will have both physiological and psychological impacts on the children and their families.     Food Poverty    Child poverty rates in the UK are disgraceful: 700 000 children in London are living in poverty. In Lewisham  37% of children live in poverty and in one ward this is as high as 43.3%. It's deeply distressing that this level of inequality exists in the UK  particularly given that we are one of the richest countries in the world. Don’t know what poverty feels like? See here.    These figures are pre-COVID-19  and it is projected that the number of children in poverty will increase to 5.2 million by 2022. Families from Black  Asian and minority ethnic communities are more likely to live in poverty; which cannot be separated from wider racial injustices and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on the same groups.     A recent survey from theFood Foundation revealed that 14% of UK families with children have experienced food insecurity in the past 6 months.    What are we doing about it?     Legendary Community Club  which was named by Chevrington Odoh from the Pro Plus FC  is a grassroots project set up by some members of Lewisham Mutual Aid and local organisations. Our aim is to deliver emergency food provision to ensure that children do not miss out  for as long as there is a need.     We will make this happen in three ways:    1. Temporary food banks have been set-up for families who require this support during the school holidays  in partnership with local schools and community groups.    2. Kitchens have been set up to prepare nutritionally balanced meals for young people who would normally receive a meal through their local school or sports club.    3. Campaigning and structural change. We know that food charity is not a long term solution. This is not the world we want to live in and we refuse to normalise food banks as a solution to food poverty. This is NOT an inevitable situation.    With this in mind  we have joined forces with The Children's Society  who have been calling on the government to ensure that every local council adequately funds emergency support for families  demanding that nobody is left with nowhere to turn in a time of crisis. For more information about their campaign 'Strengthening the Safety Net' see here  and sign the petition here.    We are also supporting calls from Save the Children and Child Poverty Action Group who have been lobbying for reforms to the benefits system  an increase in the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit by £20  and an end to the two child limit and the £20 000 a year benefit cap which hits families in high-rent areas such as Lewisham particularly hard.     We are working with the Food Foundation who a part of the newly formed alliance who have backed proposals from the National Food Strategy and are working alongside Marcus Rashford to #ENDCHILDFOODPOVERTY    The way our tax and welfare system is designed is a political choice. There aresolutions. We will call on the government and its representatives to be bold  brave and radical in how they approach this problem.     What will we use the funds for?    We will use the money raised from the community to buy food and equipment for the project. We have a host of volunteers  and multiple clubs and schools signed up and ready to go.

Their neighbour  who is a Leicester City Council tenant  had been using portable generators and it was one of these that had caught on fire which spread to Iqbal's home.     At home at the time were Iqbal's wife and four daughters aged 5-15yrs. Iqbal was at work when the fire broke out and rushed home as soon as he had heard what had happened.       The fire spread into Iqbal's home and the family was forced to evacuate into emergency accommodation. Unfortunately  the family did not settle well into the accommodation due to the overcrowding and stress the family was under. They left the emergency accommodation the following day due to stress and anxiety.      The family stayed with relatives for a couple of weeks in a one bed flat. They knew this was unsustainable with their large family however at least they felt safe. LCC informed their relative that the family couldn't stay any longer due to overcrowding and the family was forced to move out the following day.      The family sofa surfed for a few weeks until they were able to find a vacant property that they could just about afford to rent. The property they found needed a lot of work doing to it and Iqbal put his DIY skills to good use fixing up the property in return for reduced rent. However  it was still 4 months until the family managed to get hot water  heaters and to this day there is still no insulation in the walls.      The effect this has had on Iqbal's family is immense and the young children have been deeply affected by the trauma and chaotic living arrangements  overcrowding and lack of basic services. Iqbals eldest daughter is going through her GCSEs and this whole ordeal has really knocked her confidence and prevented her from focusing on her studies. Iqbals' eldest daughter has been diagnosed with psoriasis and her hair is falling out  doctors' have said this is a direct result of the stress of the fire and the subsequent house moves. The other children are also affected in many different ways.      As Iqbal's home was a private property which unfortunately had no insurance at the time the family is stuck in a real situation where they are unable to buy another home. Leicester City Council has offered to buy the land at less than a third of the market value as long as the family can raise the selling fees. Iqbal is still paying the mortgage and has no additional income or savings to cover the costs of repairs which have been estimated to be £35 000. The house that the fire originated in has now been fully repaired and refurbished by Leicester City Council  yet Iqbal's home is still in ruins and uninhabitable.      Iqbal and his family have been visiting a local food bank at E2 in Beaumont Leys to help them through their situation and have been knocked from pillar to post in their attempts to get this resolved with Leicester City Council which has recently come to a dead end.       If Iqbal was able to raise £35 000 it would mean that his family could get the repairs completed and move back into their home and their children can return to a sense of normality.  ",False

The Club itself is considering a number of online fundraising ideas and as a Member of 10 years plus (as well as being a Member some 20 years ago) I thought to myself what can I do to help ?     All Rotary Clubs are a part of an International grouping of volunteers who give up some of their time to raise funds for and take part in projects designed to help and assist the local communities and internationally.    Bodmin in Cornwall is a charming (former) market town with an active (but ageing !} Rotary Club of 27 Members who raise funds and  in normal times  participate in numerous activities. These are many and varied and include supporting the local food bank and memory cafe as well as assisting young people both educationally and in social development. The Club also supports local fundraising activities of charities such as MNDA  Hospital League of Friends as well as supporting Shelterbox. Internationally numerous other activities have recently included the refurbishment and delivery of a fire appliance to a remote settlement in Albania.    As one clearly in the old fool category I'm not fit enough to run up and down stairs a million times or unaware enough to scoff 200 pancakes in one go (possibly not even a tempting thought) so I looked for a way to help the Club within my capabilities. I live in Bodmin with my wife Carol and have for the last 40 years or so (with the exception of a few days) sported a beard. Since lockdown the relatively manicured hair has grown into a luxuriant beard of which I am quite proud and I thought I could possibly with your help raise some funds for the Rotary Club by having it removed...    My wife is not so keen as she has persistently maintained I would have a facial similarity to a Chipmunk without it ! Hey ho....being of a repressed devil may care personality I thought I'd be a brave Chipmunk and have a sponsored beard shave with all proceeds going to Bodmin Rotary and I'm hoping to raise at least £250 (or as much as possible) to part with Santas pride and joy…....    I feel passionately that local community volunteer organisations are increasingly important in this changing and challenging world and I hope you will feel able to support me in my effort.    I intend to be 'de-Santa' on 5th August and would welcome your sponsorship if only to be able to witness how like a Chipmunk I really am!

The Greenwich Food Bank Fund Right now many of us are understandably feeling anxious and vulnerable  but there are many among us that need immediate support in order to ensure that they can have access to food. Greenwich residents have a proud history of looking after one another - and never has this been more important than now. So I have been working with Greenwich Food Bank to create the Greenwich Food Bank Fund. As the borough faces one of its most important challenges in living memory  the Fund has been set up to ensure that those in need across the borough have access to the help they need. Please  even during this most difficult of times  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Greenwich. Please be assured that even the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference. Thank you for your generosity. FAQs Where will the funds go? The funds will go directly to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by the Greenwich Food Bank and delivered to food banks across the borough  from Blackheath to Eltham  Kidbrooke  Thamesmead and beyond. A full list of food bank locations is available at https://greenwich.foodbank.org.uk/locations/. If I donate will it go directly to those who need it? Yes  your donation will go directly to Greenwich Food Bank. Unlike some other platforms  GoFundMe does not charge a fundraising fee although it takes a small transaction fee. See https://www.gofundme.com/c/free-fundraising for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to. Will the money be spent in Greenwich? Yes. Is there anything else I can do? The most immediate need is to raise finance  so that purchasing can continue. However there is also a need to: (1) donate food where possible; and (2) create a team of delivery drivers as the Food Bank moves to a delivery model.

We urgently need your help to pay for the food costs. Any money you can give will be a fantastic gesture to support people most at need now.     Harissa Kitchen  part of the Newcastle upon Tyne based Food Nation social enterprise CIC (03169228)  is launching a free meals service for vulnerable people living in Byker  Walker  Sandyford  Ouseburn and Heaton  coordinated through the Newcastle City Council’s Citylife Line service to ensure the people most at need get the help.     All vulnerable people in the household will receive 6 days food each week  delivered on Monday  Wednesday and Friday consisting of a breakfast pot  soup and an evening meal. Weekends will also see a special treat of a cake added to the meal. We are expecting to initially serve up 540 free meals a week – and will look to expand this to 900 each week as referrals come through. We are anticipating providing at least 9 900 free meals to people that need the most help over the next three months.    The following people will be provided with support:    · Older people living alone with no other support network; who can’t leave the house due to mobility issues or are self-isolating due to health conditions but haven’t been sent an NHS letter and therefore not eligible for emergency food parcels; or who have no access to internet or cannot order online.  · Families who are self-isolating with virus symptoms with no other support system  have low or no income or can’t get a delivery slot for food.    Some people are in need of ongoing help whilst others need one-off support whilst waiting for delivery slots with supermarkets or for newly unemployed to receive benefits. No one else is offering this support to these isolated people at this scale.     The food is being prepared by trained chefs for free and will provide a varied and nutritionally balanced meals. Food will be delivered by volunteers in re-heatable containers. All food preparation and delivery will fully comply with the Government’s Covid-19 food and safety and working standards.    We are looking for funding to pay for food and volunteer travel costs. The cost for providing this service is £5 a day for one person. Food Nation receives some grant support from Newcastle City Council  but this will not cover the cost of the food or delivery. Volunteer drivers where needed will be able to claim 45p a mile expenses. Where possible we are sourcing reduced cost or donation food to reduce costs.     The cost of providing the food over 3 months is £16 500. We are also applying to local grant funders for help - but this takes time and people need our help now. The more money we raise  the more people we can help.     Food Nation is a well-respected social enterprise (CIC 03169228) that has been working with families and some of the poorest communities in Newcastle upon Tyne  helping them to make healthy food choices and improve their wellbeing. As part of this – we have run a popular community restaurant Harissa Kitchen serving great quality and nutritionally balanced food  whose profits went back into supporting our wider work. Due to the coronavirus situation  we can no longer keep our restaurant open and our premises are not suitable for takeaways.    Please donate to help as we’ve started to receive urgent referrals now. We know times are hard for everyone – but for the people we will support it will really be a lifeline.    · £5 will pay for a days food for a vulnerable person  · £30 will pay for a weeks food for one person    The people identified have no support networks to help them  and are struggling now. This service will provide a much needed short term lifeline. Requests already received include:    - 'I'm visually impaired and autistic. I also have depression  anxiety and Diabetes Type 2. I'm having difficulties getting medication and food and can't get an online delivery slot.'  - 'Me and my 9yr old daughter both have symptoms of COVID 19 and need to self isolate. I need help to get food. I have financial difficulties and am struggling to manage as my next Universal Credit isn't due until 14th April. I don't have enough money to pay for my gas and electric.'  'She has no food at home and has a young daughter and I feel she needs priority. She does not receive any benefits and relies solely on food banks.'    Food Nation are also providing a ‘Food Nation Friend’ befriending service for isolated people and food shopping service for people who can cook but cannot leave the house. They are also linking people into wider support and ensuring they have access to advice and support networks to combat isolation including their newly remodelled Virtual Tuesday Lunch Club.

Yesterday 319 TORIES VOTED AGAINST FREE SCHOOL MEALS The tories wasted 12 billion pounds on a track and trace app that doesn’t even work  YET they apparently do not have the money to feed our poorest children  especially through the toughest winter EVER in the history of the UK. OVER 900 000 children in deprived areas likely to also be surrounded by high covid rates  are still going to bed hungry! This will continue to happen unless the government extends a food scheme!! No child should go to sleep on an empty stomach  worrying about if their parents will be able to feed them tomorrow just like no parent should have to choose between not paying the electricity or water bill in order to feed their child a meal and even then probably starve themselves. So please  rather then ordering that takeout you fancy today  instead of what is cooked at home  put your hand in your pocket  think about how lucky some of us are and how even donating £1 will go a long way. This could be the start of a long term plan to combat child food hunger once and for all. All donations will go directly to Food banks in Sheffield :) ",False

"Nourish - FREE meals for our vulnerable Community","Axminster, South West England, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/Nourish-Axminster,1550,2000,,2019-05-16,,,0,,"My name is Karen and I started a Community Project in Axminster early 2019 called NOURISH(Axminster).    Its unprecedented times with COVID-19 spreading throughout the world and it is most definitely now Nourish  along with the fabulous local community groups pulling together as a whole  needs to step up and support everyone. Its vital that we make sure noone is going without  despite the devastating effect panic buying is having on the vulnerable. People are going without the necessary. Many business's are trying so hard to keep afloat by offering deliveries and takeaways  which is great but only if you have enough money to survive like this.   I will be doing door step deliveries of frozen ready meals  free to absolutely anyone who is struggling. I have had to make some changes to do this and this means sourcing ingredients away from supermarkets and scale up volume which means its going to cost a little bit more financially.     I appreciate that times are going to be hard for many of us but if you could spare a little to help fight the great fight  then I thank you from the bottom my heart - please  stay safe  stay well and together with care  we can get through this.    This is my story should you care to read on :)    I used to work many years ago as a cook and learned so much from my late mum but illness struck and I lost my confidence. Only through volunteering and thanks to the patience of Monkton Wyld Court and to Halff in Axminster in very recent years did I gain my confidence back in a professional kitchen environment.     I myself know what its like to live on the breadline and have watched in horror what the impact of Welfare Reform has done to people in our community and beyond. With benefit sanctions being handed out almost at the drop of a hat  the bedroom tax  disability benefits now even harder to access and Universal Credit people are really struggling. Here in Axminster we have one or two avenues in which to source out food to help us get by when times are hard. Our Food Bank is a wonderful and much needed resource which distributes non perishable foods such as dried rice/pasta  tins and processed foods and other necessities. Once apon a time the need for a food bank would have been a short stop gap  but now  for some  its a weekly ocurrance.     The impact of this continual type of diet not only has an effect on our physical well being (more so if suffering a health issue or illness) but on our mental well being too and then  that spiral of isolation  hopelessness and depression can begin.     Nourish insists each meal must have at least two vegetable components not including onions or potatoes. We cook in bulk and freeze meals in portions and distribute for those to store/cook at home.     We have been surviving on cash donations (and some food donations) given personally by hand by the kind people of Axminster (and even some who dont even live here!!) and its those important donations that allow us to cook meals full of nourishment to compliment the already existing food bank facilities in the town. It is hoped that our meals are a nutritional break without the thought of having to cook. A little bit of love to try to ease people through some really hard and dark times.     Nourish is also putting into plan how to ease ""holiday hunger"" when the schools finish for the summer holidays. Many parents rely on that free school meal in term time to ease the grocery bills and sadly sometimes that is the only meal some children may get.     Any money raised or donated to Nourish will go towards mostly fresh ingredients for our meals. There are some other necessary costs  like the containers and admin materials and occasionally some rent/hire costs.     Incidently  if you are a local grower or allotment user.. please think of us when you have an abundant crop of vegetables and fruits :)    Nourish is working in Axminster and has been met with such positivity and your donation is very very much appreciated.     We are only ever two pay days away from being on the brink..     Thank you    Karen",False

OUR PROJECT IS TO FEED THE NIGHT SHIFT STAFF ON ITU WARDS    WHO WE ARE     We are Joe and Annabelle Colairo and  together with our family  we run a Cafe and Outside Catering company called Masters on Blackfriars Road  London. This is now closed  except for the kitchens  but check us out @ www.masterscatering.co.uk& on instagram @ masterscatering_london      THE PROBLEM      A consultant at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital told us that ""frontline staff were having a terrible and stressful time  working 12-14 hour shifts with no food available to them. The canteens are closed at night. The frontline staff  many of whom live alone  some of whom have to go to food banks  are exhausted after their long shifts "".          (Quotes from Alison Hulme’s texts - she is the Consultant paediatric surgeon who alerted us to this problem.)        “The IT Nurses are most at risk - poor things. I think they are having a gruelling time and so shopping and cooking is just too much for them when they are so low  both physically and emotionally”      “There is no time during shifts for a break  but a meal before or after would be hugely appreciated.”        THE SOLUTION      We specialise in supplying freshly cooked  nutritious and delicious meals. Joe is up at 4 in the morning  sourcing the best produce in New Covent Garden Market.      Since the 28th March  our chefs Sergio  Luis & Cesar have generously and freely volunteered to provide between 40 and 60 hot meals to frontline staff at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and The Royal London Hospital  Mile End.        WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP      Unfortunately we can’t sustain the cost of the food and packaging on our own any longer  and that’s why we need you.      You can be sure that your gift is well spent and it reaches the people most at risk and need.      * We are working on a NOT-FOR-PROFIT basis  * We have all the health  safety and 5* Hygiene certificates  * We know our nutritious meals will help keep the nurses healthier  * We know they will go directly to the nurses who need them most  those on the frontline  * Delivery is arranged by The Chelsham Road Community Association  who have Alison Hulme  a consultant paediatric surgeon  making sure it is delivered directly to the now expanded ITU unit. It goes in at 9pm.  * They also deliver treats  vitamin shots  fresh fruit and also much needed Organic Juice from PIPORGANIC.COM which is being supplied totally for free. The PPE kit is like wearing a plastic bag and dehydration is a problem for the nurses wearing it  * There are no middle men or large corporations taking a cut as with some other organisations  * The cost per meal is £3.50       PLEASE DONATE AND HELP US TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE CARING FOR US      In our experience  there are many donations for frontline staff working during the day  but not for those working at night. Where there are donations of food to the night shift staff  they never make it to them; and that's why we need your help.      “ Someone delivered 15 Pizzas 2 days ago and left them at reception. By the time they got to ITU there were only 2! “      WE KNOW OUR MEALS GET DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO ITU. ( By volunteers every night from Chelsham Road)      Here are some testimonials….      “Every day for the past 2 weeks I have collected 40 delicious wholesome  freshly cooked meals  half of which are vegetarian. The offering is wholeheartedly generous  inventive  varied  nutritious and of great quality.   I met one nurse leaving a 14 hour day shift  who had had some of Joe and Annabelle's meals when she was on night duty. She said “ Oh my goodness  I can’t tell you what a lifeline this is. Who are these people who are so amazing? It means so much to us - it makes me want to cry . I’ve been working all day and only finishing now at 9pm means I haven’t been able to eat all day. It’s like a war zone in there. Thank you  thank you  thank you. This is just what we need.” - Janie from Chelsham Road    ""ITU and theatre nurses are very grateful"" - Ben  Consultant     One of the nurses said they were anxious about getting ill and that its a very worrying time for them. They said the food is amazing and it gives them something to look forward to after a tough shift.      * The cost per meal is £3.50. We deliver 7 days a week which is 280 meals each week to Chelsea and we are looking to raise £980 amount per week.   We have the capacity to deliver more meals to different frontline staff in other hospitals if we have the funds and only if we have the direct access with the frontline staff and operating theatre night managers. Your money will go towards meals for those that need it most.       Thank you so much for making this possible.      Yours faithfully    Joe and Annabelle",False

These months of enforced homeschooling have revealed the many barriers facing low-income families (incl. job losses  food insecurity  housing issues  domestic abuse  family bereavements and many more…). The closure of libraries and community cafes that were previously used for learning  job applications and other resources has further worsened this divide  with many people struggling to access information on where to get help. Many families have been left with no access to a laptop to continue their children’s learning and larger families have struggled to share one computer between parents working from home and multiple children needing access to online learning. since schools have started to reopen  we have seen numerous amount of families still struggling for devices for their children  hence our determination to continue with this project to help families. we have recently teamed up with tutors around differnt boroughs to provide online learning for children with the aim for children to be supported with learning they have missed out on. we aim to continue to support famillies to help make a difference to their lives.

We are aiming to raise £2000 in a short period of just two weeks to ensure that each and every family in Hartlepool who are in need of a little help at Christmas receive a Christmas gift. Can you imagine  as you sit at home this evening surrounded by your Children who have probably already written their Christmas lists and sent them off to Santa not receiving a single gift on Christmas morning? Unfortunately this is a reality for families in our home town but YOU can change that by making a donation. I am going to be working very closely with Childrens Services at Hartlepool Borough Council to ensure that we target families that are most in need. I may be slightly ambitious here but the hope is the target will be smashed and and any funds left over will be given to the local soup kitchen and food bank in their 'leaner' months of January and February.    A local business man who wants to remain completely anonymous came up with the idea of 'The Nothing But Love' campaign. Wanting to give something back for absolutely zero in return he wanted to give a £1000 of his own cash to go to local families who are in genuine need but without any 'thanks' or shouting from the rooftops just wanting to do a selfless  good dead. The idea of the 'Nothing But Love' Campaign was born.    So of course want to donate  right? Well  here is the catch - You give COMPLETELY ANONYMOUSLY. That's right  you get absolutely nothing in return other than the warm glow inside of knowing you have done a truly brilliant thing. We ask that if you donate to the page you just pop your initials in rather than your name. We like to think of it as people helping people. We are hoping that local business people will look to donate very generously. If you are unable to donate if you could share the Facebook page with anyone who you think may be able to support that would be very much appreciated.    Thank you for taking the time to read and please help me spread the word to ensure we make it the best Christmas we can for everyone in our local community.

The post involved me telling a little about my life since losing my wife Michelle.     She was 37yrs old. She died after the flu virus caused a massive cardiac arrest. She died in front of me in Whiston hospital and the A & E team struggled for six minutes to bring her back. They did manage to do so and she survived a further 7 days before a brain scan shown irreparable brain damage and I was told there was nothing could be done for her. We withdrew care on Easter Sunday 2016.     Michelle (like myself) was a primary school teacher. As such  following her death I have recieved a small pension from her. Every month since she passed awaya I try to use some of the money I receive from her pension to help a cause that catches my eye in her memory. These are usually things like friends running marathons  park benches in memory of people who have died or other things that touch me.     This month my son Billy and me decided we should do something about the number of people in our local area who simply do not have enough food in their homes to feed their families. So we used some of the money from Michelle's pension and the money we would have spent on Christmas dinner (as we have been invited to a friends house) to buy all sorts of 'stuff' to give to our local food bank. We bought tinned veg  nappies  sanitary towels  baby wipes and UHT milk. It felt great doing this. Money well spent.     Someone asked me to post 'our efforts' in the group and the response was unbelievable. It seems to have touched the hearts of many people. 4500+ (and climbing) reactions  hundreds of shares. I was amazed. I have had several people send me money via my paypal account and many more ask how they can help. So I thought as I had perhaps unwittingly created a platform to help people out I would ask for that help via a GoFundMe page. I think that's how people do these things now?    One of the emails I had was from someone who sent me £2 with an apology. 'I am sorry it isn't more.' I wrote back to say £2 will never ever 'not be enough'. If £2 is what you can afford to give then £2 is enough. £2 is amazing. £2 could help turn someone's life around. So yep...I am asking for £2. More if you can afford it...less if I am asking too much. My point is...it does not matter how much. What matters is you did.     So there it is. I am not sure how successful this will be but if everyone who reacted to my initial post gave £2 that would double the amount I am trying to raise. To be fair...how much I put in the box isnt a goal. My goal is to raise as much as I can to buy food and other essential items for people who need it. If it's another £2 then that's 4 packets of sanitary towels...if it is another £200 then that is trolleys full of food. £2000 and I think we may be genuinely changing lives. Something everyone could take pride in.     I would ask this one thing though...I would ask that if you do decide to donate to this fund raising that you do not hide your name. I want to know who you are. I want my son to see you. This is as much about helping me in #makingaman out of my boy as it is helping people you don't know eat.

When we were little  growing up in the 90’s  my siblings and I had free school meals  through middle school and high school  and I know how thankful my mum was of these free lunches. We had very little money This was back in the day where very little money meant just that. We didn’t have SKY TV  or mobile phone bills and my mum would go without food so that we could have new clothes and didn’t get bullied at school. These were the days when the supermarkets had a price war on tins of their own brand baked beans Anyone remember that? When they went so low  that at one point they were 1p! Yes 1p! And my mum would take me and my siblings and we would go in separately and purchase 6 tins each (the maximum you were allowed to buy) for a penny each. Because baked beans could really fill out any meal  and was the cheapest thing to buy. I still remember this to this day. ☺️          Some might say  if you can’t afford to feed your kids  then why have them? But right now there are so many families who  6 months ago were absolutely fine. And we know this first hand through work that Aron is involved with alongside the shop. We know that there are families  who have lost their jobs and can’t find a new one. Or families that haven’t had any help from the government through this whole Covid situation. There are families now using food banks because they don’t have enough money to go shopping. This is not a child’s fault. No-one chose for this year to pan out the way it did. And as such we want to help.           Each year  normally at Christmas we do something for the local food banks or food charities. Although this year  our business has been hit super hard with the huge number of postponements of weddings  and the uncertainty of peoples buying habits  we know that our children won’t go hungry this half term. And so we want to give back.           We know we’re a little late  but really it’s never to late to help. We want to donate 15 food parcels  including food for lunches this week as well as some essential foods  to families who are really struggling. So...          If you know a family that are visiting food banks.     If you’re a family that don’t know how you’re going to feed your kids this holiday.     If you’re a teacher who knows of a family who needs a little help          Then please message us privately to arrange collection of a small food parcel. There will be no judgement from anyone here. Parcels will be ready to collect this Monday & Tuesday between 10-4 at the shop.           As much as we’d like to help as many people as we can  unfortunately we need to keep this local  to families in Poole and Bournemouth.           No child should go to bed hungry     Each food parcel will be worth £15  but what ever you can donate will help       (If you’re a business who wants to help and donate any parcels  please message us privately)",False

Being part of a coastal economy is always difficult over the winter months  but the impact of COVID-19 is potentially catastrophic. Every time we ask a family to self-isolate with COVID symptoms  we’re essentially asking them to spend 14 days in a cold flat with no food. Very few of our families have a support network to rely on  because they are fleeing gang  drug or domestic violence in other parts of the UK; this means that most left their extended support network behind in Birmingham  Liverpool or Glasgow  in order to live in a place with no available infrastructure to deal with the escalating child poverty that’s been growing since the 1980s. All of our families live no more than 2 days ahead as far as food is concerned; they can’t afford to bulk shop and they don’t have a fridge or freezer to fill with supplies. Many of the young women we work with receive their feminine hygiene products from us as a school via the “Red Box” programme. Without that support  they have NO ACCESS to female hygiene products. Any period of time away from a free school meal means no access to food at the best of times; a second national or local lockdown will be catastrophic. Last time the country locked down (in March/April) we had parents ringing us in tears because they had no income  no food and (very frequently) no electricity to power the laptops that the government provided for remote learning. If this surprises you  it probably shouldn’t  because there are very many schools like ours. However  in this particular case you CAN help if you choose to. Please consider donating to our food bank; no donation is too small. We started with a small bunch of shopping bags  intending to provide a “Lockdown Survival Box” to every family we have to ask to self-isolate.

The Rev Mandy Brown and her team at Holy Trinity Church in South Street offer practical and emotional comfort and support to those in need.    It cost £28 000 to run the shelter last year. The tight budget means manager David Perry is employed for just 13 hours a week  but he dedicates many more to reaching out to homeless people as soon as the team become aware of their difficulties.    Rev Brown said: ""We are unable to open all year round because the number of volunteers we would need would be phenomenal. We would need a huge amount of money to pay a full-time manager and we just don't have it.""    However  with the help of up to 300 volunteers  they are able to offer a safe haven each night during the worst of the winter for up to 12 guests.    Rev Brown is anxious that the help offered is more than a temporary sticking plaster.    ""Once we open we will keep going to the end of March – we have a very long season  one of the longest [of any winter night shelter] "" she said.    ""Experience tells us that the worst of the bad weather comes later than it used to. But we use that time to be able to work with people and to help people connect and reconnect. We need the time to build up the trust and the love that's required to be able to work with someone.    ""Just providing a roof over somebody's head does not resolve the challenges they are facing. It's just the beginning. The shelter is a conduit to other resources – to housing  to drug and alcohol rehabilitation and even using the contact centre to reconnect people to their children and families "" she said. That support continues even when guests are off the street.    As part of its mission to provide the best possible services  the shelter is regularly inspected by Housing Justice and was rated 'excellent' at the last visit. ""We are very proud of that "" said Rev Brown. ""We work very closely with Housing Justice and we follow all their guidelines.""    Each day  the shelter  now a registered charity  needs two overnight volunteers each night  three lunchtime and four evening helpers  plus an extra pair of hands during the day to collect food donated by businesses. Those who can spare just a few hours to play cards or board games or just chat are very welcome.    David said: ""You don't have to know how to resolve someone's issues – just come and be a friend.""    He is training volunteers who have already come forward but is anxious to recruit more and set up induction sessions for them too.    Not all roles are client-facing – the shelter also needs help with laundry  housekeeping  pantry stock rotation and preparing meals on the premises each evening. New recruits to the catering crew have been busy securing food hygiene certificates.    Rev Brown said: ""It's wonderful to come in out of the cold and for the guests to smell home-cooked meals coming out of the kitchen.""    The shelter's doors open each night from 8pm and guests leave at 7.30am  unless the weather is particularly bad. Lunch is on offer from 11am until 2pm. The shelter offers activities such as art therapy as well as advice on issues including mental health and addiction.    Over the past five years  since the shelter first opened  the team have built up a wealth of practical experience and a network of experts who can help address the complex issues which lead to an individual living on the streets.    They work closely with Citizens Advice  Bishop's Stortford Food Bank at the Methodist church  alcohol and drug rehabilitation professionals and East Herts Council's housing options officer for rough sleepers.    The team also partner with other churches  such as the Salvation Army  which provides vouchers so shelter-users can pick their own clothes from the good cause's shop in South Street.    David has a small selection of garments so that anyone turning up in wet clothes can change into something dry  warm and clean  but because space is tight  the shelter is unable to store donations of clothes  which are best directed to the town's charity shops.    The shelter has ample supplies of towels and beddings and uses special fold-up beds  which can be cleaned easily.    It does  however  always welcome donations of tea  coffee and biscuits  which are always in short supply  plus books and games for the guests.

Half of the walking duo that decided back in November 2019 to walk 10 000 steps every day  starting from the 1st January 2020. For those of you have followed us from the start  you might know this  but we thought we’d give the back story of how this came about…     I’ve been friends with Brian Snr on Facebook for a while now  and every year since 2012 he has attempted to walk 10 000 steps a day  every day  for as long as possible. Like we do now  he always reported daily to prove that he was one step closer to his end goal. It started off as a way for him to lose weight and get fit. He quickly gathered support from friends and family  liking the posts  commenting messages of support  and one particular follower (me!) started posting silly hashtags #TeamScullySnr #WalksForDays #HeAlwaysWalksAlone becoming some of my favourites.     Brian’s previous record was 142 days back in 2016.    Fast forward to November 2019. Brian Jnr and I met up in London to watch a show at the o2. As Brian Snr works in the city  we arranged to meet up at the pub at Kings Cross station. I had to ask the question that people that had seen his posts for the last few years  were dying to know ‘are you going to walk again next year?’ Brian was unsure.     I quickly came out with ‘if you do it  I’ll do it with you’ – I might have been a couple of pints/gins in at this point! Brian Jnr laughed. Claimed that we’d never be able to do it. So confident  that he wagered £100. If we both walked 10 000 steps a day  for 143 days  he would pay us £50 each. The bet was made and the challenge set.     I’ll be honest  the only day I’d walked 10 000 steps last year  was that day in London. And I got no-where near it again for the rest of November and December. First of January came and I was worried what I had got myself into!    On Friday 22nd May 2020  we’d done it! No-one had ever heard of coronavirus back in November when this was discussed. Through all dark  cold and wet nights  to the country going into lockdown and only being allowed out once a day to exercise  we’d managed to still walk 10 000 steps every.single.day.    It had never been about the money for us. We streamed a zoom call between the three of us to Facebook live and announced that we wanted to donate the money to a local Peterborough charity. Brian Snr lives just outside of Peterborough  and although I now live in Bournemouth  I grew up in Market Deeping  so it seemed like a no-brainer. Amazingly  our dear friend Maxine offered to match Brian Jnr’s donation too!    We’ve had so much amazing support  and with the excitement and emotion that came on that day  we somehow managed to sign up for another 143 days!! Our new target date is Monday 12th October 2020. We have another £100 wagered with Brian Jnr.    Thank you so much if you’ve managed to read this far. And please if you can  help us raise as much money possible for all the amazing work Give Back Peterborough do in their local area.

I believe I suffered a mini-stroke when I was most sick and am continuing to struggle with widespread pain  migraines and neurological symptoms  fatigue and exhaustion after only light activity. Unfortunately  my health has resulted in unforseen spending. Person I used to live with threw even more debt my way in recent months. I didn't anticipate this malicious behaviour to continue — three different debt advisers have described me as a ""sitting duck.""    The consequence is my outgoings have risen unexpectedly and lockdown has eliminated my ability to work overtime or find another job meaning that I'm unable to pay bills again. Because I can't make regular usage payments or repay debts I've been repeatedly threatened with gas and electricity disconnection which is now imminent. I fear what will happen as lockdown is eased further. I am receiving ongoing debt advice but honestly there's little that can be done without clearing these debts *and* increasing my income  which is why I've decided to post another update  raise the goal and restart this fundraiser. I hoped your support would be enough for me to get back on my feet  but my situation is precarious. ---     *Original text from August 2019* This is incredibly difficult to write  but I need to ask my friends  acquaintances and perhaps even some people whom I don’t know  to help me get through the next few months. The situation is going to escalate rapidly because my employer is deducting more than 25% of my pay from September onwards  to recover two overpayments they made in error for a really long period  without me or payroll noticing.    I’m already on a low income and have been trying to find a more stable job. Until now I’ve been working two jobs  but my temporary one is coming to an end and I will only have my permanent job – where they have persistently threatened to dismiss me on health grounds so aside from the overpayment recovery  I just can’t hold on there for much longer.    Whenever I do give my notice or get dismissed  they’ll take the entirety of my final month’s pay.    I live alone but the person I used to cohabit with left substantial utility bill debts at our home that I didn’t become aware of until later. There’s not enough space to move another person in  and I can’t move out right now for financial and contractual reasons.    Because of an active police investigation that I can’t go into  I’ve already borrowed money for unexpected costs like home security  numerous phone calls to charities and agencies offering professional advice  and private therapy which I had to quit.    My health has dramatically worsened – I’ve been to a&e twice in the past fortnight because of a kidney infection that didn’t respond to treatment and I had to pawn things to pay for my antibiotics  but there’s not much of value left for me to sell.    I need to wear glasses but have been doing without for several months since they broke; I’m doing without a lot of things. One of my cats needs dental surgery soon but this isn’t going to be possible. My mobile phone has also broken.    I earn slightly too much to claim benefits or get free prescriptions and despite years of hospital referrals  I am still fighting for a diagnosis to explain my physical health problems so I’m not currently eligible for any support that could be claimed.    Unfortunately I’m estranged from one parent  not currently on good terms with the other who wouldn’t help anyway  and I don’t have regular contact with my extended family.    I don’t have savings and I wouldn’t realistically be able to repay any further money borrowed.    Up to this point I’ve managed to keep on top of the rent and buy cat food but I have now begun going without my own food  even before overpayment recovery has started. I’m hoping to access a food bank next week but the period I can use them for will be limited.    It’s hard to put a figure on how much help I should ask for  since my only realistic solution is finding a job with an employer that can offer greater flexibility and is more considerate towards people with chronic health needs. But I am hopeful that if I can just get straight with the money I already owe and raise some more to buy myself time whilst finding a better job  then I can make things work.      *Updated October 2019* I began asking for help one month ago. I am starting a new job in November; I left my employer because they were threatening to dismiss me on health grounds and had also begun to deduct more than 25% of my pay. However I have been panicking instead of celebrating  because they are going to take the entirety of my final month’s pay and my union have confirmed I can't stop them. The support that people have offered me this past month has been wonderful; it enabled me to cover a significant shortfall when my employer started their recovery  ensuring my overdraft was replenished  my rent paid and my cats fed.    But I must raise more before the end of October or I will lose my home. As well as replacing an entire month's income  I also need to fight off utility disconnection and take my cat to the vets.    I have received extensive debt/housing/welfare advice and there's nothing can be done to prevent this situation from happening.    Thank you for reading all the way down; I am extremely grateful to anyone who can donate or share this page. I don’t have many followers and would really appreciate people making this more visible.",False

We have no overheads during the trial phase so everything you donate will go directly to providing food to families and children in real need of a meal. The trial phase will begin as soon as we can feed one family and we hope  with your support  to feed 100!     For just £5 you can feed a child a two course meal in a warm  welcoming environment. For another £5 you can feed their brother or sister a further £7  their parent(s) too.

On Monday 20th April most children in the UK would have been going back to school to start the summer term. With the whole country in lockdown due to COVID-19 and no end to this currently in sight  it is expected that kids will miss at least a few weeks of school  if not half a term or possibly even a full term. The schools have all been amazing in sending out resources and setting up online learning but not all children are able to access these  or have supplies at home to be able to continue their learning  or even keep themselves entertained  during lockdown.    With many families now facing financial difficulties  it is not possible for all children to get supplies such as reading books  stationery  craft supplies and workbooks. We are aiming to raise funds to put together packs of key resources for kids who need them to make sure that they can continue their education and  more importantly  find things to keep them entertained during this ongoing lockdown period. We are working with the Potters Bar Food Bank who will distribute these packs to any families that need them.

My Mum found herself on Universal Credit after being unfit to work. She was having investigative treatment to identify what ""arthritis"" she had in her knee to begin with. As time passed on UC  her quality of life deteriorated rapidly. She sat in the cold (no money for heat)  the dark (No money for electric or TV Licence) so she spent months alone in her increasingly flea infested home (No money to pay council fee for extermination). Eventually  the fleas got so bad she ended up with (what we later found out was) Sepsis from the bites. Mum weighed under 7 stone and was very poorly  but still expected to fight at a tribunal ALL her money was stopped at this point.  2. I took Mum out of the property and brought her to live with me. I nursed her bites and fed her and our family off my business revenue for months. To the point my business  Hinch Hauls Delivery Ltd has had to cease trading I worked tirelessly day and night to build an exciting  successgul business from scratch and I was more proud than I have ever been.   3. Mum was diagnosed with final stage Bone Cancer and given a very short expectancy so not only was she diying but she had to die in poverty through no fault of her own. Lee and I had to battle the HM revenue for Mums money which was paid to her a week before she died by which time she was bed ridden unable to spend anything She was also told following diagnosis that she couldn't have any treatment at all  she wasn't suitable and their reasons.....? She was too underweight to be able to cope with radiotherapy.  5. Following her Cancer diagnosis  she visited the hospital via A&E a number of times unable to breathe as the cancer spread through her lungs and bones. Every time  she was left on a corridor crying  coughing up blood  wetting herself  screaming in pain and we were told...""there's no beds"" The images circulating of that boy being treated on the floor is NOTHING to what my Mum endured and many other poor people I have witnessed.   6. Mum had a final payment of £650 which was for the rent  paid to her account but bounced back as her acc had already been closed. I called Universal Credit to request the payment be sent to me and they told me she died a day too early to be entitled to the money  had she lived a full 28 days out of the month she would be entitled to it but she died a day early and do is entitled to NOTHING?   7. I am trying to declare bankruptcy as we have had to take the revenue from my business to pay for my diying Mother. We used a food bank on Wednesday another low we've sunk to There is no help for us apparently but plenty of bailiffs at the door trying to take our things...AND FOR WHAT!!!? TAKING TIME TO TAKE CARE OF MY MUM AS SHE DIES!!?   I am DREADING Christmas when my kids ask why they didn't get many gifts compared to their friends  dreading my mum not being here.  We're living a nightmare and I can really relate to the UC suicides happening all over  there is really no way out :(     I know Christmas is round the corner and everyone has their own presents and things to buy for but if anybody can find it in their heart to contribute anything I know it would mean the world to Jodeane and her family..

So the idea is simple plan your trip based at home  prepare everything you need to go camping  stay overnight on the drive in your van  a tent in your garden  or even in your house (but it must be set up like a camping trip)  or in your caravan.     So how do we raise funds ?   Donate a minimum of £5 in the pot or the amount you would normally have paid for a night camping at your favourite spot during the bank holiday weekend.

He runs Bean and Nothingness  seemingly voluntarily as it's not financially successful yet  but it and this group has been such a force for good in our community  so maybe we're measuring success by the wrong metric.    That said  money is a necessary evil  and when I saw Rich's recent post about being denied universal credit and being desperate the other day  I figured we as a community might want to give a pound or two to help him and his son get through this tough time.    Rich didn't know this was happening  in fact I was told by admin that he'd hate it  but tough  this is what we do for mates when they're going though a tough time.    Yes  of course there are plenty of other people suffering and deserving. It's heartbreaking  and it shouldn't be the case  but that's where we as a community need to be looking for opportunities to help each other out. I reached out to the OHOAC community as I thought that we might like to have the opportunity of showing appreciation for the efforts Rich has put into putting gigs on  cultural events  collecting for food banks  helping the homeless in many ways  and creating this space in which we can all have a laugh and an argument!    You don't have to donate  you might prefer to help somebody else who's in need  and that's great  please do that.

All proceeds from download sales and donations will go to the charity's UK Coronavirus Response Appeal.    How it all happened …    Shortly after KanOwurmz formed in 2015  keyboard player Giordano Girotto dusted off an instrumental piece he had written years earlier under the working title ""Hope"" and shared it with the rest of the band. Songwriter Debbie Elliott then locked herself away with copious cups of tea to add the lyrics and melody line and  soon afterwards  the band began performing the song live at venues across Yorkshire.    In April 2020  three weeks into the coronavirus lockdown  the band members decided to put a song together to raise money for a UK charity. The British Red Cross was chosen because of the work it was doing to help those in need during the crisis  including working with food banks and teaming up with supermarkets to get surplus stock to those who need it most. ""Hope"" was the perfect song choice  but Debbie changed the lyrics to reflect the difficult situation everyone was facing  while injecting a sense of positivity and gratitude at the same time.     Initially  everyone thought it would take just a few days to get the song ready for release  but how wrong they were! The project turned out to be a huge learning curve for all five band members - recording individually at home with click tracks (the band still haven't met since their last gig in March)  learning how to use the recording software (with huge compatibility issues)  trying to help each other over the phone and WhatsApp  and mixing and producing the final version. Of course  putting a slideshow video together for the first time was another story  but it's now ready for release on YouTube and includes images of York's empty city centre during the early stages of lockdown. Every ounce of effort has been worth it and  all things considered  everyone involved is quite amazed by the result! The band had been looking forward to playing a string of gigs this year in and around York  including the Rockin’ all over the Wold festival in Easingwold on 11 July  but working on a project like this has allowed them to stay creative and share something new with their followers  old and new.    ""Hope (Lockdown Session)"" is available to download from 3 July 2020:  Amazon  Anghami  Apple Music  MediaNet  Deezer  Google Play  iHeartRadio  ClaroMusica  iTunes  KKBox  Napster  NetEase  Pandora  Saavn  Spotify  Tidal and Tik Tok/Resso.

Although we are trying our level best in treating patients affected by covid-19 in hospital  I feel that there is a lot more we need to do to help these patients in hospital as well as those affected by this pandemic in the community.    Many people are temporarily out of jobs and are struggling to make ends meet. Basic necessities such as food supply and toiletries for many families has become a burden. Families are having to resort to food banks to ensure that their families have something to eat. However  food banks are also in major crisis as they are opening their doors to more people than ever before during this covid-19 pandemic. Provisions that they would normally be supplying per week is now being distributed within a day.     At the same time  many patients in hospital are taking their last breaths of life alone without any relatives beside their side. Families are yearning to see and hear the voices of their loved ones fighting this disease in hospital alone. Yet  due to the highly contaminated nature of this disease  many hospitals are reluctantly having to stop normal hospital patient visiting times. Many patients with a background of dementia and/or Alzheimer's find it very difficult to understand why they are in hospital and what is happening to them. More so  being in an unfamiliar hospital environment without any families visiting them makes it even more difficult for them in aiding their recovery. It breaks my heart that families cannot come to see their loved ones knowing that they are in their last few hours or days of life.     The reason I am setting up this fund raising page is to help both patients and families to be connected in the hospital as well as those affected by covid-19 in the community. The money we raise will be used for two primary causes:    1) To collect enough money to buy food and basic toiletries that can be distributed to local food banks to keep up the pressure of ensuring that nobody goes hungry during this covid-19 pandemic.     2) To collect enough money to buy electronic ipads  phones and phone chargers for patients to stay connected through face-time with their families on the outside whilst they are fighting off this disease alone in hospital.

My daughter Amanda Bruce is a victim of a situation similar to that of the wind rush generation. She was made stateless in February 2016 and was unable to work  lost her job and unable to claim any benefits until the resolution in May 2018 and was given a passport within 24 hours of calling the wind rush hotline and reinstating her right to work. I am a British citizen   as was my partner. We went on a family holiday to Australia for a year (as my partners both again British parents emigrated to in the 1960 s)where my daughter was born. We returned to the UK when she was just 6 months old and has spent her entire life in this country  worked from the age of 16  paid her taxes all up until February 2016. Amanda is a hard working single mother of 2 children  she has struggled to keep the roof over her and her children’s family home in which they have lived for over 10 years . The past 2 years with no income have left her in tremendous debt. Unable to pay council tax which is now in arrears of £2 500 and her rent which is now in arrears of £2000. During the period of being unable to work or claim  my daughter prioritised feeding her son and daughter with the money friends  family and the children’s father although separated; all while sometimes starving her self and paying what little she could to keep the house as the council could not help her in any way due to the fact she was not classed as a British citizen by the government(and was unable to even claim food bank vouchers as she was not in receipt of any benefits due to being left stateless) . My daughter is now faced with the threat of eviction from her private rent company and is unable to be rehoused by the council due to the arrears over the 2 years she could not pay them (a catch 22 situation) . Bailiffs are a common sight knocking on her doors and she fears for her son and daughters well being. We do not come from a rich family  we are working class people and have struggled to keep the rent paid to date but have fallen behind and struggling to get the money together to keep the house. The Christmas holidays are coming up and while many will be celebrating  I know that my daughter will be having many sleepless nights fearing the risk of losing everything through no fault of her own. We are distraught at the way our own government has treated us over these past 2 years; when a hard working individual is victimised by the very system they have worked in for over 20 years. We ask you today for help. All we want for Christmas this year is to know that my daughter and my grandchildren will sleep in their own beds on Christmas Eve. If you wish to read more on this story  the article can be found on the evening telegraph website. I would also like to note that the wind rush compensation scheme(to which was our only means of calling the hotline to get this horrid situation finally sorted) is still in the works and we have been told it could take over 5 years to receive a penny if any ; the threat of eviction is immediate and we worry how long it will be before they are homeless. We hope you can find it in your hearts to help us in our time of need and we thank you all sincerely for taking the time to read my daughters horrific story.

The lockdown and Covid 19 have been particularly difficult on many BAME  low income and isolated families here in Edinburgh. In June 2020 ELREC started a food project to help bridge the gap between BAME people and food poverty and access to free food services such as food banks. This came about after ELREC was contacted by many community members asking for food support due to job losses  furlough  redundancies  and benefits income not being sufficient to live on for many families and also children being at home fulltime.    ELREC provided this work thanks to local funding but this has now ended  yet the demand for food parcels and halal meat for BAME families remains.

Therefore  ELREC is asking for funds to top up their food support with specific items they need such as halal meat  nappies  baby milk or any other essential items.     Covid has only made matters worse with new data showing that 14% of adults living with children reported experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity in the last 6 months. Four million people including 2.3 million children live in these households. This compares to pre-Covid-19 levels of 11.5% amongst households with children.    The data revealed that 12% of adults living with children reported skipping meals because they could not afford or access food in the last 6 months.    4% of adults living with children reported having gone for a whole day without eating in the last 6 months.    10% of parents/guardians  affecting an estimated 1.9 million children  reported some form of child food insecurity in the past 6 months. Despite people returning to work and children to school  food insecurity remains extremely high for families.    While vital measures like the furlough scheme and Free School Meal vouchers may have prevented the situation worsening  a large number of children are still left in a precarious situation when it comes to securing the necessary healthy diet for them to grow  develop and participate actively in school and society. We want food equality for all  regardless of background.     Please donate what you can and help us keep doing this important work for our community. No child should go hungry and we pledge to use your donations to provide food support all year round  not just term time.

My Dad  James Yule  recently turned 81 and  being on housebound lockdown for 12 weeks  he decided to do Couch to 5k on the back garden path.    (When my friends heard about Major Tom’s 100 laps for NHS  they thought it was my Dad!) Why?  Someone  BP  from a group he’s on  posted on the group page that - even though James didn’t ask for it - BP wants to sponsor him to complete his challenge  and he offered a donation to a charity of James’s choice!    This gave James his altruistic idea - That if people would like to encourage him to do it  by way of sponsorship  and other people can benefit from what he’s doing  then why would he get in the way of such generosity?!    As food and basic health needs are so fundamental/crucial for the people in the world who are most struggling  he would like the raised monies to go to the local food bank and/or care needs in the community.  St. Andrews Foodbank says:    “Those we serve may have lost their job  had a family split up  be victims of domestic violence  or had benefits delayed or suspended. In desperate times we are able to meet their immediate need for food.”  May we extend our human kindness to them.    How?  So  to make it easier for you to give  if you feel inclined  I’ve set up this page.    I will post updates between now and the end of May  by which he hopes to be able to complete a 5km run  actually running  for the half hour that the programme builds runners up to (and do the remainder by whichever means)!    What makes this a challenge  you might ask?   Doesn’t James do the Parkrun?    Indeed  James has done the Parkrun  before  and consistently since my Mum died  a year ago today  20th April.    He also has angina  a heart condition which makes running that bit more challenging for his body. So he will be doing it gradually/sustainably.    His mind/heart  whilst keeping it fit and agile - as well as desiring to support other people in the community to be well and healthy - is determined. How can you help?    With the challenge food banks face in receiving food from their usual sources (church congregations  supermarkets etc)  you giving money to this cause will ensure food banks are stocked  and people who need the support they offer can still access it.

The island is an island of tourism  many of the inhabitants come from the other islands in Cape Verde to work and rely on the wealth of the world for their survival. The island is poor at the best of times  relying solely on tourism. The wages are low but the cost of living is the same as the UK  if not more. Some essential items like Paracetamol can cost an average of £5 per packet  completely unaffordable by the locals. Like the rest of the world  the island is now in quarantine  but this means the islanders are not allowed to leave to travel back to their native islands and live with their families. Without tourism  the locals are without wages and money or financial aids to support themselves - yet are expected to live and survive on next-to-nothing. There have been a few charities set up and have already started to hand out some food to the families  but it's not enough. With majority of supplies coming from overseas and high demand  the local shops have doubled their prices  so food is considerably more expensive and unafforadable for most. My daughter  Chiara often says to me ""Mum  you can't save everybody"" and of course I know she's right. Whilst I know money is tight in the UK and around the world  I just cannot ignore how these locals  who depend on the rest of the world must feel. I feel compelled to try to help them  hence this ""gofundme"" page. The monies will go directly to the locals to buy basic food  of rice  vegetables  water and supplies and distributed to the families in need. I hope you will consider their plight and help  any small donation will help and be a significant difference to those who need it the most. There will be difficult months ahead until tourism replenishes the island again  but they are the most fantastic and beautiful hosts. The islanders of Boa Vista will welcome you and any guests with open arms  today and always - so much you will never want to leave their beautiful island. Lastly  I thank you for taking the time to read this on behalf of the locals whom depend on tourism for survival. Myself  like everyone else really hope we can all return to what was once normal life soon  but in the meantime let’s do our best to look after those who treat us with nothing but love and kindness.

"Rooftop Country & Grime Concert","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/rooftop-country-amp-grime-concert,580,580,,2020-09-07,,,0,,"  Hello - I’m singer/songwriter James Riley  and since the start of lockdown this year I’ve been live streaming weekly concerts from my roof in Tottenham  North London  to raise money for UK Food Banks.       We’ve had some amazing moments up on the roof - a country band  a brass band  a choir  as well as coverage from national media including the BBC and several viral clips online.    After 20 weeks of rooftop shows at the end of September I’ll finally be bringing this season of concerts to a close. So to make sure we go out with a bang - I’ve decided to make the last couple shows on September 11th & 18th really special.   I’m going to collaborate on these last shows with Grime MC’s from my local area of Tottenham. As a folk/country artist primarily  this is a really exciting prospect to me. It’s a chance to reach out beyond my musical comfort zone  and to create something new  spontaneous  and which speaks to the moment we’re collectively living through. I don’t know how folk and grime are going to sound when combined - but I’m very excited to find out.       I also feel like it’s a chance to create an encounter between parts of my neighbourhood that might not always have that much to do with one another - and with any luck to foster a sense of togetherness through the power of music.      To pull this off we need to upgrade our live streaming set-up significantly. Every week since the start of April I’ve been broadcasting the shows from my phone - but to capture a concert on this scale  involving a full country band and MC's across 3 rooftops - we need to hire a multi-camera set up  with professional audio. A collaboration like this will also involve rehearsals and musicians fees. I’m doing all of this at absolutely the lowest possible cost I can - but in all honesty we’re still a little over a grand away from covering costs.       So in order to make this a reality - I’m asking for your help to balance the books - anything that you feel able to chip in towards making this goal a reality  will be received with enormous gratitude and appreciation. Anything that we make above the goal will go directly to our wonderful partners #LiveForLove  the campaign to support UK Food Banks  for whom we’ve played 18 shows and counting!       Thanks for checking this out. I feel like we’ve got a unique opportunity to create something really special here before the end of summer. If this sounds like something you'd like to support  and you feel able to chip in  be a part of it and and help us pull off - huge gratitude and appreciation are in order. THANK YOU.",False

It was originally built in the early 1900’s as a Temperance Hall  since then it has had a plethora of uses  most recent of which left the building in a semi-derelict condition which included severe fire damage.    However  following its acquisition by The Tab Church  fresh ideas began to surface as to how it might be rescued  restored  and adapted to suit the needs for modern usage as Church  Community and Conferencing facility.    The ‘Tab1Milli’ is what will enable this most significant part of the Big Build project vision to become a reality  and the building actually able to be used.

We are therefore asking you to join with us through radical generosity  as together we step out in faith towards hitting the £1Million target by continually bringing our financial gifts together now and over the coming weeks and months.    Once the entire building is renovated  it will enable The Tab to continue and expand its traditional church functions and community initiatives  which are not limited to but currently include:  · Sunday services  · Kids church for children  · Crèche during the Sunday services  · Weekly prayer meetings  · Christian education and classes  · Administrative offices  · Bookshop/resources  · Food Bank – hosting Lewisham Central’s foodbank and distribution point. This is currently offered two-three times a week  staffed by 8-12 volunteers.  · Youth mentoring – support for vulnerable young people in the local community.  · Community action team (Restoration Empowerment and Community Help) – which focuses its support and resources on three vulnerable groups in Lewisham:  The elderly (offering days out and grocery food supplies);  The homeless (offering food clothing to those living on the streets)  and  Women and children escaping from domestic abuse (offering support).    *The Big Build Project includes the overall vision of Tabernacle Global Ministries and therefore maybe used for general purposes....",False

Siem Reap Province - Cambodia    Siem Reap is a beautiful idyllic tourist town just a stone's throw away from the spectacular Angkor Wat Archeological Park in Cambodia.    ""If you have ever been to Siem Reap  or Cambodia in general  you will know how warm  friendly  kind and compassionate the Khmer people are"".    Since the lockdown began  hardly any tourists are visiting the city  with visitor numbers to the Angkor world heritage site down by 99.5%  only 650 people visited the Temple in the month of April  that's 20 people per day compared to around 5 000 back in January.    This situation has created a major problem in Siem Reap. The average wage in the city for people who worked within or in connection with the tourist industry is around $4 USD per day  that's less than $3.50p for around 10 hours work or 35 pence an hour.    The city is more or less totally deserted with literally no visitors  there is no money being spent  no income….nothing…zero. As you can imagine  if you were only earning $4 a day ""in normal circumstances""  then you can probably understand why many families really don’t have any ability to save money to help themselves get through the times when the going gets tough…really tough.     There are many reports of people hearing children crying themselves to sleep at night through hunger.     Many families are trying to live off the land by foraging for fruit and vegetables  frogs  snakes and Rats etc  but the basic essentials that we all take for granted in the UK such as Rice  Eggs  Cooking Oil  Salt and Sugar are products that thousands of families in Siem Reap simply can no longer afford.     Real Hunger exists  in Siem Reap Province  because a large number of families  living at or below the poverty line  do not have enough money to consistently put food on the table.    Job losses  due to Covid 19  have pushed the total number of hungry families to an estimated 20 000. That means as many as 80 000 souls in the Province  are going bed hungry tonight without knowing where there next meal will come from.    Why the Siem Reap Food Bank?    Having lived and experienced an amazing life in South East Asia for over 18 years  I wanted to contribute in a meaningful way  to help some of the most vulnerable people through the ongoing Covid 19 crisis.    After many discussions with my wonderful friend  Christopher Leonard who is currently living there and witnessing first-hand the stone cold reality of the situation  we decided together to spend considerable time researching and validating food giveaway programs currently operating in Siem Reap.    Christopher  spent quality time with Naret and Rick and we could both see that with more money  international awareness and resources  The Siem Reap Food Bank could reach out to so many more families in desperate need of support.    The Siem Reap Food Bank continues to make a real sustainable difference to people in risk of extreme poverty and hunger.     So I decided to volunteer my time to support this incredibly important project and I wanted to share with you why I have chosen this specific Food Bank.    The Siem Reap Food Bank initially launched in April to provide Essential Care Food Packages to people living with disabilities to help them survive the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.     The Siem Reap Food Bank support families headed by or including people with a disability  that have seen their livelihoods disappear  along with the tourists and shops  restaurants  hotels and businesses being shut down.    With the situation continuing to get worse it soon became clear that the Siem Reap Food Bank would not just need to support families with disabilities through this unprecedented time  but any families identified to be in urgent need of an Essential Care Food Package to help them survive.    How Your Kind Donation Helps These Families:    Below is one example of a family the Siem Reap Food Bank is helping every month with a £26 Essential Care Food Package:    Mai Lin  a single mom of 4 children  all under the age of 12  suffered a paralysing stroke about 5 years ago. At the time  she was overwrought with fear that she would no longer be able to take care of her babies.     However  she learned how to make shopping bags from old newspapers and the income generated was sufficient for her to support her family and was even enough to send her children to school. Mai Lin’s income dried up completely with the closure of the Genevieve’s Fair Trade Village shop that sold her products  at the onset of the CoVid19 shutdown.     Along with her first food drop  just before Khmer New Year (April 13th 2020)  came the promise of monthly food drops until she is able to get back to making a living for herself to ensure her family survives.      What's Contained in a Monthly Essential Care Food Package:      We only need 1 000 people from across world to donate as little as as £10 pounds (less than then the price of a few takeout coffees) to succeed in reaching our campaign goal to support 100 families.    Please  help us meet our funding goal by making any donation you can afford.     We know that this is very tough time for many  so if you are unable to donate funds can please help us by sharing this appeal in any way you can via ( social media  friends and family as well as any networks you have connections with) help us create awareness and momentum for this ongoing humanitarian crisis.    On behalf of the families you are helping  thank you for your kindness  you really are making a life changing difference.    Myself and Christopher are volunteering for the Siem Reap Food Bank  with Christopher managing the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event and I'm helping to create awareness for the gofundme campaign.

I solemnly pledge that 100% of all funds raised through this campaign site are automatically transferred to my UK Bank account and then transferred directly into the Siem Reap Food bank ABA bank account in Cambodia.     HOW DONATIONS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED    Our goal is to make sure the Siem Reap Food bank has continuous cash flow to purchase food & other essential items throughout the coming months  therefore monies will be transferred to their bank account on a regular basis.     The Siem Reap Food Bank Use of Funds: To purchase and distribute essential food and health items for families in need of food support living throughout the Siem Reap province.    Essential costs: To pay for the products being purchased and supplied  plus a few dollars for delivery.

"Commuters Funding for Covid-19","London, Greater London, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/commuter-funding-for-covid19,4800,5000,,2020-03-21,"NATIONAL EMERGENCIES TRUST","Registered nonprofitDonations eligible for Gift Aid.",0,,"For a large number of professionals  who are fortunate enough to work from home - and whose jobs aren't impacted by the crisis - we are left feeling powerless to help in the fight against Covid-19.     With the resounding government message that the biggest support we can give NHS is social distancing  we're hearing from a lot of our friends and colleagues that they feel unable to make a difference in a meaningful way during this unprecedented global and national crisis.     In day four of our self quarantine (and with a lot of time on our hands!)  we've come up with an idea.     i. How can commuters help?     In total  most professionals working from home are likely to make inadvertent economies  for example in London commuters will no longer be paying:    - The daily TfL capped tube fare is £10.40  - A daily coffee will set you back £2.50 (on average)    If we were to invest the savings we weren't expecting to have (or even a portion of it) to a charity  we could all make a huge difference to those on the frontline in hospitals and in the charity sectors (e.g. managing food bank shortages)  with funds being made quickly available to those who are in critical need.     ii. Why support the National Emergencies Trust?    On Wednesday 18 March  Prince William launched a Coronavirus fundraising appeal as part of the National Emergencies Trust. It is working collaboratively with a wide range of organisations to ensure the maximum amount of money is raised and distributed securely  effectively  and fairly to those organisations and local charities who can do most to help those in need.     Through a partnership network established over the past few months  the funds raised will only be channelled through the most trusted and reputable organisations  so you know you’re giving to those who need it the most.    iii. Next steps     Calculate your daily/weekly work-from-home savings and make a donation here of an appropriate amount  which will be directed to The National Emergencies Trust.     We've set a target of £5 000 but let's aim BIG!     Thank you for your time and contribution!",False

"72 Hour Fast To Feed The Hungry","Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom",https://uk.gofundme.com/f/72-hour-fast-to-feed-the-hungry,285,500,,2020-10-25,,,0,,"Hello! A few days ago  321 MPs in the UK voted to allow children to go hungry during the coronavirus pandemic which has already increased strain on UK food banks. This time of year is already usually difficult as families need to choose between keeping the heating on or feeding their children. It's truly a dystopian hellscape we are living through  but you can help. I saw a tweet from a teacher who said ""I hope you never have to hear an 11 y/o ask “miss can I share your snacks?” On a Monday morning bc they haven’t ate since Friday lunch. I hope you never have to watch a GCSE student breakdown about not doing their revision bc they were worrying about how to feed their siblings."" And my heart broke.     No child should ever have to wait 72 hours between meals  because that's the length of time between Friday lunch time and Monday lunch time. And that is why I will be fasting between 3pm Friday 27th November and Monday 30th November  and raising money for Drumchapel food bank. Please consider donating either through this link or directly to the charity. You can donate non perishable food items  sanitary items or even cash to help them bulk out the weekly parcels with things they are low on! If the Government won't step in  we can. Thank you!
