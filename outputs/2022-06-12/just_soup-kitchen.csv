The rest of the journey will be organised as I go along. My aim is to be in Jerusalem by the end of November and back home in the UK for Christmas (I’ve promised my family). That’s roughly 10,000&nbsp; kilometres in just over three months. I’ve avoided a detailed plan in preference for spontaneity but the headlines are I will be travelling out through France, Italy, Greece and Turkey, and returning via the Balkans, then central and Western Europe. Unfortunately I will be forced to fly to Israel from Turkey as the land route either through Libya or Syria is too dangerous at the moment.</p><p>I will be generally sleeping in the back of the car, with<br>seats removed.&nbsp;<span> </span>I use my mum’s old 1970 sofa cushion for a bed, and it serves the purpose well. Other than a map, a washing up bowl, a kettle, basic car repair kit and half a dozen changes of clothing that’s it. I’m doing everything on the ultra-cheap.</p><p><b>Why-</b>&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly it’s for myself. I don’t feel right unless I take on a few big trips a year especially now that I’m retired. But it’s also to raise money for my favourite charity 'Become' (<a href=""http://www.becomecharity.org.uk/"">http://www.becomecharity.org.uk/</a>),which is the leading charity helping young people coming out of the care system and starting adult life. In my career as a psychiatric nurse I encountered many people for whom this transition had gone badly wrong. This is common. 'Become' works with care leavers to help them establish a firm footing, as they take their first steps toward independent living</p><p><b>What equips me for<br>this?</b> -</p><p>&nbsp;I am a sixty year old overweight, rheumatic retired psychiatric nurse with a lifelong love of independent travel using local transport, walking, hitch hiking or driving ordinary vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p>There has been scores of these trips but just taking the best this hobby has taken me on over 10,000 miles worth of trips by motorhome around the USA. More recently I have travelled by long distance bus and ferry boat around Argentina (including Northern Patagonia) and the nearer parts of Uruguay.&nbsp;</p><p>I spent a month travelling around India by train using second class carriages, that is those used by the poorest local people. Despite a general lack of fitness I’ve walked the first hundred miles of the Via Egnatia, a rough country track which follows a Roman road across Albania. Each spring for the last five years I have walked 100-200 miles&nbsp; on the ancient pilgrimage route, the Camino Sangtiago de Compestela that runs from France to Galicia in North-Western Spain.&nbsp;</p><p>During the 1980’s and early 1990’s I lived In South Africa and travelled extensively in neighbouring countries (Lesotho, Swaziland, Zambia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe). </p><p>I enjoy this kind of thing, and have been doing it<br>since I was a teenager. I do my best to be around local people, talk to strangers and find out how they live. I stay well clear of any tourist hubs and instead hop between smaller towns and immerse myself in local life for a few days. I’m the resilient type and tend to find a way of getting through or past obstacles.</p><p>On this trip I will be posting a daily blog and Facebook updates where ever possible. Sponsors will be able to follow my journey through these.</p><p>I have been very fortunate in my life but I've known many people who grew up in care, and then failed to find the help and support they needed when the time came to leave. Often they were ill equipped to cope alone and went on to have serious mental health or drug and alcohol problems. The charity 'Become' is all about helping such people with this transition. I've supported them for a number of years through personal donations , and have seen the quality of help they provide. Its really all about improving the life opportunities of people for whom things can...and&nbsp; often go badly wrong&nbsp; That's why I have chosen to undertake this trip to benefit 'Become'.</p><p>All the costs of travel are being met by myself and a separate network of sponsors. No money raised for 'Become' will come to me.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Households that are ‘food insecure’ mean that they cannot guarantee sufficient quality or quantity of food.<br><br>Our efforts will be directed to support Kitchen Social, a leading holiday food provision programme in this space. <br><br>Founded by an independent charity, the Mayor’s Fund for London, Kitchen Social gives children and young people a safe place to socialise, learn and get a free, healthy meal. The programme helps to alleviate the financial strain on families that comes with accessing food and childcare activities during the school holidays. Long school breaks, without the support that young people need to thrive, is one of the drivers of educational attainment gaps between young people from different socio-economic backgrounds. Food insecurity over the school holidays can lead to learning loss, lower self-esteem, and weight gain. Poor nutrition and social isolation not only affect a child’s wellbeing but also impacts physical and mental development, thereby perpetuating the cycle of poverty.<br><br>Kitchen Social has a city-wide network of over 100 local community organisations including schools, adventure playgrounds, and youth clubs that provide nutritious food and fun activities. In response to the pandemic, Kitchen Social also created ""Take and Make"" – a recipe box series designed to engage children at home with their families. These boxes contain ingredients for four portions of nutritious food, alongside recipe cards and online video tutorials.<br><br><br><b>What we'll deliver:</b><br><br>&nbsp;・Raise funds for Kitchen Social’s Take and Make boxes so they can be distributed to young people during the Christmas break, providing opportunities for children to learn new skills and cook together with their parents</p><p><span>・Contribute to Kitchen Social’s Christmas Grant Activities where families can attend a Christmas party in their local area, access food, and take part in entertaining activities</span></p><p><br><b>Why it's a great idea:</b><br><br>Covid-19 has caused the number of families living in food insecurity to rise. A recent Mayor’s Fund for London survey revealed that 75% of families reported having less money for food. Many do not qualify for government support.  <br><br>Kitchen Social is stepping up to support more local community organisations during school holidays. Take and Make boxes help to ease the pressure that some parents feel outside of term-time. It is a fantastic way to support a child's wellbeing and encourage young people into the kitchen to learn about ingredients, try new skills and cook nutritious food with families and friends. <br><br>We will be running an online cooking class to fundraise for this project. Engaging with two nutrition-based TikTokers and a chef who will be doing a live cook along. These activities aim to: <br><br>・Contribute towards Christmas holiday funding, providing young people with activities, social engagement, and a delicious meal during the Christmas break</p><p>・Fund ingredients for Take and Make boxes</p><p>・<span>Provide children at risk of food insecurity with Take and Make boxes</span></p><p>More information about our online cooking class is available at the link below!!!:</p><p>https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/online-cooking-class-with-nigel-thompson-teawithmrt-tickets-165170827391?keep_tld=1<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",12,12,"2021-08-08 5/2021-08-08 10/2021-08-02 5/2021-08-02 30/2021-08-01 30/2021-07-31 4/2021-07-31 25/2021-07-31 20/2021-07-31 5/2021-07-31 20/2021-07-31 20",https://www.justgiving.com/mayorsfundxbath,2021-08-10,300,300,"Online Cooking Class"

A warm welcome awaits people who wish to socialise, find support and enjoy a hot meal.</p>",193,194,"2020-10-29 10/2020-03-29 36/2019-12-05 200/2019-12-03 40/2019-12-01 200/2019-11-26 20/2019-11-23 20/2019-11-22 50/2019-11-22 20/2019-11-22 50/2019-11-22 15/2019-11-22 50/2019-11-21 20/2019-11-21 20/2019-11-21 10/2019-11-21 10/2019-11-21 5/2019-11-21 10/2019-11-21 20/2019-11-21 14/2019-11-21 30/2019-11-21 5/2019-11-21 20/2019-11-21 20/2019-11-21 200/2019-11-20 20/2019-11-20 30/2019-11-20 10/2019-11-20 20/2019-11-20 15/2019-11-19 30/2019-11-19 10/2019-11-19 30/2019-11-18 10/2019-11-18 20/2019-11-18 50/2019-11-18 20/2019-11-18 10/2019-11-18 20/2019-11-18 10/2019-11-18 100/2019-11-17 36/2019-11-16 50/2019-11-16 20/2019-11-16 100/2019-11-16 50/2019-11-16 5/2019-11-16 20/2019-11-16 30/2019-11-16 10/2019-11-16 77/2019-11-12 20/2019-11-12 10/2019-11-12 20/2019-11-11 20/2019-11-11 50/2019-11-10 10/2019-11-10 40/2019-11-10 10/2019-11-10 20/2019-11-09 30/2019-11-09 15/2019-11-09 20/2019-11-08 20/2019-11-07 30/2019-11-07 10/2019-11-07 30/2019-11-07 30/2019-11-07 10/2019-11-06 30/2019-11-06 20/2019-11-06 50/2019-11-06 20/2019-11-06 10/2019-11-06 10/2019-11-05 20/2019-11-05 20/2019-11-05 20/2019-11-05 20/2019-11-05 20/2019-11-04 10/2019-11-04 5/2019-11-03 30/2019-11-03 5/2019-11-03 30/2019-11-03 10/2019-11-03 20/2019-11-03 10/2019-11-03 10/2019-11-03 20/2019-11-02 10/2019-11-02 20/2019-11-02 100/2019-11-02 125/2019-11-02 20/2019-11-02 20/2019-11-02 50/2019-11-02 10/2019-11-02 10/2019-11-02 10/2019-11-01 25/2019-11-01 30/2019-11-01 50/2019-11-01 5/2019-11-01 20/2019-11-01 30/2019-11-01 10/2019-11-01 30/2019-11-01 10/2019-11-01 50/2019-11-01 20/2019-11-01 10/2019-10-31 10/2019-10-31 100/2019-10-31 20/2019-10-31 25/2019-10-31 10/2019-10-31 20/2019-10-31 30/2019-10-31 30/2019-10-31 30/2019-10-31 50/2019-10-31 30/2019-10-31 20/2019-10-31 50/2019-10-31 10/2019-10-31 10/2019-10-31 10/2019-10-31 30/2019-10-31 10/2019-10-31 10/2019-10-31 10/2019-10-31 100/2019-10-31 30/2019-10-31 30/2019-10-30 50/2019-10-30 10/2019-10-30 30/2019-10-30 10/2019-10-30 30/2019-10-30 15/2019-10-30 10/2019-10-30 10/2019-10-30 10/2019-10-30 10/2019-10-30 20/2019-10-30 20/2019-10-30 10/2019-10-30 20/2019-10-30 30/2019-10-30 10/2019-10-30 10/2019-10-30 20/2019-10-30 30",https://www.justgiving.com/thomas-tunney,2020-10-29,5176,2000,"Tom's Bin the Beard for the Soup Kitchen"

Firstly, let me say thank you for the outpouring of support we've received. It's always a heart-warming feeling to know that we have so many incredible supporters. 

Last week, in light of the Coronavirus, we made the difficult decision to offer a takeaway-only food service to guests rather than their usual sit-down meal. As most of you know, we take a huge amount of pride in the fact that we offer not just a warm meal to our guests, but also a safe and warm space off the streets for them for the hours they're with us. As we considered the health risks we decided that it would be prudent to only offer a takeaway food service for the foreseeable future.

As you all know I have been a regular visitor to the centre. Starting my journey with Cancer back in 2014 when Maggies Manchester was,nt there. Opening of the new center brought such hope and strength to myself and my family along with making new friends, a fabulous place, warm and welcoming. Fundraising has been a challenge this year with Covid so our Kitchen table day is a little different. Not able to create gatherings as usual around the table laden with cakes and treats, to help Maggies. I am asking for a small donation to help Maggies through this very hard time. The work they do is so brilliant. Let's get this going. Thankyou all so much for supporting me with my fundraiser.

Rough sleepers need additional support to self-isolate and protect themselves from Covid-19.  Providing someone with a place to stay, a meal to eat and someone to talk to, are invaluable in supporting struggling individuals find their feet again during times of a global pandemic or otherwise.</p><p><br>Christmas time can be the most difficult for homeless people, both <br>because of the cold weather that makes sleeping rough even more <br>dangerous and because of being without family at Christmas. Unfortunately Covid-19 pandemic has only increased this. There are <br>many factors that can lead to homelessness and it is often the most <br>vulnerable people in our community that are affected. <br><br>To watch the video click the link<a href=""https://herringbonekitchens.com/herringbone-and-catching-lives-christmas-donations"" target=""_blank""> Together We Can</a></p><p></p><p>According to <a href=""https://www.catchinglives.org/"">Catching Lives</a>, a homelessness charity aimed at supporting rough sleepers, homeless and vulnerably housed in Canterbury and East Kent, there is even less support available than previous years due to funding cuts by the government. Homelessness rose by a record 22% last year, with 726 deaths in 2018 and expected increase this winter.&nbsp; For the people that Catching Lives supports, it can be a long journey to getting back on their feet and recovering from the trauma of rough sleeping. Providing someone with a place to stay, a meal to eat and people to talk to, simple things that most of us take for granted, are invaluable first steps to getting the support they need.</p><p>At <a href=""https://www.herringbonekitchens.com"" target=""_blank"">Herringbone Kitchens</a> we know how fortunate we all are to have warm homes. As a company we have supported Catching Lives, for the past 7 years through donations and by giving our time cooking meals for the homeless. A service particuarly close to our hearts is the Catching Lives Night Shelter, which provides 2400 bed spaces over December through to March for people in need.&nbsp;The charity also offers basic meals, showers, laundry and storage facilities.</p><p>This year we want to help Catching Lives show the real face of homelessness and to help raise money for the Winter Night Shelter. To encourage businesses and people about the small things we can all do to make a difference, we  worked together with Catching Lives to produce a Christmas tale - “Together We Can”. This video is a spin on the popular Christmas Ad’s often ran by large department stores this time of year and has set a goal to help raise £15k to keep the Winter Shelter open.   </p><p>There were no actors used in the video, the family in the film are Lydia and Rob Merry,  clients of Herringbone Kitchens and the homeless man is James Duff, who was previously homeless and now is a Trustee of Catching Lives. <a href=""http://redcapeproductions.co.uk/"">Red Cape Productions</a> made and produced the film and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/maxinescottt/"" target=""_blank"">Maxine Scott</a> produced and recorded the single ‘Together We Can.’ The filming was shot across Canterbury and at the Winter Night Shelter at Catching Lives. </p><p>Together there are easy ways to help support the homeless, through giving time or money.

,,,SC024414,"Maggie's Centres",False,2022-03-18,"<p>When Des was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer it was a very difficult time for all the family. We were in the middle of a pandemic, living in lockdown and isolating from friends and family. To be told your cancer is non curative and you only have between 6 and 12 months to live was completely devastating.</p><p>We were told to visit the Maggie’s centre near the Christie and we were so glad we did. It is truly a place of calm, a safe haven in the midst of all the trauma.</p><p>Des found his diagnosis very difficult to accept. Fortunately he was able to have regular sessions with the Centre’s Psychologist Robin Muir. These chats proved to be invaluable.</p><p>Also during this time Laurie and I took part in the friends and family support group online. I actually came to look forward to these Tuesday sessions where people could share their experiences and talk about their fears and worries. It was always good to hear when someone had a clear scan!</p><p>While Des was having his treatments I could sit and read in the centre, enjoy the garden, talk to one of the support team, cry and have a cup of tea. Nothing was too much trouble. The emotional support provided was a life line and gave me the strength to keep going.</p><p>Sadly Des’s battle with cancer only lasted 7 months, but Maggie’s are still there supporting us as a family. We have taken part in the bereavement groups and continue to meet up regularly. It makes a difference talking to people who have been through the same ordeal.</p><p>Maggie’s is completely funded by donations. Having a &nbsp;‘kitchen table couple of hours’ is the least we can do to support them.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",59,59,"2022-04-05 20/2022-04-04 40/2022-04-01 30/2022-03-30 20/2022-03-29 30/2022-03-27 30/2022-03-27 30/2022-03-26 20/2022-03-25 10/2022-03-25 50/2022-03-25 30/2022-03-25 20/2022-03-25 20/2022-03-25 40/2022-03-25 5/2022-03-25 5/2022-03-25 12/2022-03-25 20/2022-03-25 40/2022-03-25 30/2022-03-25 30/2022-03-25 30/2022-03-25 10/2022-03-25 30/2022-03-25 50/2022-03-25 30/2022-03-25 20/2022-03-25 20/2022-03-25 10/2022-03-25 40/2022-03-25 10/2022-03-25 30/2022-03-25 30/2022-03-25 30/2022-03-25 20/2022-03-24 20/2022-03-24 10/2022-03-24 50/2022-03-24 10/2022-03-24 30/2022-03-24 30/2022-03-24 20/2022-03-23 20/2022-03-23 30/2022-03-23 20/2022-03-22 10/2022-03-22 50/2022-03-21 10/2022-03-21 30/2022-03-20 5/2022-03-20 100/2022-03-20 30/2022-03-20 20/2022-03-20 25/2022-03-19 30/2022-03-19 30/2022-03-18 10",https://www.justgiving.com/kitchentableday-a1041,2022-04-05,1735,500,"Maggie's Kitchen Table Day"

If you would like to contribute a recipe, you must be a music professional, it must be your own recipe, free from copyright issues, and be accompanied by a description of why this recipe is special, why it’s your favourite, what it means to you. The personal story is as important as the recipe. For those who don’t like to cook (mentioning no names!), there’ll be a section of easy recipes which are useful when we’re touring. There will be vegan/gluten/dairy-free/Keto recipes in there so everyone has something to try. Not all recipes will make the book, but I will create a digital resource where you can subscribe and access all of the submitted recipes. Your donation to this very worthy charity, which is looking after musicians in crisis, is hugely appreciated. Every penny will go to where ur is needed most. Food is love.

,,,1186569,"NHS Charities Together",False,2020-04-16,"<p><span>Hi everyone!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Just a little page I’ve set up here as I know, like many people, I’ve felt a little bit helpless and wanting to support more during this strange time we're all living in. There’s not one of us who won’t be effected in some way by what’s going on and I know we are hearing a lot about the devastation, but there are many positives popping up too with people coming together (virtually), raising money, and the general recognition for the incredible key workers and those on the frontline (NHS, Armed Forces, Carers, Food suppliers and Supermarket workers, Hospital cleaners, Police, Teachers, etc).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>The brilliant 5k challenge got me wondering if there’s something similar but from home, especially for anyone unable to run or get outside right now. I so far haven’t found a page where you cook/bake, post, nominate, and DONATE some money for EACH INGREDIENT used in your masterpiece…so this is what I’m starting here! I’ve seen so many fab chefs and bakers come out of the woodworks during this period - so why not help and donate a little something whilst you’re at it (it may be something you're making for yourself or others, and can also be a therapeutic way to manage any anxieties this may all be bringing).</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>I’ve baked/made a load of things mainly with ingredients we already had since the lockdown began and have now donated £1 for every ingredient used. Just ONE bake or dish (it doesn’t have to be cake or anything overly fancy - unless you want it to be! Anything sweet or savoury, baked or cooked) could make a difference (even those ‘3 ingredient recipes’ will still be something) and they can be healthy too (although this isn’t a requirement...😉). We all know some essentials are a little scarce right now so consider it a challenge to get creative too!</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>This can include something you’ve made during this period already, just:</span></p><p><span>- Share a picture of it</span><span>&nbsp;on your Instagram or Facebook (if you don’t have access to these, send to someone who can share it for you)</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>- Add #pitchinfromthekitchen<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>- Nominate however many people<span>&nbsp;you’d like for them to give it a go too (although you DON’T need to wait to be nominated as you can start your own chain!)</span></span></p><p><span>- And DONATE £1 for EACH ingredient used in that recipe.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There are tonnes of completely worthy charities this could go to. A key one is of course ‘NHS Charities Together’ who I donated half to; the other half I donated to Trussell Trust (supporting food banks). As you can only select one charity through Just Giving, ALL donations through this page’s link will go directly to ‘NHS Charities Together.’ In addition to the sheer importance of the NHS to me (and all of us), I’ve chosen this one having read about the invaluable support these funds could offer to the incredible NHS volunteers, frontline staff, isolated patients and their families right now, which I’m hoping will last a long time even after this has passed. I've also heard first hand accounts from those I know who are working at all costs on the frontline; so this is my very small way of saying a very big thank you.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Here’s to a target of £200 to start with and&nbsp;</span><span>ki</span><span>cking it off by nominating people who I know love to bake or cook!</span><span>&nbsp;Enjoy, and stay safe! x&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span></span></p><p>NB: Any donations have been processed once you receive the ‘donation complete or thank you ✅’ message, but this can take a few hours to show up on the fundraising page. <br></p><p>Instagram: pitch_in_from_the_kitchen&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook: Pitch in from the kitchen&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>- - - - - -&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Hey everyone!<span>&nbsp;</span>In order to raise money for the NHS and show gratitude and respect to the heroes working tirelessly on the front line, I have decided to start a fun challenge! Here’s the plan: you create a dish in your kitchen; this can be anything you like!

Create your dish, donate £5 using the just-giving link, post a picture on social media with the hashtags #welcometomykitchen and #£5 and tag 5 friends who you nominate to take part next! It’s that simple! Please feel free to jazz up your social media posts; is there a fun story that goes with your dish? A special memory? Or maybe you can include the recipe if you like! Please get involved and share with lots of friends! Thank you!&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

However much you can spare, your donation will help tackle poverty, take action against violence and bring an end to discrimination – in the UK and across the world.

We’re fundraising for Red Nose Day because...

• £5 could pay to get 20 meals to vulnerable children and families in the UK

• £10 could provide 20 reading books for children in community learning centres in Northern Uganda, where free pre-school services are very limited

• £20 could provide a supportive coffee morning for families in the UK to share advice on caring for their child’s mental health

Run by 100 volunteers. More than one third of those who receive support from Kirkcaldy foodbank are children. 8650 food parcels per month are given out from Kirkcaldy foodbank. These figures left me feeling very sad and that I wanted to do something to help.</p><p>I know many of us have our kitchen cupboards packed so full that if we simply cleared away the tins of soup we aren't going to use, the pasta packets that we have 4 of along with the excess boxes of cereal we have never looked at. That we together could help these people and help Kirkcaldy foodbank, even if its a drop in the ocean for them.</p><p>That is why I am asking you all to please donate £5 worth of food from your cupboards, or £5 from your purse/ wallet.</p><p>In return, your name will be entered into our draw to win a kitchen deep clean inc oven clean to the value of £80. Once the draw ends I will pull one name from a hat and that lucky winner will receive this offer. You can enter as many times as you like.

I love our Friday Facebook Live sessions each week and when I accidentally suggested that I should do a 24-hour Kitchen Disco fundraiser, I initially thought - what have I done?! </span><span></span></p><p><span>However, literally seconds after I thought what better way to show my support for all of the fantastic work that SNAP does, than to offer what I love most in the world - music!</span></p><p><span>Music is such a lifeline for me and for so many people, especially over the lockdowns this past year. </span><span>Our online sessions have enabled people to come together through their love and enjoyment of music, so why not offer this for 24 hours!!</span></p><p><span>I will be holding our Kitchen Disco live from The SNAP Centre along with the wonderful Karen and Dale from 9:30am on Friday 5th March, all the way through to 9:30am on Saturday 6th March, singing and playing requests from people who are able to support and join us on the SNAP Facebook page. I will also have some fun musical games, as well as some special friends who will pop by to sing or play us a song to keep us going! </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>A 24-hour Kitchen Disco is going to be hard, so if you are able to sponsor us in advance or donate on the day we would really appreciate it. Join us on the SNAP Facebook page as well to give us some words of encouragement - we're going to need it!!!""</span></p><p><font color=""#000000"">This really is an incredible challenge and we can not wait to watch it live on SNAP's Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/SnapCharity&nbsp;</font></p><p>Every donation is hugely appreciated and will go a long way towards helping SNAP continue to be here for Essex families who have a child or young person with any special need or disability.

I might only be little but I wanted to do my bit to support a great charity who have helped me and my family a lot. As some of you may know, I was born with a cleft palate and got my new mouth in March of this year. I am really enjoying staying at home with my Mummy and Daddy and have recently taken up walking (with the help of some new wheels). My plan is that each day, I will complete 26 laps of the kitchen island. I will do this for 26 days. I will take requests for songs to do my walking to, and Mummy and Daddy will share some clips of my efforts on here (first one available to view now: Mummy picked the song to get us started. See&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/X_LyLxVUdkE"">https://youtu.be/X_LyLxVUdkE</a><span>).</span></p><p>My Mummy wanted you to know that this fantastic charity are in real danger of collapse due to the pandemic. CLAPA works with our local cleft team to provide feeding equipment, support, as well as being the national voice for the progression of cleft care. And we want to do our bit to help.</p><p>Mummy also wanted me to let you know that she is cooking 26 new recipes for me to eat and will share progress for anyone that is interested. She hasn't set a time limit for this as she thinks she's got enough on, what with the lockdown and everything.</p><p>We know it's a difficult time, but if you are able to support our event, we would really appreciate it, and know this fantastic charity would too.</p><p>With much love,</p><p>Myles Arthur Kelly xxxx</p><p>(almost nine months)</p><p>#twopointsixchallenge #CLAPA #1in700 #Mylesaroundthekitchen</p><p>Video clips:</p><p>Day 1: I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) - The Proclaimers&nbsp;</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/X_LyLxVUdkE"">https://youtu.be/X_LyLxVUdkE</a><br></p><p>Day 2: Walk This Way - Run-D.M.C</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/v3FiAjamdBc"">https://youtu.be/v3FiAjamdBc</a><br></p><p>Day 3:Walk of Life - Dire Straits</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/2qMqgXa3GwY"">https://youtu.be/2qMqgXa3GwY</a><br></p><p>Day 4:Run to You - Bryan Adams</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/St2fCxlKqfE"">https://youtu.be/St2fCxlKqfE</a><br></p><p>Day 5:These Boots Are Made For Walking - Nancy Sinatra</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/1qjjdRMpsLw"">https://youtu.be/1qjjdRMpsLw</a><br></p><p>Day 6:Walk Like An Egyptian - The Bangles (featuring Mummy &amp; Daddy)</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/0cLeP5E6DPk"">https://youtu.be/0cLeP5E6DPk</a><br></p><p>Day 7: You'll Never Walk Alone - Gerry and the Pacemakers</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/-43E7Eu4-zE"">https://youtu.be/-43E7Eu4-zE</a></p><p>Day 8: Walking on Sunshine - Katrina &amp; the Waves</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/nMVOElHAzpM"">https://youtu.be/nMVOElHAzpM</a><br></p><p>Day 9:1000 miles - Vanessa Carlton</p><div><div><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/1F8GIfGHjys"">https://youtu.be/1F8GIfGHjys</a></div><p><span>Day 10: Dance Monkey &nbsp;- Tones &amp; I</span><br></p></div><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/2Hq8WgUE6vE"">https://youtu.be/2Hq8WgUE6vE</a><br></p><p>Day 11:Walkin Back to happiness - Helen Shaprio&nbsp;</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/oqcbrhw19lc"">https://youtu.be/oqcbrhw19lc</a><br></p><p>Day 12:All about you - McFly</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/29PEWI7KNPs"">https://youtu.be/29PEWI7KNPs</a><br></p><p>Day 13:Walking in the Rain - David Cassidy</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/HDmJ7MWzksI"">https://youtu.be/HDmJ7MWzksI</a><br></p><p>Day 14: Headlong - Queen</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/u8i9Ngn67Bo"">https://youtu.be/u8i9Ngn67Bo</a><br></p><p>Day 15: Traveller - Chris Stapleton</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/esLH2xBST90"">https://youtu.be/esLH2xBST90</a><br></p><p>Day 16: Walkin' Miracle - Limmie &amp; Family Cookin'</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/-P5tYi_1ykI"">https://youtu.be/-P5tYi_1ykI</a><br></p><p>Day 17: Ain't No Mountain High Enough - Marvin Gaye</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/5uWbwfK2ZBU"">https://youtu.be/5uWbwfK2ZBU</a><br></p><p>Day 18: Walk Like A Man - Frankie Valley</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/op8OJVL4wmU"">https://youtu.be/op8OJVL4wmU</a><br></p><p>Day 19:Walking Away - Craig David</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/hAFoWLBjv6A"">https://youtu.be/hAFoWLBjv6</a>A<br></p><p>Day 20:Here come the sun - The Beatles</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/_ezIZf0UyJU"">https://youtu.be/_ezIZf0UyJU</a><br></p><p>Day 21:Round Round - Sugarbabies</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/3T85n500vPs"">https://youtu.be/3T85n500vPs</a><br></p><p>Day 22: Walking on Broken Glass (Not really) - Annie Lennox</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/rZrj1eXgcZ0"">https://youtu.be/rZrj1eXgcZ0</a><br></p><p>Day 23: One Step Beyond - Madness</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/4UTnIFgWjmY"">https://youtu.be/4UTnIFgWjmY</a><br></p><p>Day 24: Summer Holiday - Sir Cliff Richard</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/f5BRHavKkTQ"">https://youtu.be/f5BRHavKkTQ</a><br></p><p>Day 25: Wrapped Up - Olly Murs</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/15t__TPfN3w"">https://youtu.be/15t__TPfN3w</a><br></p><p>Day 26! : Don't Stop Me Now - Queen</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/LCH2t6WB74s"">https://youtu.be/LCH2t6WB74s</a><br></p><div><span>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</span></div><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

,,,801343,Beat,False,2022-01-30,"<p>I’m walking the Ingleborough with my friends to raise awareness for eating disorders and get GP’s better training in the field of diagnosing and treating Ed sufferers!</p><p>&nbsp;One of the saving graces for my mental health is getting out in nature with my friends. One of our favourite things to do is what we call our ‘soup and a sunset’ dates where we make a new soup recipe and go on a walk onto watch the sunset. This challenge means a lot to me because my eating disorder took memories like these with friends away from me for a long time. I didn’t allow myself to eat with friends and saw exercise solely as a gruelling workout that wasn’t meant to be enjoyed. Recovery has allowed me to cherish these moments with friends, enjoy moving my body and not feeling guilty about eating bread … I curse my eating disorder for letting me believe that bread is the devil. A warm crusty roll dipped in homemade soup, in a field watching the sunset with friends will solve EVERYTHING. I meant it.&nbsp;</p><p>I've struggled with an eating disorder for over ten years, and still, one of the scariest parts of the illness is speaking about it. But, there is no recovery without talking. I carried a lot of shame for putting my loved ones through the stress that my anorexia caused, because of this I felt guilty speaking to them when I began to struggle again. I felt like I'd let them down. But, the first conversation, just like the first mouthful, is always the hardest, (albeit never as bad as I think it will be.) Active recovery is an everyday battle, one that I have to gently nudge myself on every day. If there's one thing that makes it easier, that's not being ashamed to ask for help. I've lost years, memories and friends to this illness. Your funds can help to make the treatment for eating disorders more accessible and treatable for those suffering.</p><p><span>I've been turned away from, treated badly and belittled by many GP's. I was refused help until I was hours away from death - if my eating disorder was treated earlier then my recovery could've been quicker and I could've stayed at home for treatment. Early treatment saves lives but in a survey of 1,700 people of those who'd asked for help, 72% had waited for more than six months to do so.</span></p><p><span>I want to live in a world where I could go to a GP and be taken as seriously as someone with a broken leg instead of being told to 'eat more.' It needs to change and we can do this by raising money to train GP's adequately.&nbsp; The average GP only gets&nbsp; 2hours of training dedicated to eating disorders throughout their entire medical degree and a fifth of UK medical schools don't give training at all. 67% of respondents felt that some of the early warning signs were missed. If GP's know what to look for, they can ask important questions and refer people for treatment much sooner.</span></p><p><br></p>",14,14,"2022-05-10 5/2022-05-10 5/2022-05-10 5/2022-03-02 10/2022-03-01 10/2022-03-01 15/2022-03-01 20/2022-02-07 5/2022-02-01 5/2022-02-01 20/2022-02-01 10/2022-02-01 10/2022-01-30 3",https://www.justgiving.com/Natalie-Carmichael1,2022-05-10,128,300,"EDAW 2022"

This will involve myself stand up paddleboarding 10 lochs end to end totaling 150km in 6 days! from the 6th to 11th June 2022 finishing on the shores of Loch Rannoch! The goal is to raise 5K to allow the Larder to support more people in need via the Catalyst Kitchen and to raise awareness of the issue of food poverty in our communities!&nbsp;</p><p><span>With prices rising and the squeeze on peoples budgets this will push more household into various forms of Poverty. According to the scottish government in 2017 19% of the population were experiencing some form of poverty </span>that's<span>&nbsp;1 million people! and this was pre-pandemic. As a first world country this is unacceptable and more needs to be done to find a long term and dignified</span><span>&nbsp;solution to support those </span><span>experiencing</span><span>&nbsp;poverty.</span></p><p>During the pandemic The Larder created the Catalyst Kitchen project in a direct response to the increase to those experiencing food insecurity in West Lothian&nbsp;</p><p><span>The Catalyst Kitchen was designed to disrupt the national answer to food insecurity, an answer which provides no choice, no control and no dignity. This project supports our community through pop-up dining experiences, community 'Cook and Dine' classes and the delivery of quality cooked and chilled meals delivered to doors and community pantries. Catalyst Kitchen has and continues to be described as “a lifeline”, “revolutionary”, “invaluable”, “life-changing”.</span></p><p><span>When the pandemic hit in March 2020 and face-to-face dining experiences were no longer able to be held, Catalyst Kitchen quickly pivoted services to the delivery of freshly cooked, chilled meals; launched 3rd of April 2020.</span></p><p></p><p>Food made by The Larder chefs, and where possible, supported by young people in training is distributed by a team of volunteers on a weekly basis either directly to beneficiaries’ doors or to local pick-up points based in partnership organisations.</p><p>Since launch, The Larder have delivered over 120,000 meals to over 800 beneficiaries.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only does The Larder provide a meal service to those in need but also works to break down isolation with the weekly dining experience serviced by The Larders trainees. The team at the Larder look to address the causes and barriers of beneficiaries may be experiencing through The Larders - Cook and dine classes.</p><p>These classes are free to those who are experiencing food insecurity; meaning limited access to food as a result of personal, financial or health issues.</p><p>The Larder’s talented chefs will coach beneficiaries through preparation, cooking skills, food planning and budgeting whilst making delicious meals from scratch. After the class, Beneficiaries will join their fellow classmates for a sit-down meal cooked with their own hands!</p><p>The Larder chefs will guide beneficiaries through this three-hour class, leaving them with new confidence and skills to take home; along with the recipes they have been cooking!</p><p>The Catalyst Kitchen provides a vital service to the West lothian Community and to help support the and raise and my supporting me you can help to have a impact to those most in need in our community and help to fight and alleviate food poverty.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><br><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Food is a language the crosses all borders.<br><span><br>In the words of our founder Max.....</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>""This group was never about trade in the economic sense. It was always about humanity and it was always about love. And it was also about understanding that music is an *essential* element of our being human. We have every reason to think that communities have been singing, playing, drumming and dancing together for hundreds of thousands of years, with every song and beat binding people together, literally creating and perpetuating harmony across our planet.</p><p>In our modern world, and contrary to all our instincts, we have commodified our artistic output and although we have created great art, high and low, in the process, we have also forgotten that music belongs to us all. If you have ever felt like expressing yourself artistically but stopped because you felt that your art was not worthy, the Viral Jukebox is your home. I mean it.</p><p>More than once since I created this group people have suggested that I could find a way to monetise it. They are missing the point. The currency here is love. Spend freely. Give freely. And remember, if you sang or played it from your heart, you played it right.""<br><br>So this Christmas, with the Pandemic rolling on and weird hybrid lockdown in place, we thought it would be great to raise money, together, for our favourite causes, so choose the one closest to your heart (or follow the person who made a song you like and vote for a cause they love!)<br><br>Happy Christmas Jukeboxers!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br></p>",4,4,"2020-12-25 25/2020-12-19 10/2020-12-18 10/2020-12-11 10",https://www.justgiving.com/ViralJukeboxforRefugees,2020-12-25,52,1007,"Viral Jukebox Christmas Crackers - Christmas Songs for Refugee Kitchen"

Please sponsor us to replace their broken oven and give over 5000 of West London’s most vulnerable people a weekly hot meal each year.

We are lucky enough to have working ovens and we are going to use them to raise these much needed funds at a time of crisis. Each sponsor will receive gift of love heart cookies as a thank you as will the amazing volunteers and the Streetlytes guests.
You can’t feed people without an oven! Any money left over once the oven is up and running will go towards giving them a boost in 2021 when their needs are bigger than ever. This is small fundraiser which will make a huge impact.

This time, I have set up a Just Giving page to help the NHS fight the Coronavirus. </p><p> Not only am I raising money for the NHS fighting COVID-19 but I am raising money for them to help my Grandad (David Kitchener) who has unfortunately contracted the virus last week. With great sadness he passed away on the 6th of may midday. He was an amazing man and my best friend.&nbsp;</p><div><p> If you know me then you know that I am very close to my Grandad and have travelled all over the country with him when he has taken me to my athletics meetings. He has supported me through thick and thin and now it is time to support him in his hour of need. If it wasn't for my Grandad I wouldn't be the man that I am today as he helped shape me and pushed me to be the best that I can through sport and his endless love for his family. My Nan (Jane Kitchener) is at home alone now and it seems unfair but this is how things are now. She is surrounded by people who love her and the support that we have had from the people around us is amazing<span>.</span></p><p><span>My grandad was an amazing man and will be so proud and grateful for all your donations. The NHS did everything they could to help him however after fighting for 6 long and hard weeks his body could no longer take it due to one thing or another.&nbsp;</span></p><p> The NHS have been doing a Fantastic Job all over the country and they need our support to fight this virus. From the Doctors and Nurses to the reception staff they have all had a hand in helping loved ones get back on their feet, no matter the challenge. </p><p> Please donate to this fantastic cause and help the people we love return to the people that they love. </p><p> We will start streaming at 1800hrs on Sunday the 10th of may through to the 11th of may at 1800hrs.</p><p> I will be streaming over on twitch so please feel free to drop by.

<h3>Hadrian’s Wall Path</h3>
<p>When the Roman Empire decided to build a wall to keep the marauding Pictish Scots out of northern England, they likely didn’t consider that their handiwork would one day form the backdrop for one of the country’s finest walks. Spanning 135km from Bowness-on-Solway in Cumbria, to appropriately named Wallsend in Tyne and Wear, this moderately challenging National Trail fuses bracing hiking with the cultural heritage for which the UK is famous. Large sections of the wall remain intact, along with a fine museum at the painstakingly excavated Roman fort of Segedunum</p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>While serving I won Exercise Yorkshire Canter twice in the eighties, covering 100 miles in 24hrs, carrying full kit and Rifle, changed my socks after the first 60 miles whether they needed it or not, when you do something such as this you just keep your body moving, there's plenty of time to rest at the finish point. I Completed an 85 km X Country Ski marathon in 7hrs 01 min and even managed to run the B.F.T. 1 &amp;1/2 mile backwards in under 11 &amp;1/2 mins, I am coming out of retirement to complete this challenge because I want to ""do"" something to Support <span>'The Rifles Charities- Care for Casualties'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to raise as much money as possible because they are commited to:</p>
<p>1. Caring for members of the 'Rifles family', both those serving and their families.</p>
<p>2. Offer enduring support to injured Soldiers and their families.</p>
<p>3.Continue to fundraise to ensure the Soldiers and their families receive the highest quality care as possible.</p>
<p>This is why I need your help in sponsoring me, any donation will help in maintaining the high care and support that <span>'Care for Casualties'</span> currently gives out.</p>
<p><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong></p>
<p>I am going to walk Hadrians wall from Solway Firth in the West to Wallsend in the East, total mileage 84 miles, over undulating ground, unaided, with nil costs, eat on the hoof and complete it in 2 days, oh ! and I will be carrying a <strong>kitchen sink</strong> on my back and hoping to get sponsorship from <strong>B&amp;Q</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have today 9/7/10 had confirmation that B&amp;Q are going to sponsor me and now have the Kitchen sink complete with taps etc. Once I have secured it to my rucksack I will post more photographs wearing the bright orange B&amp;Q apron with my name on it and of course the much sought after Rifles Regimental T Shirt.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Thanks to everyone who has sponsored me so far</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I have 50 Rifles wrist bands to give out to people I meet along the wall &amp; a Rifles pennant to fly off my rucksack.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Fund raising going well, big effort being carried out by B&amp;Q in Stockton to raise as much cash in the store.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Once again big thanks to all of you for your kind donations.</span></strong></p>
