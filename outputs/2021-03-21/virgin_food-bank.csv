0,,"56 Alleyn Road,  London,  SE21 8AH","Norwood and Brixton Foodbank Limited",False,2020-12-15,"  The Norwood and Brixton Foodbank is part of the Trussell Trust network of foodbanks that provide essential food and toiletries to people in crisis. The Foodbank was formed in September 2011 with the support and encouragement of a number of local churches. Having established distribution points in West Norwood, Brixton and Streatham the foodbank regularly feeds 10,000 people in poverty each year. Over 70 tonnes of food is needed to meet the need in our community and your donation will help us towards meeting that goal. **Corona Virus Update: Since the outbreak of Covid-19 we have adapted our parcel distribution model to ensure the safety of our clients and staff. We have developed a delivery service shipping parcels directly from our Streatham warehouse to our client's homes. Despite the huge logistical challenge this presents, and an estimated 400% increase in demand, we have still been able to provide essential food parcels to all those referred to us. Thank you for your continued donations that are making this possible**  ","2021-01-05 10/2020-12-22 10/2020-12-22 20/2020-12-21 30/2020-12-21 10/2020-12-21 100/2020-12-18 10/2020-12-18 10/2020-12-18 30/2020-12-18 20/2020-12-18 15/2020-12-18 15/2020-12-18 15/2020-12-18 15/2020-12-17 15/2020-12-16 10/2020-12-16 10/2020-12-16 15/2020-12-16 30/2020-12-16 40/2020-12-16 20/2020-12-16 30/2020-12-16 20/2020-12-16 10/2020-12-16 15/2020-12-15 50/2020-12-15 15",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=NLambethCouncilHousingDepartment&pageUrl=1,2021-01-05,,,600

EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by three full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.   EFP operates 8 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme. Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances. Each food pack provides at least three meals/per day for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave). In 2019-20, we provided 16,984 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 73% increase on the previous year. We were able to do so by receiving 190,000kg of food from donations. Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps. Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres.  Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.

103,FUNDRAISING,"Fareshare Ltd,Unit 7 Deptford Trading Estate  Blackhorse Road,London  SE8 5HY",FareShare,True,2021-03-15,"FareShare exists because 1 in 8 people in the UK are living in poverty and a quarter of those who regularly go without meals are children. At the same time this poverty co-exists alongside thousands of tonnes of food becoming surplus every day.  FareShare saves good food destined for waste and sends it to charities and community groups who transform it into nutritious meals for vulnerable people. The food we redistribute is fresh, quality and in date surplus from the food industry and the charities we work with can be found across the UK. We are now supporting 10,943 charities, helping to feed 924,325 people every week who would are living in food insecurity.  Last year we redistributed enough food for 46.5 million meals. But it’s about more than meals. The organisations we supply food to, from breakfast clubs for disadvantaged children, to homeless hostels, community cafes and domestic violence refuges, are places that provide life changing support, as well as lunch and dinner.   By making sure good food is not wasted, we turn an environmental problem into a social solution.","2021-03-19 30/2021-03-19 30/2021-03-15 50/2021-03-15 50",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=UnumUKCSR&pageUrl=6,2021-03-19,Essex,"SS11 8SH",160

Due to the staggering increase in client numbers in 2020, we are currently urgently fundraising £240,000 to cover our food purchase costs for the early part of next year – without which, we may need to close. We need your help to contact funding bodies, trusts, foundations, corporates and community organisations who give charitable funds for food purchases. Until March 2021 we have funding from the Big Lottery Fund to cover our non-food expenses, but we find it harder to get grant funds that allow food purchases.

We can't wait until we can do this again, but in the meantime we are relying on virtual fundraising. All our members are volunteers but we need your donations to keep our branch running and our phone lines available. Your support is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year. That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started.  We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK.
