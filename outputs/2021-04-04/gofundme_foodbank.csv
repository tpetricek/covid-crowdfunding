We have had a lot of people offer donations and requesting a fundraiser so we have created this for anyone wanting to help. Any donations leftover will be used to help local foodbanks. We will be making free packed lunches throughout the half term for children. If anyone is struggling to make ends meet  please drop us a message (will be strictly confidential) and we will provide a pack up for your children starting from the 27th of October through the half term. We will ensure we are in full PPE whilst making pack ups for hygiene reasons and to avoid risk of contamination  and can arrange delivery/collection.     We understand times are hard at the moment and we want to do our bit to support families and children  please do not hesitate to message us. This is entirely self funded so if anyone would like to donate that would be amazing. Please share and spread the word!!!!!    #nochildgoeshungry #endchildfoodpoverty    Please note we both are trainee primary school teachers and both have a DBS and will also always abide by social distancing rules.

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.    All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.    If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free. Thankyou for your support.    The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion.

10","The world is experiencing an unprecedented challenge. It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Robin Hood Fund has launched to support our city and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.    The Robin Hood Fund     Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.    In Nottingham we have a famous history of looking after one another. You could call it the spirit of Robin Hood - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.     So we are creating something called the Robin Hood Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.     Our city has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Robin Hood Fund has been set up for us to shine a light on these vital projects and help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.     Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that if possible you donate and contribute to the common good of Nottingham. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.    The spirit of Robin Hood has created something unique in our city  now is the time to reignite that spirit so please donate today if you can and if you can’t please help us spread the word.      * * *    FAQs    What can I do?    Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the vulnerable.     Where have funds been used?    Since the Robin Hood Fund started we have always had one goal  to raise as much money as possible to help those most in need.     To date; the following causes have been supported;     Since the Robin Hood Fund launched we have had one clear goal  to raise much needed funds to support the most vulnerable people in Nottingham during the Covid-19 crisis. Following an amazing response from the people and organisations of our city we have already exceeded all expectations in raising more than £75 000 which has been distributed - or is in the process of being distributed - to a number of charities and organisations undertaking such important work during these difficult times.      To date; the following causes have been supported:      Foodbanks (£20 000)    The Robin Hood Fund has distributed £20 000 in support of food banks across Nottingham. Working closely with Hope Nottingham and Nottingham Forest in the Community to deliver the wider support  food and supplies have been centrally purchased and then distributed to a number of different food banks  including: NG11 Clifton Foodbank  Meadows Foodbank  Grace Church  HOPE Nottingham  Bestwood & Bulwell Foodbank  Himmah / Muslim Hands  Arnold Foodbank and St. Ann’s Advice Centre.      Homeless Organisations (£10 000)    Emmanuel House was awarded £6 000 for additional specialist key worker support to boost its team at a time when Nottingham’s homeless community is at grave risk. This support is helping to ensure the homeless community are being placed into hotel accommodation as an emergency measure as hostels are very vulnerable to outbreaks.       There has also been £4 000 of support released to Framework to enable them to purchase essential items to the Homeless community in Nottingham. This included  but was not limited to  the provision of items such as mobile phones so that they can remain in contact with key workers and minimise the chance of these individuals being unable to stick to the government guidelines on social distancing.       Refugee Groups (£2 500)    Refugee Roots were provided with support to allow them to move from a model that required face to face contact  to being able to still provide support in a safe and socially distanced way.      In addition  Refugee Forum has been provided with funding for a destitution fund to ensure those with no access to support in other places can still get support.       Vulnerable Women (£4 500)    Nottingham Women's Centre have been awarded funding to help them to provide mental health support and online counselling  including training for counsellors to be able to provide online support.      In addition to this  further support was provided to POW Nottingham  an organisation supporting the rights of sex workers and those at risk of being exploited. This funding enabled them to purchase essential items including food and toiletries.      Disability Groups (£2 500)      With social distancing measures causing increased issues for the disability community in Nottingham  this support has enabled the Disability Support Nottingham organisation to increase its capability to provide phone support - in addition to welfare checks - to those in need.      Vulnerable Young People (£2 500)     Funding has also been provided to help support the amazing work of Nottingham YMCA  who are working with the most vulnerable young people in our city during this crisis. The support has helped to provide food and toiletries to those housed in supported YMCA and transitional accommodation.      Where will the funds go?    The most vulnerable people during this crisis and will be administered by the city council and delivered by people and organisations across the city that can help the most vulnerable.    Every Monday Nottingham City Council will administer the release of funds from GoFundMe to Nottingham City Council bank account. This means Nottingham City Council should  on average  have the money in the bank no later than Friday of every week.    Once in Nottingham City Council account the funds are ring fenced and held until the decision re: allocation has been made.    A working group  chaired by Lee Walker  will be set up to recommend how that branch of funds is released. This group is tasked with making the biggest impact possible whilst also being certain that the organisations in receipt a) need and b) promise to spend quickly ie. nobody saves the money. On Tuesday of each week the working group will have a paper approved by a member of ‘gold’ and paperwork will be sent to a small governance committee who are tasked with ethics and assuring the highest standards of governance and distribution.    Remotely the governance group will scrutinise and approve. Once approved Nottingham City Council agrees to distribute as agreed.    Money will then go out asap so groups and organisations are in receipt within 5 days. A one page press note to support and communication online to be transparent.      If I do donate will it go to those who need it?     Yes  100% of any donation will go to those who need it.    I want to help my local community; will this money be spent in Nottingham?     Yes.

them. I couldn't find anywhere and it occurred to me that whilst we had lots of foodbanks we didn't have any for children's clothes or toys and if you can't afford to put food on the table you cant afford to buy clothes or toys for your child either.    Sebby's Corner  named in honour of my late brother  began only a month ago and yet the demand for our services is increasing daily. We hear stories of families who are choosing whether to eat or heat their homes  parents who go without food so their kids can eat.     We are working with foodbanks and schools across Herts  Barnet  Middlesex and London to reach as many vulnerable families as we can.    We have been so grateful for your donations of preloved clothes and toys. You've inundated us and we can't thank you enough. Now we need your help in a different way. There are lots of items our families desperately need that we need to buy new  such as underwear  nappies  baby milk and toiletries.    We would be so grateful for your help so we don't have to turn anyone away.

Funds raised are to be shared equally between two much needed food projects in our communities  these being Lumley Methodist Church who are cooking and delivering over 115 hot meals twice a week and Bournmoor  Fence Houses & Woodstone Foodbank who are delivering many many food parcels throughout our villages. Both projects are much needed in these challenging times for vulnerable people and families in need  over 30 volunteers are involved in total across both projects.  Both Tommy & Kevin live locally and are passionate about their communities  their 10k run will take place on Saturday 9th May  to make things a little more challenging Tommy will be wearing a weighted top and Kevin will be in uniform complete with stab proof vest.  Any support at all that can be given will be very much appreciated by all in this amazing fundraiser  every little helps. Kind regards  Alan",True

Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland. Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen feed people seven days a week and will now be able to buy pallets of fresh produce to cook with  whilst the foodbank will be able to use the money to produce emergency three day food parcels.

We are an entirely self funded volunteer led group of like minded local people  young and old  who wanted to do something to help the homeless and needy in our neighbourhood. So in November 2018 we founded the Tooting Community Kitchen. Since then we have run a weekly distribution of hot food  and essential supplies. We now have 50 active volunteers and we have been able to assist hundreds of people  so far!    Currently  every Wednesday and Saturday evening our volunteers are able to provide the following help:    • We distribute food packs to a local shelter for homeless people  • We set up a stall from 5.30pm to 6.30pm next to Tooting Broadway Market where we serve hot food  soups  drinks and hand out toiletries and sanitary products  • we have recently opened our foodbank based at 104 Upper Tooting Rd  SW17 7EN  walk up Price Close. Fridays 9-1pm food donations drop off. Fridays 11-1pm open to guests to collect what they need. Our outreach volunteers visit known places where homeless people sleep in the local community and we provide them with a hot meal  a hot drink  toiletries and sanitary products and sleeping bags  • Our outreach teams are now able to serve people in areas of Wandsworth (Clapham Junction  Putney High Street  and Clapham South / Common / and North.      We urgently need donations so this much needed work can carry on in the community.     Please help us to help those in need.      Tooting Community Kitchen",True

I've got a receding hairline as it is  so what looks like a ridiculous haircut on Ronaldo will look even more ridiculous on me.

A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems. Barrow Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. There has never been a more crucial time to help those who are less fortunate than us - which is why I have organised this event.     The Covid-19 effect   Well before Covid-19 hit the UK  food banks in the Trussell Trust network had been seeing year-on-year increases in levels of need  with 1.9 million emergency food parcels given out in 2019/20. As Covid-19 hit the UK  the Trussell Trust saw an immediate and sustained surge in need across its food banks. In April there was an 89% increase in the number of emergency food parcels given out compared with the same month in 2019. This included a 107% increase in the number of parcels given to children  compared to the same period last year. New findings show that almost 100 000 households received support from a food bank in the Trussell Trust network for the very first time between April and June 2020. It's no secret that the pandemic has had a significant impact on people's jobs and finances - increasing the use of foodbanks nationwide.     What are we doing?   Since March 2020  many people (including myself) have adopted a new hobby in running. Whether it is to pass time  get out of the house  keep fit whilst the gyms are closed or a tool to manage your mental health. Everyone has their individual reasons for running and it would be fantastic to use this as an opportunity to help and support our local foodbank through completing a half marathon challenge (13.1 miles or 21.09 kilometres).     When?  Those who are taking part will complete the run on either Friday 23rd April  Saturday 24th April or Sunday 25th April - uploading their run to the page when complete.     Donations  There is a group target amount of £1 000 and every penny donated is hugely appreciated. However  I am conscious of the financial difficulties that many people face due to the current situation  therefore  it is absolutely fine if you are unable to donate - you can always share this page instead!     If you would like more information or if you would like to take part  please message me directly.     https://barrow.foodbank.org.uk/    https://www.trusselltrust.org/    ",True

Born in Tripoli  Northern Lebanon and operating in refugee camps in the Bekaa Valley throughout the COVID pandemic  we are now responding to the Beirut blast.     With the full endorsement of the Lebanese Foodbank  each of our ovens is capable of producing over 1 000 meals per day. Our plan is to greatly increase this reach by expanding our number of oven sites nationwide.     Our Work To Date    Today  the Great Oven HQ is located next to the epicenter of the blast site  in Lebanon’s most respected nightclub of all places  the Ballroom Blitz. Each day  between 10 - 20 local volunteers contribute to the preparation of meals and supplies which are then distributed to our oven sites.     Over a month on from the blast  with media fatigue setting in and many temporary relief efforts already withdrawing  our work is crucial. We believe that responses to Lebanon’s escalating crisis must be long term in their vision and center the Lebanese people as agents of their own reconstruction and resilience-building process.    By its very nature  The Great Oven is uniquely positioned to provide assistance through this framework. Not only do we set up enduring networks but our ovens are permanent installations that belong to the communities in which they are based. As centres for cooking  teaching and sharing a meal  our ovens facilitate a creative and participatory experience that brings communities together and fosters social cohesion.     Where will your support go?    The Great Oven has self-funded its operations for over two years. We are proud of our self-sustainability but now feel it is time to grow. We can’t do this without your support.    Each kind donation will be used to fund our basic operational costs  all of which are listed below:    - Production and installation of more community ovens in areas of critical need in Beirut and nationwide  - Sourcing local food produce for each oven  - Distribution of food beyond Great Oven sites across the city  - Oven transport and logistics     Our only paid salaries to date  go to marginalised people we founded our movement with. This includes LGBTQ refugees  stateless youths  trafficked women  and ex child fighters to name a few.     More about the Great Oven    We build great big beautiful ovens to feed a great number of people.     But the oven is also symbolic. It represents our belief that the ritual of cooking and sharing meals helps bring communities together  whatever their faith  ethnicity or gender.     We also believe in the rehabilitative power of music and art to restore faith that a better future is possible.     What we offer is not aid in the traditional sense  but the participatory tools to empower a community to build that future for themselves  and with those tools comes an inherent sense of dignity  which is as important as food relief in nourishing a marginalised community.     We work with grassroots  on-the-ground  local initiatives and organisers in order to respond organically and effectively to each community’s unique needs.     What we’re offering in return     The Great Oven was founded by award-winning cook  documentary filmmaker and philanthropist  James Thompson. Our wider team is a collective of chefs  artists and creative thinkers dedicated to making positive change through food and art.     We are eternally grateful for any donation  no matter how big or small. For any substantial contributions  we would like to offer a very special thank you in true Great Oven style:    Donations of £1 000 or more    A private Great Oven feast cooked by Great Oven chefs (and special guests) at your home.    Donations of £250 or more    A seat at a one-off Great Oven community feast in one of the following locations:    Barcelona  Beirut  Berlin  Denver  Dublin  Glastonbury  Johannesburg  Kuala Lumpur  Kinsale  London  Mexico City  Mumbai  New York   Valencia    These feasts will feature several special guests of the culinary  music and art worlds.

Businesses and families coming together in so many ways to help provide a good meal for our people. The true sense of community and a nation united and agreeing to understand that no matter what our personal circumstances are we can all do something to help and there could not be a better cause than our future generations chances of a decent education and life.    Me and my mum were helped many times throughout my childhood from volunteer workers  food banks  homeless housing  free school meals and many other services which were available to us. We still struggled. It scares me to think what some parents would be forced to put themselves through to make sure their child gets a meal. it scares me to think where i would be if i did not have these services available.    This is me wanting to do my bit  inspired by the amazing efforts from our entire nation  while struggling ourselves  still giving back.    We want to raise 50 THOUSAND POUNDS!!!! Every single penny will be split across local foodbanks and help services in need around greater Manchester.    What a feeling it will be to deliver such help to the most deserving people.    Please. we need 10.000 5ers     thats it! please share  please actually ask people and make them aware.    no child should go hungry.",True

The need for supplies is greater than ever!     Coronavirus is spreading  so is the hunger.     Everyone is buying online now so whatever they used to collect from collection points now they can’t. Everyone is buying (bought) in bulk so now a lot of things are not in stock in the shops.     In honour of welcoming Ramadhan I thought to call Manchester Central Food Bank and ask if they needed anything. I went shopping and delivered the items to the foodbank today (Thursday 23rd April).       But  even with a budget of £200  I did not manage to buy even a quarter of the things that the Food Bank needed. I realised quickly I cannot do it alone. The volunteers are already spending their own money but that’s only 10% of the donations. The other 90% comes from public donations which at the moment is very low.     If you want to give out in charity because of the blessed month of Ramadhan then this is your chance too.     Make sure you donate and help us provide essential food for our local community in Manchester Foodbank.    £10 can buy 5 - 10 items  £20 can buy 10 to 20 items  £50 can buy 30 to 55 items  £100 can buy 55 to 85 items    Thank you for supporting me in helping our community.     Thank you on behalf of Manchester Central FoodBank and everyone that will benefit from the Food Bank.     Find a Food Bank    Stay safe always.     Najma    UPDATE:  I did another food shop on Thursday (30th April). We bought items worth £450 and delivered to the Foodbank. We had a small car and so we could not spend all the money on this day.     We will be doing the Third Big Shop on Thursday (7th May) with the leftover but this time I have partnered with Bankeut and they will do the shop and delivery on my behalf for free.     I’ll also be doing live daily recipe demos on Instagram (sikiacooking) and/or Facebook (sikiacooking) from Sunday (3rd of May) to Saturday (9th May). Simple recipe ideas to try at home.",True

We are proud to be serving the community of Queensbury and to help during hard times  our aim is to bring the community together!     #onecommunity     This food bank has also set up a number of seasonal activities  we have organised a Santa's Grotto which is fully booked  we will not be charging anyone to participate or to take away with them a food parcel and gifts.     We are ever increasing in the number of individuals we are supporting  big or small every gift you give helps transform their lives.     Our food bank is run by local people for local people  we rely on the community's support to ensure we can continue to stop people going hungry. Can you invest in the future of our Food Bank and help us provide much-needed support to people in crisis in our community?",True

Covid 19 has seen people placed on furlough and jobs disappear  with finances becoming increasingly strained to live day to day.     As a team of Independent Usborne Organisers we have seen the demand for books to support home schooling during lockdown increase massively and we see books as an essential need  just like food. Having access to books not only improves literacy but has positive benefits to mental wellbeing too. Children are able to go on adventures  visit new countries and learn essential life skills  all from the pages of a book.     We have collectively decided to raise funds to enable our local foodbanks to provide books to the families who rely on them each week and month.     We are planning to support:    Fiona Wilkes - Kingston Upon Thames    Michelle Dalby - Epsom & Ewell    Rebecca Lawrance - West Cheshire    Sylvia Gilby - Taunton    as well as hopefully Sutton  Elmbridge  Wimbledon & Wandsworth.    Please help us  help our communities by giving any amount you can. You'll be helping develop the next generation of teachers  scientists  engineers and business leaders.    Thank you    NB - When you make a donation please ensure you select the person who referred you so your donation finds it's way to the correct foodbank.  Thank you",True

(Please support and please share)    Inchgarth has now launched the second phase of our gofundme campaign to support people during the covid-19 pandemic following your wonderful support during 2020.  We know that for many families  individuals  and businesses that things are extremely tough just now  but for those who may be able to donate a couple of pounds  then we would be hugely grateful for your support that will allow us to help those most in need.    People can donate directly via this gofundme appeal page  or if you prefer  we can accept donations of non perishable food items directly at the centre Monday to Friday 10am-5pm.    Over the last 12 months your support and wonderful donations have not only helped to sustain our organisation  but it's helped a tremendous amount of families and individuals in their greatest hour of need  and your support really has made a massive impact on their lives.    Our support project  which the foodbank is one stand of  is helping not only people in Garthdee  but 14 other communities in Aberdeen south  while we are helping many organisations to support their clients too. The need is real  the need is genuine  and every penny of your support sustains and supports.    No matter how small your donation may be  whether it's one pound  or one tin of food  it's hugely appreciated and makes a difference and we are hugely grateful  as are those benefitting from your generosity.     Thank you for all of the support during 2020  it's been amazing  and now in 2021 we strive to ensure no one slips through the net with your support.  THANK YOU FROM TEAM INCHGARTH.        ",True

We are all too aware of the huge surge in demand at foodbanks throughout 2020. They all do fantastic work  and we are going to continue supporting them.    We will be gathering on Sunday evenings through the first part of 2021 to cook hot meals and distribute them to people in need.    Working with the West End Refugee Service  we will reach between 30-50 vulnerable people every week.    So why are Dance City staff voluntarily doing this?    We are extending the work of the many organisations who are active in this area already and complementing  what they do.    Cooked meals offer the chance to use fresh vegetables which provide alternative nutrition to dry packed and long life foods.    Dance City is a publicly funded organisation. Our facility is made for public benefit and whilst the COVID 19 pandemic has paused our theatre activity and public classes  it does not mean that our facility should be redundant.    Dance City team are inspired by the everyday ways in which the public and arts organisations can help the community  which we are all part of.    Dance City Volunteer Team have secured Dance City’s Kitchen for free and our team are training in food hygiene. We need your help to raise £1500 to pay for the ingredients and distribution to provide over 350 cooked meals.    £3 will help pay for and distribute a meal for one person.    £12 will help pay for and distribute a meal for a family of four people.    £36 will help pay for and distribute a meal for an individual for 3 months.    £125 will help pay for and distribute meals for over 35 people on a single Sunday evening.    January is a challenging time for people  after a surge in generosity in giving around Christmas  and we understand the need for this initiative continues into the New Year.    We invite you to support us in this initiative to provide hot  nutritious meals to the community. If you are able to provide a hot meal for someone  we would appreciate your support.    Please donate and help us to provide hot meals to our community.    Thank you.",True

who have been struggling since the Coronavirus outbreak. Last week alone  they helped 285 families and they expect this to increase in the coming weeks. Some of our players and friends of the club  will run a combined total of 200km in one day (this Saturday 2nd of May)  and each individual will contribute with either a 5km or 10km  also ensuring the governments social distancing guidelines are adhered to. (Runners will go out on their own) We would encourage family members  pals  work colleagues to join in and/or donate. We’re aiming to do something positive for the community by helping those who are less fortunate in difficult times. If you can spare a few quid then it would go a long way! Thank you.",True

Each cyclist fundraising goal is to end hunger  for at least the next 6 months  for their own family and 90 other families in need of food support by raising funds for the Siem Reap Food Bank through the ride.    https://www.lifecyclecambodia.org/    The cyclists have several things in common:  They are all strong  capable  cool  fun-loving  and admirable.  They each grew up in poverty and it is still a daily concern for themselves and their families  especially now with the economic impact of COVID-19.  They are motivated to help others who need food and health support.  They all have a physical disability due to either birth defects  illness  or accidents (landmine  traffic  industrial etc.).

Who is the Inspiration behind the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event and The Siem Reap Food Bank    Naret Chhoy  is a jewellery and clothing designer and Director and Trustee at Genevieve’s Fair Trade Village in Siem Reap. The shop supports and celebrates the work of people and artists living with disabilities.     Having lost her job with the closure of the shop since the outbreak of the pandemic  this incredible and inspiring woman  with her own disability  is devoting her time and amazing efforts to help some of the most vulnerable families in the community with Essential Care Food Packs.    Naret is one of the amazing 9 Cyclists riding in the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event to raise money for the Siem Reap Food Bank that her and many other volunteers founded in April to support vulnerable families in need of food support due to Covid19.       Your Generous Donation Today Can Help by Feeding a Family of 4 for 80 pence a Day with the Siem Reap Food Bank.    The Basic Care Food Package costs just £26 pounds  which can feed and help sustain an average family of 4 people for one month!    That's less than the average family of 4 people in the UK would spend on one takeout meal a month!     Donor Fees​ - GoFundMe adds a default Tip of 15% to each donation to help them maintain and improve their free platform. The GoFundme Tip is voluntary and you can change the default tip amount when you donate. The minimum donation amount is £5    There are so many families that need your help more than ever  with your kind and generous support your donations (no matter how much you can afford to give ) means we can help keep their physical and mental health intact throughout this Covid19 Pandemic by helping them survive  whilst offering them a glimmer of hope for the future.     Siem Reap Province - Cambodia    Siem Reap is a beautiful idyllic tourist town just a stone's throw away from the spectacular Angkor Wat Archeological Park in Cambodia.    ""If you have ever been to Siem Reap  or Cambodia in general  you will know how warm  friendly  kind and compassionate the Khmer people are"".    Since the lockdown began  hardly any tourists are visiting the city  with visitor numbers to the Angkor world heritage site down by 99.5%  only 650 people visited the Temple in the month of April  that's 20 people per day compared to around 5 000 back in January.    This situation has created a major problem in Siem Reap. The average wage in the city for people who worked within or in connection with the tourist industry is around $4 USD per day  that's less than $3.50p for around 10 hours work or 35 pence an hour.    The city is more or less totally deserted with literally no visitors  there is no money being spent  no income….nothing…zero. As you can imagine  if you were only earning $4 a day ""in normal circumstances""  then you can probably understand why many families really don’t have any ability to save money to help themselves get through the times when the going gets tough…really tough.     There are many reports of people hearing children crying themselves to sleep at night through hunger.     Many families are trying to live off the land by foraging for fruit and vegetables  frogs  snakes and Rats etc  but the basic essentials that we all take for granted in the UK such as Rice  Eggs  Cooking Oil  Salt and Sugar are products that thousands of families in Siem Reap simply can no longer afford.     Real Hunger exists  in Siem Reap Province  because a large number of families  living at or below the poverty line  do not have enough money to consistently put food on the table.    Job losses  due to Covid 19  have pushed the total number of hungry families to an estimated 20 000. That means as many as 80 000 souls in the Province  are going bed hungry tonight without knowing where there next meal will come from.    Why the Siem Reap Food Bank?    Having lived and experienced an amazing life in South East Asia for over 18 years  I wanted to contribute in a meaningful way  to help some of the most vulnerable people through the ongoing Covid 19 crisis.    After many discussions with my wonderful friend  Christopher Leonard who is currently living there and witnessing first-hand the stone cold reality of the situation  we decided together to spend considerable time researching and validating food giveaway programs currently operating in Siem Reap.    Christopher  spent quality time with Naret and Rick and we could both see that with more money  international awareness and resources  The Siem Reap Food Bank could reach out to so many more families in desperate need of support.    The Siem Reap Food Bank continues to make a real sustainable difference to people in risk of extreme poverty and hunger.     So I decided to volunteer my time to support this incredibly important project and I wanted to share with you why I have chosen this specific Food Bank.    The Siem Reap Food Bank initially launched in April to provide Essential Care Food Packages to people living with disabilities to help them survive the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.     The Siem Reap Food Bank support families headed by or including people with a disability  that have seen their livelihoods disappear  along with the tourists and shops  restaurants  hotels and businesses being shut down.    With the situation continuing to get worse it soon became clear that the Siem Reap Food Bank would not just need to support families with disabilities through this unprecedented time  but any families identified to be in urgent need of an Essential Care Food Package to help them survive.    How Your Kind Donation Helps These Families:    Below is one example of a family the Siem Reap Food Bank is helping every month with a £26 Essential Care Food Package:    Mai Lin  a single mom of 4 children  all under the age of 12  suffered a paralysing stroke about 5 years ago. At the time  she was overwrought with fear that she would no longer be able to take care of her babies.     However  she learned how to make shopping bags from old newspapers and the income generated was sufficient for her to support her family and was even enough to send her children to school. Mai Lin’s income dried up completely with the closure of the Genevieve’s Fair Trade Village shop that sold her products  at the onset of the CoVid19 shutdown.     Along with her first food drop  just before Khmer New Year (April 13th 2020)  came the promise of monthly food drops until she is able to get back to making a living for herself to ensure her family survives.      What's Contained in a Monthly Essential Care Food Package:      We only need 1 000 people from across world to donate as little as as £10 pounds (less than then the price of a few takeout coffees) to succeed in reaching our campaign goal to support 100 families.    Please  help us meet our funding goal by making any donation you can afford.     We know that this is very tough time for many  so if you are unable to donate funds can please help us by sharing this appeal in any way you can via ( social media  friends and family as well as any networks you have connections with) help us create awareness and momentum for this ongoing humanitarian crisis.    On behalf of the families you are helping  thank you for your kindness  you really are making a life changing difference.    Myself and Christopher are volunteering for the Siem Reap Food Bank  with Christopher managing the Life Cycle Cambodia 2020 Event and I'm helping to create awareness for the gofundme campaign.     GoFundMe does not operate in Cambodia. Therefore  I started this campaign in the UK on their behalf with a Funding Goal to support 100 families that's 400 hundred people we can help and support over the next six months.     We project that at the very earliest tourists may return to visit Angkor Wat  in December 2020.    Be kind - Be Loving - Be Safe    Akhun Charan (Thank you very much in Khmer)    Brian Taylor & Christopher Leonard    Important information about how funds for this campaign are being processed & delivered to the Siem Reap Food Bank    I am a volunteer for The Siem Reap Food Bank  I'll be assisting them with social media campaigns to increase UK and international awareness. GoFundMe does not operate in Cambodia. Therefore  I started this campaign in the United Kingdom on their behalf to assist them to help an many families as they can.     I solemnly pledge that 100% of all funds raised through this campaign site are automatically transferred to my UK Bank account and then transferred directly into the Siem Reap Food bank ABA bank account in Cambodia.     HOW DONATIONS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED    Our goal is to make sure the Siem Reap Food bank has continuous cash flow to purchase food & other essential items throughout the coming months  therefore monies will be transferred to their bank account on a regular basis.     The Siem Reap Food Bank Use of Funds: To purchase and distribute essential food and health items for families in need of food support living throughout the Siem Reap province.    Essential costs: To pay for the products being purchased and supplied  plus a few dollars for delivery.    The Siem Reap Food Bank accounting is up-to-date and open to inspection. ​    Donor Fees​ - GoFundMe adds a default Tip of 15% to each donation to help them maintain and improve their free platform. The GoFundme Tip is voluntary and you can change the default tip amount when you donate. The minimum donation amount is £5    ""How to change the default tip amount"" - www.gftv-sr.org/gfmtip.html    We will regularly update our gofundme page so you'll be kept informed on how much you donations are making a significant contribution in sustaining families and saving lifes.    There are so many families that need your help more than ever  with your support and donations (no matter how much you can afford to give ) we can help keep their physical and mental health intact throughout this Covid19 Pandemic by helping them survive  whilst offering them a glimmer of hope for the future.

Please see the update below 25/10/20: FREE KIDS MEALS With the recent announcements that no help will be given during the half term to provide lunches  along with Marcus Rashford campaign and New Vision Opticians in Rayners Lane  we would like to offer a packed lunch for children who may need it. If you  or you know of a family that may struggle to feed your children this half term  please email or message us and a packed lunch will be provided; no judgements or questions asked. Thank you from us and New Vision Opticians. (Up until 24/10/20 we had raised £3500 over the lockdown; the balance to date is the generosity over a week by all you amazing people)     (11/4/20)After being approached by local organisations  we have extended our donations to include essentials for care homes and Harrow FoodBank.    WHY? Being born and raised in Harrow  the team behind Red Cup Cafe want to show their appreciation for the dedication and care shown by the all the staff at Northwick Park Hospital.    We started off by personally donating non-perishable foods and essential items  and as the word spread  people started to approach as us to how they can also help.     Thus  with the encouragement from our family  friends and customers  we have set up this fundraising page for those that wish to donate whatever they can in order for us to purchase the much needed essentials for our NHS Heroes.    The support already shown by our local community has been tremendous but we can do more with your help  so we please urge you to donate any amount  however small  to help us reach our goal.    Eternally grateful to you all and to all those that are caring for the nation in these difficult times. Please stay safe; stay at home; protect the NHS and save lives.",True

Wycombe Food Hub (WFH) came about at the start of lockdown. We collected residual food from leading supermarkets. Our products are often short dated and expired ‘Best Before End’ (BBE) dates. These products are still usable. The range varies on what we source each week from our partners. During the peak we were collecting over 200 green crates each week and supplying food to partner organisations who were using our produce in 100 meals a week plus 1000 food bags a week What we do We supply products to people unable to access or buy food  those that cannot get Government aid or are unable to survive on the Government’s benefit payments  those who are now suffering from loss of jobs and the self-employed who can’t get benefits  those who cannot access the traditional referral foodbanks. Also  Police referrals  refugees  pensioners  YMCA residents  homeless. The range of people coming to us for help is growing weekly. Considering what’s happening nationally the need for our food and services will continue to grow. Our growth We secured a small warehouse(room) and opened a market stall under the Guildhall in High Wycombe twice a week for 2 hours. We are now collecting over 300 green crates week and giving out 150 bags of food in 4 hours each week. In addition  supplying food to our partner organisations who are feeding in excess of 300 people a week. What is next We have now become a social enterprise CIC to allow us to formalise what we are doing. We have now secured a retail shop in the centre of High Wycombe. The shop will be open a minimum of 3 days a week. We have a warehouse in the store where we can sort and distribute food. This will allow us to both run the shop feeding those in need and also supply our partner organisations who need our fresh produce. We are now collecting from even more supermarkets  allotments and farms. More outlets are coming online in next few weeks. The shop allows us to distribute not only residual food but also offer chilled and frozen food. Partner organisations are now working with us and will be taking space in store to signpost and help those needing more care and referral to statutory authorities. Financial support and sponsorship Moving into a retail premises has now incurred us some long-term financial liabilities and we need to reach out for help What we are fundraising for This includes building  building refurb  building future repairs  liability and building insurance  equipment and software  electricity and utilities  print and collateral . Website and internet/email. In addition  in order to supplement our residual food collections  we need to purchase extra food and products we don't get from supermarkets. This is purchased from Fareshare and other sources We started with a zero funding stream. We have managed to secure some small grants and donations from friendly benefactors which has allowed us to deliver to the stage we are now .

But ideally we would still like to raise the money we would have made in ticket sales from these two gigs to help the two food banks they would have supported.    We have set our target amount roughly at 80% of all available tickets sold to both events which would have been £2 560.

As the lockdown is eased  some people will be more aware than others that the pandemic is not over.    The most vulnerable people - those who have been shielded  have been receiving food parcels. They have been advised that they no longer have to shield beyond August 16th. We believe that this means that they will no longer get their weekly food parcel.    We are also aware of other people who for whatever reason  can’t get enough food. Predictions are for greater economic squeezes  which means that more people will fall into this category.    Prior to covid  the office of Leanne Wood in Porth had worked with the free-share scheme to offer free food to people who wanted it: this is food that the supermarkets would normally throw away. This food was provided on a non-means tested basis to anyone who could make use of it. (We also worked closely with the Rhondda foodbank to provide non-perishable food to them that they could make use of for people in need).    This scheme has to be put on hold when covid broke because it was not possible to do it while social distancing.    Social distancing is still an issue  but food poverty and food need is a growing problem. With the shielded group no longer having their weekly food parcel from mid August - and with supermarkets sending food to landfill if it can’t be distributed - all means we need to restart the scheme  but do it differently.    This is where you can help.    We need to raise money - around £5 000 should enable us to operate a scheme up until the end of the year.    We can then purchase extra items so that together with the supermarket excess  we can make up balanced food parcels for anyone who asks for one.    We will be relying on our team of Plaid Cymru councillors as well as the network of volunteers to both pack food and deliver it to people throughout the Rhondda.    If you can donate and also share this link on your social media channels  that would help this new project immensely.    Back in March  nearly six hundred people in the Rhondda responded to a call-out to sign up as a community volunteer  to be a part of a network to support and keep an eye out for others in their community as the covid pandemic took hold and people had major concerns about lockdown.    Some of those volunteers carried out weekly shopping and collected monthly prescriptions for their neighbours all the way through lockdown. This Rhondda network demonstrates what a fantastic community we live in. People here have been through so much with floods  precarious economic conditions  the loss of so many important local services - yet we still band together to help those who need it.

We demand the University of Birmingham:  * Gives an above RPI inflation pay increase to all support staff;  * Becomes a Living Wage Accredited employer;  * Eliminates the gender pay gap by 2020;  * Fixes the Support Staff pay spine & allocates a budget for it;  * Negotiates with all unions on the joint unions' report on working conditions at the university (available on our website).    Hundreds of caterers  cleaners  security guards and other support staff who are members of UNISON at the University of Birmingham are in dispute with the University of Birmingham and have taken strike action on the University's Open Day on Friday 28th June as they feel let down by the University’s senior management. Unless the University of Birmingham's senior managers are prepared to address our demands  we will have no other choice but to continue to take strike action.     This strike is notable within the sector  as this is the only union branch in the Higher Education to succeed in taking strike action over the 18-19 negotiations. This comes after almost a year of failed negotiations over fair pay  living wage accreditation  closing the gender pay gap  and meaningful negotiations on a joint report of demands written together with the other trade unions on campus  says UNISON today. More than three quarters of the university staff balloted (79 per cent) voted in favour of strike action over last year’s dispute.    Senior managers at the University have persistently refused to negotiate with the unions and instead imposed a below inflation pay rise (2%) on the majority of staff. The University has also been sluggish to address the gulf between men and women’s salaries at the institution  with women earning on average less than 20% than their male counterparts  have refused to accredit  and have only been ready to restructure the pay spine if the unions were prepared to agree on worse conditions such as sick pay  overtime pay  and holiday entitlements.    The first day of action was held on Friday 28th June  on a very sunny day which was also the University's Open Day: food  music  and joyful discussions over everyone’s vision of the University are being held  and prospective students and their parents are finding out about the struggles staff are facing on campus.     In the absence of accreditation  pay at the university could fall below the Real Living Wage  meaning staff would struggle to make ends meet. ‘We already know that members have turned to foodbanks to feed their families’  says UNISON. ‘Many low-paid staff only work 15 hours per week and often hold several jobs to make ends meet. Senior managers seem happy to promote the excellent research undertaken by academics on social inequalities but are failing to see that they are often driving this inequality through the way they treat their own employees’.    Last year  the University set up a new ‘wholly-owned subsidiary company’ called the Edgbaston Park Hotel  and outsourced 40 staff. The Hotel does not recognise unions for new members (meaning that they cannot take strike action  for instance)  and new staff are being paid only £8.21/hour. Their contracts are much worse compared to those of the University of Birmingham’s employees. This year  Hotel staff received a 1p/hour pay rise  while the University’s VC earns £444 000/year from the University  is waiting to receive a one-off £80 000 bonus  and also receives £90 000/year as Chair of the academic and academic related staff’s USS pensions scheme.

Our family were in awe by his altruistic desire to give  feed and aid ALL  despite race/ethnicity/religion among him even whilst suffering himself.     Since opening  our family alone have vetted 25 families with monthly food rations from December 2019- present. Unfortunately  25 families do not cover the innumerable amount of people starving  for whom we want to share some light  hope and nurture to amidst dark times  that is their indefinite reality.    Our foodbank prioritises poor families with children  single mothers/widowers and those who themselves or their children suffer with debilitating mental/physical health issues trying to make ends meet to provide for their children- this is done with rigorous checks by our team to ensure nobody exploits such a service. The families are issued with a monthly ration card valid for 12 months which provides them with stock for each month as per the individual needs of the family. These include: 10kg chapati flour (atta)  5kg sugar  5kg various lentils/daal  5kg rice  5L cooking oil  tea leaves  salt  spices and other necessary food items. £25 will feed a family of 5 for the month however any donation  no matter how big or small will impact them greatly.     100% of the donationsgo to those in need  with our incredible staff being voluntary workers (so no wages or salaries are deducted from donations) and our facilities funded with the finances that the late Safdar Hussain Shah left behind for us to carry this out in his legacy- we are relying on your kind donations which will solely provide stock for the families.     During the current COVID-19 crisis  we are aiming to try and provide emergency food supplies to all those suffering in the locale  with the most vulnerable holding priority  we are giving out thousands of food rations but are broken to see that we are unable to extend our help to everyone that needs it- as a small start-up charity  we are grateful for all the support and donations we receive in order to help us reach as many individuals suffering from the crisis as possible.     Unfortunately  we can't do this alone  with the power of unity together we can help fill the stomachs of the poor  not only with food but also the fulfilment of life and hope they may gradually receive from your donations. Our brothers and sisters around the globe need us  we are united by our efforts.   Any donation  no matter how big or small will be greatly appreciated especially in the blessed month of Ramadan  whereby charity is considered its greatest.     We are not the givers  we are just Allah SWT  the Almighty's  servants and can only give what he allows and wishes to be given. The families we aim to feed is by the grace of Allah SWT and it is he who provides to all.     May Allah SWT accept this from you and me  may we fulfil our duty by helping those in need  for which it is their right upon you and I.    “A man’s true wealth is the good he does in this world.” Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W)    Instagram: sadaqajariya.foodbank for further updates",True

We are raising money to help provide a free meal to those people and families In Dunfermline who are struggling at this difficult time.     Dunfermline Foodbank is doing a wonderful job as is ""Food for your Future."" However  there is still a great need. Some parents struggling with stress  anxiety and mental health even find it difficult to prepare a meal.    We are aiming to provide 100 FREE meals per day to those who are in need. We are collaborating with local High Schools and primary schools to get the offer to those who could do with a little helping hand right now.    Sometimes the hardest thing for us all to do is to receive a little helping hand from time to time. We are all in this together and we are coming together to try and help in some small way. The sharing of what we have with others is what binds communities together and makes them stronger.    With that in mind we are offering free meals to those in need on a TRIAL 6 DAY period from Tuesday 12th May to Sunday 17th of May.    This had been funded by generous donations and by the Vine church because we all #loveDunfermline.    We are also looking into applying for government funding to do this on a medium to long-term basis.    If you would like to help us keep this service available please consider donating toward our fund.

The fall off in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that we have had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased our costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries.

It was later discovered that John had suffered a brain aneurysm.         Since John’s (Riveley's) passing the family has been inundated with hundreds of messages. Friends  family and loved ones from every aspect of John’s life have been reaching out with sentiments of their own grief and reflections on his life. Upon meeting John  one would immediately discover a gentle  friendly man whose warmth  cheerful demeanour and genuine kindness is unmatched. John touched so many with his humble  unassuming and selfless acts of service. Wherever there was a need you would find John there  not as the centre of attention  but a driving force to make things happen. What you would have also been aware of is John's deep love for God  and that in all things he put his trust in Him to direct his life  no matter what the circumstances. John leaves behind Julie his wife of 18 years and two young sons Caleb and Joshua  aged 8 and 11. John had a big heart with lots of love to give and also leaves behind two current foster sons and several previous foster children who remained a regular part of his life. John was born on the beautiful island of Mauritius and leaves behind his precious mother affectionately known to many as Grandmère; four siblings  Jenny  James  Donald and Shirley (Little Sis); three neices Karisa  Saphea and Nia; and two nephews  Courtnei and Joseph. John was a role model father and devoted son and brother with his eye keenly fixed on the needs of everyone in the family. John’s untimely passing has unfortunately happened at a time when so many are facing emotional and financial challenges. Millions around the world can relate to our experience of sudden loss. Just over a week ago John’s wife would never have expected to face the significant void that John’s death has left in her life. There have been many offers of support and this go fund me appeal is a practical vehicle for individuals to reach out to Julie  Joshua and Caleb at this difficult time as the family makes arrangements to lay John to rest.       The first video attached provides a tiny glimpse of the unfailing love that John had for his children. His youngest son Caleb  attentive  loyal and constantly by his Dad's side  ready to lap up whatever fun and laughter naturally radiated from the heart of his father.       In the second video attached you will witness a celebration of life. The strength you will see as John’s Eldest son Joshua pays tribute to his father publicly within two hours of hearing the sad news of his passing is remarkable. Joshua’s faith demonstrated through his confidence and composure in the face of such loss is a testimony and a legacy of the life of his father Riveley John Michael Choyen. Joshua’s performance flowed out of love for his father and actively testified to the neighbouring community that we mourn  but not as others do  because like our brother John we have the blessed hope of life eternal. John will be sadly missed  but we know that Jesus is coming soon and we will see him again.      Just one week later Joshua and Caleb participated in an online concert “Songs of Hope” to raise money for their local NHS hospital (Croydon University Hospital) and the local foodbank. Their parents have instilled strong values of giving back to the community and these commitments were made before the tragedy struck. In spite of their own grief the boys faithfully participated in the concert dedicating their performance (clip provided below) to their beloved dad.    ",True

I started to think how the community could   help  and thought a pay it forward scheme  could come in useful.  Pay it forward schemes work  by people   donating the cost of a child’s/children’s meals  to the fundraiser  and in turn a meal will be   delivered to their door!  I asked the wonderful people at Gold  leaf catering if they would help out  and being   the superstars that they are  they agreed!  So  we’re asking for £4.25 to go towards   feeding a child  and it will be brought to your   door.   If you need to ask for help then please inbox.  all details will be anonymous.  Any cash not used will be donated to local   foodbanks.  Many Thanks  Jenny ",True

This support started when there was no halal food support in the local area of Sharrow and Netheredge and people were struggling to buy basic food for themselves. Due to a gap in the area and a desperate need TSY collaborated with few others to collectively reach out to the most vulnerable including single parents  elderly  self isolating and hardship such as loss of income. All our work is voluntary and since March kind donations from local community has assisted us in making sure no one struggled alone. We are running low on cash donations to purchase food to continue this vital support and are reaching out to anyone who can support us by using this link and donating whatever little they can towards the Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank project. Due to the level of need and referrals coming in since the start of this halal foodbank  we have called it Netheredge and Sharrow foodbank to avoid any barriers to any non-muslim vulnerable that maybe in need of this support.

We need your help to continue to provide for all those in need of support just now.    Since Lockdown in March 2020  the Punjab Restaurant in Covent Garden has been cooking to feed anybody and everybody in need. More than 100 000 hot meals have been provided to homeless organisations; Nishkam SWAT  Gur Seva  Under One Sky and our local church St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square. During the first lock down half the restaurant was converted to HQ  packing and storage facility for Under One Sky. We are doing the same for this second lock down.     Despite business being affected by the pandemic  in our 74 years  the Punjab has never closed its kitchens. MD Amrit Maan has been determined to make the restaurant a community resource to help as many as possible through this difficult moment in history.    All this has been possible with the goodwill of our staff  our own reserves and ability to purchase in bulk  but also from donations of food from businesses that had to close and partnering charities.     Our ""engine"" – our kitchen and volunteering staff - is running at full speed  with the Covent Garden community spirit.       BUT we now need your support to purchase raw ingredients and containers to see struggling families and the homeless through the festive period and into January.    Your donations will be used for basic healthy ingredients: potatoes  onions  cauliflower  baked beans  chick peas  red split lentils and rice.     The cost per serving/box is approximately £1.50 and we’re asking for just 60p towards each serving. We need to serve 1000 meals a week  so our £4800 target will result in 8000 meals to those struggling daily  though we note the need is only increasing.      We’ll be posting regular updates of how your donations are being spent and who it has helped.     It is getting colder every day and we’re heading towards the festive holidays  which will be a difficult one for so many more this year. Even £2 will provide 3-4 servings.     Please dig deep and help if you can – every little counts.",True

Our party no longer trusts in the ‘generosity’ of Westminster to bridge the centuries old North-South divide. This tried and tested approach is destined to fail. The centrality of London  with its capacity to gobble-up all of this country’s assets  is built into the very fabric of the ‘United Kingdom.’ Infrastructure  people  resources  opportunities: all filter south by design. We believe  then  that only through a referendum – with a resounding ‘yes’ – will we solve  once and for all  that vast array of economic and social disparities that split this island in two. We have over 200 active volunteers using a free Slack workspace. But we have hundreds more signed up and waiting to join. Our next obstacle to overcome is to invest in a membership system and organisational tools so we can become sustainable and begin organising activities leading up to us challenging council seats in the local elections of 2021.     We are a transparent party run by ordinary Northerners. We have no secret donors or other means of generating an income. Our spend to date on the movement was £1.19 to register a domain name. But we have reached the point where we cannot go any further without incurring some additional expenses.

We aim to run the equivalent distance of Landsend to John O'Groats roundtrip.. A grand total of 2814km between 41 participants over 25days.    We are a mixture of very fit boys and very un-fit parents punishing ourselves to achieve this goal for local charities.    In this unforgiving  indiscriminate and horrible pandemic our focus is on the children and young people with in our local communities in Doncaster. Doncaster has high unemployment rates and the child poverty within the borough is amongst the highest nationally. The pandemic has impacted families even greater across the borough causing more children to fall into the trap of poverty. More and more families are having to rely on Foodbanks and community initiatives to feed and clothe their children.  We appreciate the initiatives that have been set up all over the borough to support families and children  to ensure that children have food and access to the right support  we also appreciate that these services need more support to continue with their essential work. We are also aware that   within he borough especially  domestic abuse rates have risen which causes further strain on children’s mental health and wellbeing. Not only children are suffering the impact of poverty  they are also suffering the long term effects of abuse. We feel every little help we can provide to support them and help give them hope is worthy doing.  We will be dividing the proceeds between Doncaster Children’s Trust who work with families throughout Doncaster and Edlington Community Organisation who work with families within the village of Edlington . Both are organisations that have worked tirelessly to make a positive change to the lives of families and children.  Please spare any amount you can to motivate this motley crew to achieve their amazing goal.     Thank you",True

Currently  there is a huge need to help support the food banks  as so many people are needing additional help  to put food on the table  which is where the idea came from.    Many people leading up to the bank holiday would be planning where they are going to stay overnight camping or in their vans or on holiday  sadly for the VE-Day weekend that can no longer happen. So why dont we celebrate at home ?    So the idea is simple plan your trip based at home  prepare everything you need to go camping  stay overnight on the drive in your van  a tent in your garden  or even in your house (but it must be set up like a camping trip)  or in your caravan.     So how do we raise funds ?   Donate a minimum of £5 in the pot or the amount you would normally have paid for a night camping at your favourite spot during the bank holiday weekend.  If local to Nailsea  the money will go to food bank in Nailsea  if not to the national food bank network  every £ will make a difference.    Its not just about fundraising  so let's have some fun  go to town decorating your place of accommodation  take pictures  upload them to the Facebook page  use your imagination to have an amazing night or more 'away at home!'",True

We have been taken back by the number of people requiring help.     We've partnered up with Tesco  Marks & Spencers & The Corner Cake Shop who are providing any excess stock they can give away. We have a wonderful community that has been generously purchasing a little extra with their weekly shop and kindly donating it to the cause  but unfortunately  we are still lacking some vital resources.    We want to raise £1 000 to be able to purchase food directly ourselves and provider our team of volunteers with the correct PPC gear while they are out making donations.     No one is sure how long this lockdown will last  and it will get worse before it's better. We will be running this service to at least the next three months. If the crisis lasts longer  we will continue until we see fit.     EMB is a not-for-profit organisation - every penny goes directly back into providing resources. If you can't financially donate  please considering dropping off any fresh or long-life food to our HQ on Molesworth Road.     If you'd like to volunteer and help out within the community  please join our Facebook group - Mid Ulster Corona Virus Community Support Network    Now more than ever  we must look out for each other and protect those in the community that require help. Please consider donating your time  money or talent to this cause.     ",True

With the current situation we find ourselves in due to Covid-19  I have been inspired by the things we have seen our communities doing for each other. Within those communities  you have individuals who may shop  cook or even cut grass for people at risk or our key workers  but then you have pillars of the community such as the Greyfriars that do so much more. Not only do they help individuals with foodbanks as an example  but they are an important part of the Irish heritage and support the community in more ways than some realize. The Greyfriars has been the host to many an amazing night with some great memories with our friends and family. The team are like family to us all  and I know my late mum thought the world of that place and the people that run and drink there  and she always had a great judge of character. If my mum was here now  she would be doing anything she could to help the club and keep it open  she had such great time for that place and the people involved behind the scenes (obvious soft spot for Paul ) With the club being so important to our community  I want to help them as much as possible to allow them to continue to offer what they do for us all. So  that being said  from Monday 18th I am going to challenge myself to run 100km in 30 calendar days to raise as much money as we possibly can for the Greyfriars. That’s 25km a week give or take… as I write this  i am slightly worried for myself. I am just under 20stone and nearly 40 years of age… very much out of shape  so this is going to be a huge challenge for me. I know my mum would be supporting this and be proud of the fact we are pulling together  so when I am hurting (and it will hurt)  this will give me the inspiration I need.

Many individuals and families have suffered additional hardship during this period and demand for foodbank services has increased significantly over this time and continues to rise. The ending of the furlough scheme at the end of October is likely to result in this demand increasing further as more people are unfortunately likely to be made redundant.    The foodbank at Danebury Drive has been run since the start of lockdown by one individual from her own front garden. Initially this was on a small scale helping a number of local families  but has grown significantly to the point where currently 50 food parcels are produced weekly with an addition 75 individuals access the food on offer for collection for themselves and families.    As a result  the foodbank has become a valuable resource for families on the North and East sides of Acomb. This is one of a network of community foodbanks set up across the city who are all working together to share resources best they can.    The onset of winter means that to continue premises need to found as running this outside with no cover will no longer be viable. Premises have been found at a local church with the offer of a peppercorn rent. In addition to rent funding will be required to cover rent and fuel costs    The foodbank currently receives a significant amount of food donations from Co-op  Fareshare and Morrisons amongst others which is mainly of items such as bread and non-perishable items. Whilst the support has been amazing  this rarely provides sufficient fresh items to support the need  hence the additional purchase of such items mentioned above. Clearly such nutritional items are required for an individual to have a balanced diet  made more important by the fact that many children are supported by the bank.    Up to date the £250pw for fresh items has been covered by a weekly £200pw purchase of produce by a local charity (Kitchen for Everyone York) with the additional made up by the small amount of monetary donations received at the foodbank. However  the current level of support from Kitchen for Everyone cannot be maintained and their support has dropped to £100pw due to a shortage of funding. This level of funding will be continued until the end of 2020.    The costs of powering the fridge freezers and fuel for collection has been borne by the individual running the bank  but this cannot be maintained.    Your help is requested to help continue the service that has been so invaluable for the local community  especially as there are concerns that demand is more likely to increase in the short term rather than decline.",True

The HRFC development team are asking you to swap your comfortable beds for a sleeping bag / duvet and pick an unusual spot in the house or garden  spending a night out of your bed to help support a local community charity.      The Salvation Army in Hawick has been running a foodbank for a number of years in Hawick and in recent times  it has been vital in supporting the local community as the full effects of the pandemic were unfolding  more and more people were needing support. Since the beginning of Lockdown one in March 2020 the Salvation Army have provided 462 food parcels in excess of £23 100 value to the people of Hawick and its surrounding communities. This number continues to grow each day as poverty effects those from all corners of the community.      The event aims to raise some much-needed funds for the foodbank and to support its ongoing work within Hawick. Additionally  the event will allow that’s players who are involved within the ‘School of Rugby’ programme from Hawick HS and Hawick Youth RFC to deliver and be part of an event the contributes positively towards their local community.      So  if you have a shed  garage  tent  bath or even if you make a den in the living  please help support the players  coaches  volunteers and development officers in taking part in this community wide event  supporting with the fund raising efforts so that a local charity can continue their much needed  amazing work for Hawick.

Since the outbreak of Covid-19  we have drastically changed the way we are working. We have switched to delivery-only food parcels in Moulsecoomb & Bevendean  and have seen an increase in demand from the first week. With more than 50 households now on our delivery list  we are in constant need of food donations. Many kind people  organisations and businesses have supported us  but to make sure we are able to continue delivering to an ever-increasing amount of households in our area  we are now seeking more support to be able to buy in food and items we desperately need but not always get through donations. We know the need won't end when the outbreak and lockdown is over  and any funding will help us bridge to a way back to our drop-in sessions. We expect that even when the Food bank can open its doors again  and people can come out to socialise and get advice and support in person  the world will still look different  so we want to be prepared for this transition period. Your support is very much appreciated by community we support and the many fantastic volunteers we are supported by. THANK YOU from all of us at the Bevendean Foodbank Committee.

This gave James his altruistic idea - That if people would like to encourage him to do it  by way of sponsorship  and other people can benefit from what he’s doing  then why would he get in the way of such generosity?!    As food and basic health needs are so fundamental/crucial for the people in the world who are most struggling  he would like the raised monies to go to the local food bank and/or care needs in the community.  St. Andrews Foodbank says:    “Those we serve may have lost their job  had a family split up  be victims of domestic violence  or had benefits delayed or suspended. In desperate times we are able to meet their immediate need for food.”  May we extend our human kindness to them.    How?  So  to make it easier for you to give  if you feel inclined  I’ve set up this page.    I will post updates between now and the end of May  by which he hopes to be able to complete a 5km run  actually running  for the half hour that the programme builds runners up to (and do the remainder by whichever means)!    What makes this a challenge  you might ask?   Doesn’t James do the Parkrun?    Indeed  James has done the Parkrun  before  and consistently since my Mum died  a year ago today  20th April.    He also has angina  a heart condition which makes running that bit more challenging for his body. So he will be doing it gradually/sustainably.    His mind/heart  whilst keeping it fit and agile - as well as desiring to support other people in the community to be well and healthy - is determined. How can you help?    With the challenge food banks face in receiving food from their usual sources (church congregations  supermarkets etc)  you giving money to this cause will ensure food banks are stocked  and people who need the support they offer can still access it.    Thank you for your generous support and donations.    Amitaśūrī  and James    ",True

I'm proud to have played a small part in helping to organise a few of these fundraising gigs over the last few years. Whilst we cannot arrange any performances in venues at the moment the movement continues virtually and I have arranged an online get together on Friday 29th May to celebrate my birthday. Money raised will go towards the High Street Community Hub foodbank. As well as volunteering there I have been extremely grateful to them for accepting referrals from the Beeston Chilwell Area Mutual Aid Group that I helped to set up. It is no exaggeration to say that people in need would be going hungry without their ongoing efforts of solidarity.     I feel truly blessed to have so many talented friends who have agreed to perform for this fundraiser in collaboration with WSO Nottingham and hopefully raise some much needed funding for the fabulous work being undertaken here in Broxtowe by the High Street Community Hub. Please join me for the evening of Friday 29th May  invite friends and donate if you are able. The live performances and videos will be shared in a private Facebook Group that you need to join via the following link - https://www.facebook.com/groups/2648510692141215/    IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM ACCESSING THE EVENT PLEASE EMAIL OR PHONE - [email redacted] / 07501453628.

For years now she has written about and directly helped hundreds of people affected by welfare reforms.    She inspired me to start writing in 2017 and now I find myself wanting to give something back.    Charlotte doesn't get any money for her writing  bar small donations.    I want to transform her situation  give her a bigger platform  and boost her confidence.    The initial plan is to raise £12 500 to give Charlotte a monthly wage of £2000 before tax  this would be £1 627.81 monthly after tax.    The company  Black Isle Journalism Ltd  would contribute 5% to a NEST pension  with Charlotte the minimum 3%  under the Workplace Pension Scheme.    Charlotte will be given free reign to write  transform and design Black Isle Media.    The remaining £500 would be to cover website costs and expenses.    Any profit from ads on Charlotte's articles would be given to her 60/40 split in her favour. This will enable the company to pay NI and PAYE costs.    It is hoped Charlotte would begin on January 2021. All funds will be ring fenced in a separate account with Charlotte able to oversee it and report to people on it's status.    Charlotte has helped so many people over the years  be it via welfare advice  Foodbank parcels or just her writing. It's time we give something back and give her the chance she deserves.

Well  last April I caught coronavirus. This absolutely knocked hell out of my fitness and left me barely able to cycle a few kilometres at a time. Since then though I've made a (nearly) full recovery and I want to push myself. This seems like a good challenge to me. I hope you agree!    This is the route.

I have been keeping these two jerseys to one day get framed and put them up on my wall. They mean a lot to me as anyone who knows football will know the magnitude of “that” game. During lockdown I made a decision to put them to a good cause and raise money for people who really need it most. I will always have the memories and with help from everyone we can hopefully raise a nice amount. Please donate or purchase a ticket. We can all play a little part so all donations are welcome but to enter its £15 for one ticket. No limit on tickets purchased.     Stay safe and healthy    Thank you    Billy xxx",True

We are so excited about the prospect of bringing this old Grade II listed building back to life! It was originally built in the early 1900’s as a Temperance Hall  since then it has had a plethora of uses  most recent of which left the building in a semi-derelict condition which included severe fire damage.    However  following its acquisition by The Tab Church  fresh ideas began to surface as to how it might be rescued  restored  and adapted to suit the needs for modern usage as Church  Community and Conferencing facility.    The ‘Tab1Milli’ is what will enable this most significant part of the Big Build project vision to become a reality  and the building actually able to be used.    But we can’t pull this off without your generous support because this is the largest financial project The Tab has ever undertaken.    We are therefore asking you to join with us through radical generosity  as together we step out in faith towards hitting the £1Million target by continually bringing our financial gifts together now and over the coming weeks and months.    Once the entire building is renovated  it will enable The Tab to continue and expand its traditional church functions and community initiatives  which are not limited to but currently include:  · Sunday services  · Kids church for children  · Crèche during the Sunday services  · Weekly prayer meetings  · Christian education and classes  · Administrative offices  · Bookshop/resources  · Food Bank – hosting Lewisham Central’s foodbank and distribution point. This is currently offered two-three times a week  staffed by 8-12 volunteers.  · Youth mentoring – support for vulnerable young people in the local community.  · Community action team (Restoration Empowerment and Community Help) – which focuses its support and resources on three vulnerable groups in Lewisham:  The elderly (offering days out and grocery food supplies);  The homeless (offering food clothing to those living on the streets)  and  Women and children escaping from domestic abuse (offering support).    *The Big Build Project includes the overall vision of Tabernacle Global Ministries and therefore maybe used for general purposes....",True

We have been operating since 2012 in London and became a charity in March 2020. Information about SWAN can be found on our website www.swanlondon.org. We run a foodbank and provide community support to many Refugee and migrant families in London. We have also been providing aid to refugees in Camp Moria since 2018 in partnership with Kitrinos Healthcare and Team Humanity who are both charities registered to work in Greece. We have collected  sent (via container) and provided vital humanitarian aid to Refugees in Moria camp including food parcels  baby milk  nappies  clothes  shoes and blankets and documented the distributions on social media (WhatsApp). Team Humanity are our implementing partner on the ground and they have distributed regular food parcels to new arrivals on our behalf. In recent months there has been a dramatic increase in the number of new arrivals and conditions are horrendous. Many families are living in inhumane conditions with little or new food. Since November 2019 SWAN - with the help of TEAM HUMANITY has been providing bread (which is prepared by Refugees) in the camp to starving refugees in and outside Moria Camp. The cost of preparing each bread is 40 cents. €400 provides 1000 breads. There are currently 21 000+ refugees in Moria and many new arrivals have no funds and the queues are so long for the food provided by the Greek authorities and local charities that many get nothing. All funds received for this campaign will be sent to our implementing partner Team Humanity to pay for preparation and distribution of the bread. The ground team send pictures of each distribution to SWAN which we share with donors for transparency. The bread we distribute is often all they will eat. SWAN aim to provide bread three times a week - £1200. If we could do more we would. But we are a small charity dependent on your support. Please give generously and help us  help and feed them.",True

We thought lets get some sort of pizza and treat night delivery going on a Friday night for some families  however we are with the current restrictions finding it tough to stay afloat too and estimate we could probably only feed 6 or 7 families ourselves every week  but we know there's alot more poverty striken families than that  so with that in mind we thought if we can call on the amazing generosity and support of our amazing city  customers  friends and family to donate something  anything to help give these kids something to look forward to on a Friday night other than a foodbank meal we would be so grateful. We will put our chefs to work to make the food fresh and have delivery drivers delivering across the city to put a little smile on children's faces who would normally go without these things that we all take for granted. As Liverpool is renowned looking after their own lets make this happen! We will commit every week to this scheme .... and we will be working with various local charities who have vulnerable families on there books .... All funds raised will go towards ingredients only not our utility costs or petrol costs we will cover that as well as 7 families ourselves every week     Thank you for your support    Veggie Republic",True

In 2012  a member of LBUCC  and our friend Tom Hardman  passed away from an unidentified heart condition. Every year  there is a charity event in memory of Tom to raise money for Cardiac Risk in the Young  however this event was cancelled due to COVID-19.

On our school runs we’ve sadly noticed a lot of discarded face masks on the pavements and lots of other litter in our parkS as it’s being used a lot more in these times.     The team are going to spend the afternoon litter picking in aid of cleaning our local area and hopefully raising some money for our team.

Designed to look like miniature highly detailed East London style stores complete with lights  to be placed on a selection of fences in Waltham Forest.       The Artist Sean Rodrigo has previously decorated a Tiny Street Library in Walthamstow as a hand painted Edwardian home  and also completed a community project called The Mini Morris Project connecting the children of E17 with 500 free paintable hand-cast plaster sculpture kits of William Morris.     The boxes will serve as a donation point for canned food  where members can donate or talk cans from the box when they need it  and also for the food bank charity to pickup when the boxes are full.     Food banks are currently very busy as people are being hit hard by work instability caused by COVID 19. PL84U Al Suffa Food bank’s mission is to Serve the community of the Elderly  Homeless and those ‘In need’ people of faith and non-faith groups who are living in conditions of social-economic  cultural deprivation and isolation. Providing a free meal and friendly environment for the elderly people in need & homeless in east London. They offer weekly fresh quality foodbank sessions for shopping for families and individuals.    For more information or to donate directly please visit www.pl84u-alsuffa.org        We hope these boxes give people an approachable way to get food without the stigma of visiting a food bank and also as a way to enrich the streets with a beautiful new mini landmark.     The intention is to cover the cost of building the boxes  paint  lights  tools and 3D printing material for 7 boxes     UPDATE - We are extending the project to add functionality to the boxes to allow the charity to be notified when the boxes are full and ready for pickup.",True

50","Seeing as there is absolutely nothing of interest happening on the 31/01/2020  what better time to shine a light on the good work of the Trussell Trust?     On Friday 31st January  over on our Twitter account @Canned_Aid and using the hashtag #CannedAid  we will be highlighting the incredible work the Trussell do  along with inviting others to share their stories of how charity has changed lives across the UK.     We'll be sharing this crowdfunder up to the evening  then join us online between 6pm - Midnight for a massive push for funds - and hopefully some fun too  linking up people across the Twittersphere and UK.     Lets build on our networks over the past few years  gain back some headline-space with a show of generosity and raise some money for this invaluable nationwide network of foodbanks.     @Canned_Aid   #CannedAid",True

London may not be having a marathon this year  but Didsbury will! Not only that but  collectively  the residents plan on beating the current ""official"" world record of just over 2 hours while also adhering to strict social distancing measures!    We'd love your support. Please sponsor/donate what ever you can  all monies raised will go directly to Burnage Foodbank.    Here's how we will ensure Social Distancing:    This event is for residents only. Unfortunately non residents will not be able to spectate as there is no where to put them while ensuring social distancing.    Key points - Warm up (outside YOUR OWN) house from 9:45am    1st leg starts 10am – Participants will be notified of their group and approx. start time by Whats app!    The race will follow VERY STRICT SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES  to do this we really need all cars etc to be off the road by 9am on Sunday 26th so the road can be used as the course. We appreciate this can be tricky especially where homes have more than one car. To help  we have contacted The Parrswood Pub to see if we could perhaps park in their car park. If this is something that may be of interest/use to you  please let me know so I can confirm details.    Participants be they  Walking/Jogging or Running will start outside their own house (level with their left fence post) they will step onto the road/the course and will then will travel in an anti-clockwise direction  going down one side then up the other. Their lap (s) will finish when they return to their house. This will mean people are kept safe and social distancing will be adhered to at all times! Partipants will use the outside of the road allowing a 2m gap between them and runners running on the other side of the road.     Participants  participate at their own risk.     The footpath will act as a barrier between runners and those spectating/supporting from their drive. Supporters  please ensure you are a minimum of 2meters away from where participants will be passing ie. A minimum of 2 meters from the curb.    3 or 4 people (or in some cases 3 couples or 3 families will participate at the same time) participants will be in groups (allowing for social distancing) and will be given a start time. 1 lap is 451 meters so this will more than allow for social distancing between each participant/houshold. Those running with children under 10  should hold their hand when participating to prevent trips/falls and ensure they don’t jeopardise social distancing measures.    Participants will be categorised (by themselves) into Walkers/Potterers ie. Joggers with kids under 10years  Joggers and Runners and will participate (at their allocated slot) with others in the same category. Overtaking shouldn’t be an issue anyway but to be clear  participants will NOT be allowed to overtake!    Any questions please ask.",True

As many of you will know  they organised a fair last year in aid of Gateshead Foodbank. They went round every shop in the Metro Centre  Newcastle City Centre and many many local shops and businesses asking for raffle and tombolas prizes as well as items to auction. They organised games and everything was ready to go for 5th April 2020  then the first LOCKDOWN happened. They donated all food and perishable items to Gateshead Foodbank in November and we have all other donations stored safely in our house ready for when we are allowed to hold a fair.     The girls were absolutely devastated that they couldn't raise money last year and we had hoped that we might have been able to hold the fair this Easter  although sadly we don't think this will happen.   Because if this  they have decided that they want to challenge themselves this lockdown and get sponsored to do so!  GRACE wants to do 2000 cartwheels before Lockdown ends!   TILLY wants to try and learn all the times tables up to 12 X 12!

Mum was a generous  caring and selfless person who worked tirelessly for social justice. She was devoted to her family and large circle of friends and loved bringing people together. As a Labour councillor for 33 years she dedicated her time to helping and serving others and represented the ward she was born in  and lived in  all her life. Mum was so proud of this role and of her community.  We have set up this page to raise funds in her memory and will share the proceeds equally between three local charities which meant a lot to mum and who are working on the frontline to help disadvantaged people in challenging circumstances. These are; the S2 Foodbank where mum was a regular helper  St Wilfrids Centre which provides support for homeless people and ASSIST Sheffield who help destitute asylum seekers.   Thank you for your support.",True

The knock on effect of lockdowns will see many struggling to earn enough to cover basic needs. While also being stuck at home through winter  sometimes it's a choice between eating or heating.    Access to food banks can be a lifeline to people when they most need it.    While we at Brixton Music Community celebrate the possibility of nightlife returning soon  we also see the chance to go out and dance to music as a privilege that people shouldn't take for granted.    So for the last leg of lockdown  on 12/03/21 from 12pm we are broadcasting a 24 hour music marathon from Larry Sun to keep people staying in doing the right thing  while hopefully raising some money to get mouths fed and bellies full.

The individual /individuals have taken tablets that were used for referrals to the fuel bank to enable those in crisis to receive an emergency payment and for a nationwide surveys into foodbank from Edinburgh university. They have taken our main hard drive /pc all are password protected . They have obviously ransacked the office and damaged our filing cabinets. Along side the items we need to replace   they have taken around £200 that was donated over the Christmas period which obviously provides much needed funds for the day to day running of the foodbank. Food was taken too  so we are putting an appeal out for tinned fish  rice pudding  tinned fish   tinned tomatoes and uht milk.   We as a charity can little afford the extra costs incurred to replace the more valuable items and office furniture. Any donations will be greatly received and used to help to wider community .      As stated our original target was £1000 and we have blown away by the generosity of the wider public. I am one of the merry band of volunteers at Oldham Foodbank. We offer assistance to those in crisis with food parcels for 3 days . As we have smashed our target   extra money raised will be used to enhance our current security systems to prevent ourselves from being targeted again . Furthermore the money raised will secure day to day expenses of the Foodbank for the foreseeable future   enabling us to continue to provide to those in need and crisis.   All monies raised is to be transferred to Oldham Foodbank bank account which is run by our Trustees.     Update on 17/5/19     We are in the process of withdrawing funds   The funds will be withdrawn via the manager of the Foodbank and promptly transferred to the Oldham Foodbank account which the Trustees will be able to allocate funds as we require them .   Once again Thank you   a photo showing the transfer and statement will be placed via this page for transparency.     ",True

In the meantime the government intervened and the free school dinner row has made us realise that we need to be making food available now. While we still set up the shop we will be opening to distribute any food we can get. We hope in the next few weeks to use The Institute in Ottery St Mary as a proper community resource to make sure that no one in Ottery goes hungry.        It seems a lifetime ago that we first heard of Covid-19 but it is sometimes hard to believe it has only been a few short months. Back at the start of March a local Ottery St Mary resident floated an idea on social media. Her idea was to create a volunteer team to help the “at risk”  elderly  self-isolating and key workers in our community.     From that seed of an idea  in one week over 400 local residents signed up to join and selflessly come to the aid of those around them. Ottery Community Volunteers (OCV) became a reality. Now a unregistered Not for Profit organisation the group has already mobilised to provide vital support to the local community.     What is the purpose of the group?     OCV have three key objectives:     • To establish and sustain for an extended time  a volunteer force capable of supporting our community.     • To minimise the transmission and infection rates of Covid-19 by reducing the footfall within our community and supporting people in isolation.     • To maintain a robust and enduring volunteer operation for as long as is needed  resilient enough to support our community.     What are we actually doing for our community?     The volunteer network is already operational and working in our community. We have divided the volunteer network into priority areas:     Pharmacy Group – collecting and delivering prescriptions for the target people.     Deliveries Team – focused on doing shopping for food & essential supplies  delivered to homes for those self-isolating & vulnerable  reducing the footfall of people in town.     Befriending Group – working alongside the Ottery Help Scheme we offer befriending telephone support for those in need of someone to talk to during their isolation    Foodbank Team – Our volunteers also work with Ottery Foodbank  supporting their essential efforts.    Mental health wellbeing service to our volunteers  run by volunteer healthcare professionals.    Finance team - Using prepaid cards to minimise the use of cash and the risks for transmission of Covid-19  as well as ensuring robust financial accountability.    Why are we fund raising?     Whilst OCV has already started work  up until this point we have relied upon a great deal of good will from volunteers and businesses. In order for us to offer a safe  sustainable  efficient and professional service for our local community we need funding. We recognise that there will be a requirement for active community support for many months to come. We will be using the funds raised to cover a wide range of budgeted costs including:     • Safeguarding training including Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks for volunteers     • Insurance    • Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)     • Volunteer out of pockets expenses including mileage claims     • Stationery & consumables    • Software licences     • Printing and postage    • Staffing & resources    Thank you.",True

Every year  Droitwich Spa High School and Sixth Form puts on a school-wide Charities Week in order to raise money for a local charity.    However  this year has been different for everybody  and as a result we’ve decided to showcase our events virtually  for free. This allows all students  parents and members of the local community to access the content for some light-hearted entertainment during a difficult time for us all.    The time and effort put in to film and edit these events  both from students and members of staff  has been incredible  and we hope that their effort will be rewarded by your enjoyment and positive feedback  and by being able to raise money for an excellent cause.    All money raised will go directly to the Droitwich Spa Foodbank  who work hard to feed the most vulnerable members of our community. All donations  regardless of size  are hugely appreciated  and could have a larger impact on those who are less fortunate than us. For parents of students  there is also a donation option on the school’s ParentPay system  if you would prefer to make a donation this way.

On 23rd March 2020 we initiated a city-wide response bringing together 24 local grassroots and small community-based projects from across the city  with Senior Managers from Dundee City Council and Dundee Volunteer and Voluntary Action. We facilitate weekly Zoom meetings with this group  now the Food Insecurity Network  which allows us to hear what our communities are struggling with  tailor the support to the local projects and ensure the Council responds in an informed and relevant way. These projects are rooted in their local communities and are the key food providers responding to food emergency and insecurity.    For the last 9 months these projects have been working tirelessly  providing food for 2-3 000 people each week. These are our neighbours  our friends  our family. As we move into our second lockdown in the middle of winter when bills are already higher  staying at home will push more people over the edge and plunge them into poverty.     The Scottish Government  Dundee City Council and local Charitable trusts have all contributed to the cost of food being distributed. But the local projects still need to purchase more food every week to ensure there is enough for each person they see.     Any funds donated will go directly to the projects to help them buy food or additional items  such as toiletries  cleaning products  face masks and hand gel. Any donation  no matter how small  will be gratefully received      The projects involved in the Food Insecurity Network:     Kirkton Community Larder  St Marys Community Larder  Lochee Community larder  Dundee TheGither  Taught by Muhammad Foodbank  The Friary  The Salvation Army  Menzieshill Church  St Lukes Church  St Marys RC Church  The Community Fridge   Lochee Hub  Making Dundee Home   Coldside Community Cupboard  Hilltown Larder  Parish Nursing   Eagles Wings  Boomerang Community Centre  Rock Solid Community Larder  Fintry Parish Church  Lifegate Church  Link-up Whitfield  Chalmers Ardler Food Larder  Charleston and Lochee Churches Food provision    The Network works closely with Dundee Foodbank to ensure there is a coordinated approach across the city.

We have a process in place to make sure all funds donated to the group are spent on current community projects and future legacy projects which are in the best interest of the residents of Nailsea. Any spending is reviewed and voted on before being approved by the Nailsea Community Group Management Team.

Community Larder - this has been established to stop food from going to waste and is supported by local shops  both independently and through the charities FareShare  Neighbourly  and FoodShare. It has an average of 55 visits a day and is open to all residents and has no impact on our Foodbank stock. #feedbelliesnotbins       Community Food Club - this is open to those who receive benefits. Membership costs £1 per household and entitles members to a weekly bag of store-cupboard items worth over £10 for £3.50.        End Holiday Hunger - When schools are not running we are endeavouring to provide food for every child in Nailsea who receives Free School Meals in term time.      Nailsea Active - this initiative continues to inspire people to stay mentally and physically active and to make the most of our amazing local facilities.

Personllay I feel ensuring that foodbanks have adequate food to help the most vulnerable in our community is a priority.     There are 5 foodbanks in my local area which last year issued 64.1 tonnes of food  the equivalent of 128 000 packs of 500g bags of pasta. They feed 7 669 clients of which 3 065 are children.    My Challenge:  I am a keen cyclist and due to Covid-19 outbreak my usual social and competitive cycles have been impacted. So to keep motivated I am going to attempt to complete 10 back to back training sessions all from my virtual trainer.    To complete the training sessions I will use a virtual app called Sufferfest   which as the name suggests is a festival of suffering. On a normal day one session is tough so completing 10 back to back will be challenging.

This year  everything is a bit different.     We would like to give people needing the foodbank a gift voucher to use just as they wish. To buy something they really need. And especially for parents - to be able to buy the gifts that their kids are wishing for.     Do you want to help? Rather than donating a wrapped gift this year  please contribute to our campaign. We will use all money raised to buy gift vouchers from Argos and B&M  and distribute these to people using the foodbank in time for Christmas. We would love your support!

industry  from editors  booksellers and authors  to publicists  agents and designers  are donating money to go towards helping the acute crisis in poverty and hunger amongst the least well off in the country.    We live in a nation where more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. The Trussell Trust has given out over 1.6 million packs of food supplies in the past year alone. Food Banks are not just a place to pick up essential sustenance  with cuts to community centres and frontline services they have also become mini-welfare and advice centres.    We're aiming to raise £5000 before Christmas 2019  which will go to the Trussell Trust. Your donation will directly help those most in need of support. It is vital that those working in publishing come together as a community and take action.    It is important to help those in greatest need but solutions must also be found to the reasons people find themselves in need of food banks.    The Trussell Trust’s CEO Emma Revie has indicated that the benefits system has been driving a rise in foodbank use– the charity released their State of Hunger 2019 report in November.    “This is the busiest six months we’ve ever seen – more people than ever before are being forced to foodbanks’ doors ” said Revie. “Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty  but currently thousands of women  men and children are not receiving sufficient protection from destitution. This is not right. But we know this situation can be fixed – our benefits system could be the key to unlocking people from poverty. We need to put money back into the pockets of people who most need our support. It’s in our power as a country to end the need for foodbanks. This can change.”        Thank you for your support.

Rather than let good food go to waste we are working with The Street team Tunbridge Wells & Nourish Community Foodbank to supply cooked food to homeless people in Tunbridge Wells including Christmas Day and to raise vital funds for Nourish moving forwards  this will also enable us to cover some costs of running our business to keep it alive while supporting those in need.     We plan to use our contacts within the food trade to ensure that trade prices are achieved rather than paying high street costs We have set this page up to help with covering some the costs of cooking the food  anything above that will be donated.

We value all our supporters who make a big difference. We provide three days’ emergency food and support to local families and people in crisis.     Covid19 is impacting Rhondda Foodbank in the following ways:    1. Increased demand across the Rhondda with prospects of getting worse.    2. Reduction in food donations because of the change in shopping habits.    3. Self-isolation of some of our regular volunteers.

The initiative is focussed on activities that benefit the community within Blackpool and the surrounding area.    Over the last few weeks  Brothers Helping Hands has been joining in with the community spirit in COVID-19 relief and support by providing lunches for all care home workers in Blackpool and thus far has provided 400 lunches across TWENTY-SIX homes in the area. We have also donated over 1 100 food items such as fresh salads  coleslaws and pastas to various foodbanks in Blackpool & the Fylde to support the vulnerable  homeless and elderly.    The Initiative has also provided ""Thank You"" drops in to all Emergency Service Stations in Blackpool and Fleetwood  with a further drop planned for Lytham over the next few days.    While we are entirely grateful to a number of organisations; namely the Greencore Group for their regular food donations  Fox's Biscuits for their substantial donations and The Gallant Pioneer for free use of their premises to run the operation from  the current levels of expenditure for accompanying food in the ""Lunches for Carers"" packs is unsustainable for the group.    The Lodge is now launching this fundraising effort to help us to continue our work  to complete our lunches for carers during the COVID-19 pandemic and ringfence funds for further potential relief in the town such as to obtain PPE for free distribution and further support to all those on the front line.    All funds will be used only by the Brothers Helping Hands initiative and if required will be ringfenced for future projects lead by the Brothers Helping Hands initiative.    The Lodge is entirely grateful to all donations no matter how small  and greatly appreciates the support of all those who wish this initiative every success for the benefit of the wider community in Blackpool & the Fylde coast.",True

For the swim I will be tethered so will be static... think of it as 1.5 hours of front crawl but never being able to reach the end of the pool    I am starting at 7am and hope to finish my 7pm!    Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to me. So far I have raised around £400 via Facebook and PayPal but know a few people have had some issues with these platforms so have brought it together here    More information about Malmesbury and District Foodbank: Malmesbury and District Foodbank provides emergency food parcels to those in food poverty. We rely entirely on donations  grants and gifts and are a registered charity and part of the Trussell Trust network of nationwide foodbanks ",True

At this time of year Preen usually receives hundreds of Harvest Festival food donations from local schools and churches. Local people are extremely generous and Harvest Festival alone provides enough food to feed everyone at the food bank until Christmas. This year  because of rules on gatherings (and the transmission risks involved with handling and sharing goods)  most of these collections won’t take place. This means Preen will not be able to rely on the 5+tonnes of food it usually receives and will struggle to help people who really  really need a hand. Since lockdown  the majority of people Preen has helped have either lost their job  their self employed work or have been furloughed. Many of them have never claimed benefits or used a food bank before. Preen is the only local foodbank where people can drop in without a referral. And families get the help they need for as long as they need it  until they get back on their feet. If you normally donate a few tins to a Harvest collection and could instead spare a couple of quid for Preen to buy food  toiletries and other emergency items it would help so much. They will need more than I can raise alone but anything you give will help somebody. Thank you so much. There’s info about Preen’s foodbank and furniture bank at www.preenreuse.com. ",True

Can I tell you a little story?    Once upon a time there was a radio station. This was no ordinary radio station. It was special. It was only small but it made a huge impact on everyone that lived in the community.     Now when you think of a radio station you might think it’s just a place that plays music. This is true  it did play music  but it also did so much more. The reason why it was so special is because it created connections. It made everyone feel like part of the family and really cared. It included everybody  not a soul was left out.     The little station helped everyone in the community as best it could. When singers wanted to sing  it showcased their talents  when local events took place  it promoted them  when charities needed help  it supported them. It helped everyone  but most of all it was a friend  a friend that was always there no matter what time of day.    On a dark dreary day  it was announced the station was to be sold to a big  hairy monster. The community was devastated. The elderly were isolated  the people felt alone and disconnected from one another and the rest of the world.    ‘What a rotten story!’ I hear you cry. I agree. It’s pretty rubbish  but it’s a true story.    I live in the smallest County in England – Rutland. I worked at the special station that was unfortunately taken over by the hairy monster in question. However  I have been inundated with requests to start a new station… Can you help me?        The station was a friend to so many people  but it also helped a heap of charities. It promoted the foodbanks so those in need can get access  it promoted the Good and New Clothes Sale  which funded the Citizen’s Advice Bureau in Oakham  it promoted Second Helpings so we can reduce our food waste and feed bellies instead  it promoted Mindspace Stamford so we can connect with our fellow human beings through art and reading classes. It supported our small businesses encouraging people to shop local with shop Stamford and Oakham.       Please give this story a happy ending by donating on this go fund me page. Anything will be appreciated.    Thank you    Jennifer x     How you can help:  1. Donate. It doesn’t have to be a large amount  anything will help.  2. Help me form a team so that I am not doing this alone.   3. Spread the word  by word of mouth or share on FB and Twitter  4. Help me get this on TV. ",True

Each player will be covering just over 16 miles from Wednesday to Wednesday. Judging by player fitness during the season  this might be a struggle  especially with a few of the lads taking it easy during quarantine. We'll all chop a freezing pint at the end of our final run just to add to the fun .     We would really appreciate any donation towards our campaign which is going to a brilliant cause.

My wife Sheila  who lost her life to secondary Breast Cancer 3 years ago is my inspiration for “The Derek Welsh 1000 Bike Ride.     To remember her  who was the love of my life for 41 years  a love that will always be a part of me. She captivated my heart on the first day I saw her  it was then she showed me that love requires sacrifice  that without sacrifice for others  it is not love.  She lived her life quietly doing what she did  and by this she has inspired me by her actions towards others.  Sheila’s life revolved around considering others  seeking to enable them by the support she gave  first at home  and then in her work outside the home  she was a pioneer  a trailblazer  traveling to Boston in Massachusetts from her home village of Hendy in Carmarthenshire  in 1972; traveling to the other side of the world  where she lived and worked in Boston for 4 years as a companion for the grandmother of a large family  when she was 19 years old.     Sheila lived quietly  except when it came to standing up for the adults with special additional needs that she cared for in her day to day work; then Sheila could be very vocal  and would bravely stand up to anyone and everyone when necessary  in order that they would do what is right. I will always remember Sheila’s massive heart in caring for others  as throughout her life she showed me what love is.       The bike ride will give me a focus as I still struggle to come to terms with her being taken three years ago  it will help me to get fit and stay fit  and also to continue doing what she always did by caring for others.     There are two particular causes on my heart for which I seek to raise money  whilst at the same time  staying fit  raising awareness  and promoting caring for others.    Half of the donated money raised will go to Maggies 'Everyone's Home of Cancer Care'  Maggies in Swansea  was a little heaven every time we went together as we received support through Sheila’s journey of living with cancer.     And  the other half (to a new project also close to my heart  and which was close to hers) to help fund;    JB Learning Academy Ltd (James & Bradley)        JB Learning Academy Ltd will run practical workshops  which teach adults and children with special and additional needs practical life skills in a working environment. My experience is that these people so wish to learn  and flourish  but face so many additional challenges than most of us.     J&B are two young men with additional needs that I currently work with and have both been an inspiration to my wife Sheila & I on our life journey together.     ""Derek's Welsh 1000."" is a cycle ride around Wales  and also a ride from South to North Wales  it will cover Just over 1000 miles and will be done in stages  this will be over a two month period which will include a two week period of concentrated cycling with overnight stops around the coastline. The south to North ride on the Lon Las Cymru  will also be done over a week  with overnight stops.    The stages will start on the week ending 30th May 2021 which was Sheila’s birthday. I would welcome people to join me on different parts of the journey as social distancing allows.    I have subscribed to Mapometer and have got as far as mapping and saving the coast routes  which hug the coastline. I am now working on the breakdown of the Lon Las Cymru route before finalising the dates and order of the ride     Recently I bought a new touring bike -“Ortler Bergerac  and also had my Dawes bike restored at “Krankz” in Llanelli. Phil also did a couple of adjustments on the Ortler Bergerac before my first time out on it. I highly recommend the Krankz husband and wife team  Phil and Natasha in Llanelli  and if you live within the areas they cover  then I ask you to support Kranz www.krankz.co.uk  They have supported me in so many ways  as their hearts were to help me set this page up  and are supporting me ongoing.    JB Learning Academy Ltd (for James & Bradley)    “J” stands for - James  he is a young man who spends all his time outside his house in a wheelchair  and whose prospects for his life  is just sitting around doing very little  whilst being disconnected from the world outside his house. He is blind and also has other difficulties that he has to deal with not least of which is the apathy that our society has towards him in just accepting this situation as being ok.     James has been an inspiration to me  particularly since Sheila died  and I get far more back from him than I give him; he loves to learn new things and is like a sponge  and I love that I can enable him to learn and to do things through the support that I give.    I have worked with James for over 8 years off and on  and daily for over 5 years.     James is learning Welsh with a Lancastrian accent as I speak to him in welsh with my own Lancastrian accent.     I speak the words first in welsh and then speak the same words in English and James is learning by repetition  he loves to use what he has learnt and as he does so he is teaching others. His family do not speak Welsh  but they are learning because James has taken home what he has learnt.   He has also learnt about food hygiene  and has a Food Hygiene Certificate  and is now able to legally go into the Coleshill Centre's main kitchen to assist in food preparation. Jan the cook at Coleshill and the rest of the staff had welcomed him in with open arms and he was a real asset  up until lockdown last March. James was also signed up to do some NVQ units in food preparation by Sharon  our local NVQ assessor.     James will be an asset in teaching others and will be an example to others who want to learn  he is polite and is quoted as saying he does not have favorites.    “B” is for - Bradley  a young man living with Autism and lives with health issues  and has been in my life for 10 years.   In all that time he has expressed a desire to want to work  his prospects however are much the same as James  because he needs a certain level of support in order to work  at least at the start  after which Bradley can be left to get on with his own workload. I would say that Bradley would brighten any work environment as he is sociable  hard working  and willing  and has always shown himself to be reliable in both his work placements and in the voluntary work that he has done  he has good concentration levels when working and once he starts something he wants to finish it  he is most certainly not a quitter.     Bradley has been on a number of Job experience placements and in every one of them he excelled at what he was asked to do  he has good concentration levels when working and once he starts something he wants to finish it  but despite this he has been disappointed on a number of occasions with his work placements  having been promised a job at the end  he has then been let down.  Bradley has good computer skills  and did Tourism and admin at college  and has certificates in his core subjects  and has his own unique skill set.Bradley has volunteered for a couple of years at a foodbank in Brynamman  and at the National trust in Llandeilo where he is part of the tour guide team. He has completed a peer mentoring certificate and has a care and concern for others which is quite inspirational.    Bradley changes the whole dynamic of a place when he is there  he has the ability to draw others in and include them  he is an articulate young man and a joy to be around and has much to offer as we start to set up this new learning academy.   Both Bradley and James will be supported to sit on the steering group of the learning academy as representatives of their peers  a group that will lead and guide the learning academy's development and will therefore be a big part of that development.    Our current system with its dwindling resources is now more disabling than it is enabling  and there is very little realistic expectation of progression in the support that is offered. It would appear that we are just spending millions of pounds supporting people to do nothing  and so the system is therefore not fit for purpose.     Though there are so many able and caring people working within the system  yet they work under so many restrictions that they are in fact working with their hands tied.     The focus is on cost cutting and therefore is not person centered which the law says it is meant to be.    The majority of the people I have been in contact with and have supported  want to be doing something real and with the right support and encouragement there is no reason why they can't.    Thank you reading my story  and my reasons for fundraising. I would be so grateful if you could donate any amount you find comfortable  and if you can't donate money  and you are local to me perhaps you could volunteer your time instead???

We would like to ask you to join us in helping to provide essential food parcels for vulnerable families in Medellin.     Many families are facing serious hardship and do not have the basic necessities due to the current government enforced lockdown.     People are struggling to buy food and have no income.     The current measures here mean that for many people it is impossible to work at the moment. Here there is not a support system in place to help people who cannot work or feed their families  or buy medicine.     We are deeply concerned for the welfare of the families that we work with  the children that we teach English to and the mothers that we spend Wednesday afternoons with in our women’s programme – as well as many other families that at the moment are in a really desperate position.     The lockdown has already lasted a month and the future is uncertain.     Huellas (Footprints)  the foundation we volunteer with are receiving donations and working with the city’s foodbank to deliver food parcels directly those most in need. Huellas have been operating for 10+ years and know the needs of the local area and families (a number of the volunteers live in the area too). They are so dedicated and the team’s response to the crisis has been amazing – finding innovative ways to educate the community to stop the spread of Covid-19 and providing food parcels.     Please help them continue supporting some of the most vulnerable families in the city and we can make sure that the children and mothers we work with  and the wider community  have food. If you have had the chance to visit Colombia  or know Colombians  you will know what warm  generous and kind-hearted people they are  and right now they really need some support.     We know that this is an incredibly difficult and uncertain time for everybody and that lots of people are already supporting charities that they care about. We are so lucky in the UK to have the NHS and a social welfare system that we can use. Many of these families have nothing and for most of us  the difficulties they are facing are unimaginable. You could really make a difference.     All of the money collected goes directly to the foundation who support the families directly by providing basic food supplies. As little as £5 could really help.     Please do donate if you can... and check out our instagram page to see what we have been up to!     https://www.instagram.com/somosfundacionhuellas/",True

If you've been following the news  you'll probably be aware that this winter is going to be a very hard one for some of the most vulnerable groups in society. Footballer Marcus Rashford has been in the headlines many times over the past few months for his campaign urging the Government to provide free school meals for children in poverty.     Unfortunately  many families  including a high proportion of ISHA residents and frontline workers  rely heavily on free school meals to make ends meet and keep their children from going hungry.     Obviously  things are tough for a lot of us this year  but it's important to help where we can. Customer service team member Akello Thomas suggested a foodbank collection. With the recent report from the Trussell Trust publicising that there was a 61% increase in demand this year  and the likelihood of increased struggles over Christmas  ISHA have decided to launch a Food Poverty Fundraiser.     How we can help  Please donate whatever you can to this GoFundMe  and our final financial contribution will be matched by ISHA. All money raised will go towards food and provisions to supply three local foodbanks in ISHA boroughs: Hackney Foodbank  Islington Foodbank  and Waltham Forest Foodbank (‘Eat or Heat’). These foodbanks provide a three-day emergency food supply and support to those in crisis. Together  they have supported thousands of people in need  and have become pillars of the local communities.    In addition to the PayPal donations  we have put baskets in the office for those of you working here - please refer to the poster below from Hackney foodbank to see what specific items they are in need of this month.     There are many ways to help people living in food poverty. We have chosen to donate to these foodbanks as we regularly refer our residents to these organisations.

Foodbanks  in particular  are being hit very hard during these days of panic buying so I'm looking to raise funds for both the Sunderland East End & Newcastle West End Foodbanks. The story about the Egg  it had been £550 and was on display in Fenwicks Newcastle  made by Charbonnel et Walker  one of Britain’s first and finest chocolatiers. It stands at about 500mm tall and has a circumference of about 1m. It's a mountain of some of the best chocolate in the world. Due to the Covid-19 virus  Fenwicks (a Newcastle institution) had announced it was closing down during this period for the safety of both its staff and customers  as a consequence it was also reducing all of its easter products. So how do I have it and what's the plan?     Having literally called in for something for my dinner that evening  then wondering why the food hall was so busy? I noticed in both the chaos and panic buying the easter products at discounted prices.     I also noticed this mother of all Easter Eggs Big Bertha (one of the biggest Easter Eggs in the Country) and its discounted price. Bargain  but there was no way I could eat it all but could there be a way that we could feed many more from this opportunity and some good news could come from both of these situations... I then cracked open a plan. Make a donation  I have set a minimum donation of £1 but you can donate whatever amount you like. You can make multiple donations to increase your chances or just be a kind person and make one. A name will be drawn at random by BBC Radio Newcastle either on the day Fenwicks reopens it doors or by the 8th April at the latest  in time for it to be delivered for Easter.     Let's make this a good news story for everyone as sharing is the new caring. Thanks for your support   Ian ",True

That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks  supported by The Trussell Trust  working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.    ABOUT OUR FOODBANK  An introduction to the Morecambe Bay Foodbank project.  Morecambe Bay Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. It began life at the GYM Church on Green Street in Morecambe and has now moved to The West End Community Centre on Westminster Road in Morecambe. We receive and distribute over six tonnes of food each month and our operation has been growing since its inception in 2012.     We have a small staff team led by our Foodbank Manager  Annette Smith  and over eighty regular volunteers who give up their time to help us each week.    ABOUT  HOW FOODBANKS WORK  Providing emergency food to people in crisis.  Every day people in the UK go hungry for reasons ranging from redundancy to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems.    FOOD IS DONATED  Schools  churches  businesses and individuals donate non-perishable  in-date food to a foodbank. Large collections often take place as part of Harvest Festival celebrations and food is also collected at supermarkets.    FOOD IS SORTED AND STORED  Volunteers sort food to check that it’s in date and pack it into boxes ready to be given to people in need. Over 40 000 people give up their time to volunteer at foodbanks.    PROFESSIONALS IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN NEED  Foodbanks partner with a wide range of care professionals such as doctors  health visitors  social workers and police to identify people in crisis and issue them with a foodbank voucher.    CLIENTS RECEIVE FOOD  Foodbank clients bring their voucher to a foodbank centre where it can be redeemed for three days’ emergency food. Volunteers meet clients over a warm drink or free hot meal and are able to signpost people to agencies able to solve the longer-term problem.",True

The Yellow-Lighted Bookshop provides reading lists for local schools and is the perfect partner to help us with this project. The books are provided by them at a substantial discount and we really are very appreciative of their involvement with this project.     The books promote reading skills and are wonderful to read  stories to engage and fire imagination  perfect for our young people.     In the current Coronavirus world our libraries have restricted use and even borrowing books from school libraries is more complicated. A new book is a treasure to a child! Our Nailsworth Rotary summer holiday book scheme was incredibly successful and it was clear to see the delight on the faces of those receiving them  this was especially for them  their own book to give hours of enjoyment. This may inspire them to explore more books  improve reading and writing skills and open up a whole world of possibilities and choices.     The books will be wrapped as Christmas Gifts from Nailsworth Rotary in environmentally friendly wrapping paper provided with the generous support of Brutons Home Hardware.     Egypt Mill Hotel and Restaurant has kindly agreed to accept and pass on envelopes which contain cash or cheques to Nailsworth Rotary  if you know people who do not have internet access but would like to donate to this scheme  please mention this optional avenue to them.

The Square Mile Food Bank has been set up with the support of Age UK London to assist residents in the City of London who are in need of essential food and provisions. The food bank is available to all local residents  regardless of age.     During the current Covid-19 pandemic  some food banks have closed and others are operating at reduced capacity. Many elderly and vulnerable residents are unable to rely upon their usual channels of support and many in the community have been affected financially due to the crisis and are unable to meet their basic daily needs. The Square Mile Food Bank is therefore a critical resource to ensure that those most in need can be provided with urgent  nutritious food supplies.    The food bank is volunteer led and relies solely on donations from members of the community  companies and other grant giving bodies. Any donation  large or small  will make a huge difference to ensure that we are able to reach as many people as need the service.

So  as a fitting tribute to Matt  we have decided against flowers for his funeral and if you wish to  a donation would be appreciated  as Matt would have approved of this  so much more than having flowers!

The children have been learning about their rights which are listed in a document called the UN Convention on The Rights of the Child  or UNCRC. They have recently been learning about Article 27  which states that every child has the right to an adequate standard of living that is good enough to meet their physical needs  their social needs and support their development. Whilst doing research in class  the children found that 2020 has seen a 62% increase in children in Scotland needing to be fed from food banks when compared with 2019.     The pupils have planned to do a Rights Run in school in December and in partnership with Coatbridge Community Foodbank have arranged for a food collection to take place.

Thank you in advance for your contribution to this gallant  local cause that means so much to so many.    ""We are truly delighted that the Speaker of Hackney has nominated us as his new Charity for the remainder of his Speakership. Now more than ever  we look to our community to support us in responding to the ever growing need among some of the most vulnerable people in Hackney. Whether it's through volunteering with us  donating food  donating money  or finding out more about the drivers of poverty  it all contributes towards essential support for vulnerable people in desperate situations  and helps shine a light on a situation that needs to change.     Prior to lockdown  Hackney Foodbank had observed a worrying trend in the growing demand for our services. The growth in demand was over 40% in 2018 versus 2017  and 52% in 2019 versus 2018. Truly worrying statistics.     But these previous levels of demand suddenly paled into insignificance when lockdown hit us earlier this year. In the first three months of lockdown alone  Hackney Foodbank served more people than we did in the entire year of 2018. That's over 5 600 mouths. Many of these people had been in paid work but were suddenly forced to stop overnight  with no safety net and no savings to tide them over. More than a quarter of the people relying on our emergency food parcels are children  and most of them are of primary school age.     Last year we fed over 8 300 people. In comparison  this year we have already fed over 13 300    We kept our centres open throughout the borough during lockdown  adapting to an at-the-door service so that we kept everyone as safe as possible in the face of the threat to safety posed by Covid 19. We will carry on serving people in need  giving them hope to carry on  and signposting them to other much-needed sources of support to help them out of the poverty trap.     We also continue our campaigning work  supported by the Trussell Trust  by gathering data and developing insights into the extent of poverty  and what can change to help tackle this growing issue.

A Benedictine Priory for nearly five hundred years  and then a parish church serving primarily the poor for just over three hundred years  the Cathedral now serves as the mother church of the Diocese of Swansea. It has a rich heritage that includes a gloriously carved medieval font  an arrow sharpening stone possibly used for the Agincourt campaign  and the regimental colours of the South Wales Borderers  including those from the battles of Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift. It is described in in the Pevsner Architectural Guide for Powys as ""pre-eminently the most splendid and dignified Church in Mid-Wales."" More importantly  Brecon Cathedral is a living community that continues the daily round of prayers  including Choral Evensong  and excellent worship while also serving the needs of the diocese  Brecon  and the world. We are actively involved in supporting the Brecon Foodbank and other charities  and in 2018 started the Convivium initiative to encourage thoughtful engagement between faith  heritage  and the environment. The Cathedral  however  faces serious financial problems. A medieval building is expensive to run and maintain. Even before COVID-19  the Dean and Chapter found it difficult to meet daily expenses. Additionally  the Cathedral roof is in increasingly poor condition and requires in the near future more than a million pounds worth of repairs. Thanks to COVID-19  the financial future of the Cathedral is now even worse thanks to the cancellation of services  concerts and other events.

As a result of the partnerships which have been made we have been able to supply food parcels for up to 100 families a week at times  this does not account for the number of people who come to collect food items at the church and these are separate to the Foodbank referrals. The contacts for the food parcels have come through various schools  individuals and other groups. We have also arranged the purchase and packing of around 50 fresh fruit and vegetable parcels for the local food bank each week. Since the start of Covid we have produced over 1250 food parcels between the Wokingham Community Hub  the Foodbank and direct contacts.    The majority of the items we have are donated however with the financial donations we receive we are able to put this back into the project and purchase items that we require. Share- Wokingham has been open daily to anyone who can come along to Norreys Church  offering bakery items and any other surplus food stock we have – there is no charge for this but if people are able to make a donation  however small  it is always appreciated. This means it does not carry the stigma attached to going to the Foodbank as people are not just being able to feed themselves for little to no money but they are also having an environmental impact in tackling the waste issue.    As the pandemic has continued the needs of those that we support have changed  initially it was people who were shielding and unable to get out and now we are really seeing the economic impact  job losses and financial woes have meant that people are struggling - that is where we can support.",True

I’m raising money for my local food bank  ‘Eat or Heat’ who run an invaluable service for our community’s most vulnerable residents. They also host community events to bring people together. I don’t want to be political but austerity has affected many of us and around 4 million children now live in poverty. Universal Credit is being rolled out in Waltham Forest this year leading to an inevitable rise in food bank use.Please donate so that the food bank can buy items that aren’t donated regularly - especially sanitary items as well as extending shelf space.Also  if you donate you can set me a challenge and I’ll try do it - please be nice!

This show is the culmination and celebration of years of study and creativity  and to lose it was a huge blow. Glasgow School of Art’s institutional response has been (at time of writing) sorely lacking.    A group of us affected students (and generous others) have made the DS2020 Simulator  a virtual recreation of our show that never happened  in its intended location of Glasgow’s Stow College.     We hope this can be the final celebration of our work we never really got  but in this case made by us  and accessible to everyone across barriers financial  medical  geographical and otherwise.

We want to provide care bags with toiletries & sweets for when they need a quick boost on the go. We are hearing how hot & busy it gets  so this simple gesture will make a difference and remind them that the public do care. Of course  the best thing we can all do to help them  is stay at home and fully-respect social distancing. But many of you want to do more to say thank you and every £ will help. We know money is extra-tight for some families at the moment  so please give what you can or if you can’t give  please share the GoFundMe with others. On this note  we would like to donate half the proceeds of this appeal to the Boston Foodbank (c/o reg charity 1138045 Parish of Boston)This is to help our health service with wider public health at this time  as people who can eat well are stronger and have better immune systems to fight off infection. Also feedback from some healthcare workers is that they really appreciate the public support  but feel well-paid. So they would like people to help those less well-off in our community.     Thank you and please help us not only reach our target ASAP  but also go beyond so we can provide more care packs  and also donate to other foodbanks in the Pilgrim catchment area if we smash our target!

Starting appropriately during Book Week Scotland  this is your chance to buy a book for a child for Christmas! Donate £10  gift aid it and the whole amount will go on buying a gift that really will go on giving.    This year  I'm raising money to buy books for babies and toddlers in families supported by Save the Children in Edinburgh and the Lothians. You can find out more about their work to mitigate the impact of poverty among children and families in Scotland here    Why Books for Christmas?    Well  we all know how important it is for children to get the best possible start in life  and the role that books and reading can play. My house is full of books  including favourites of my boys from when they were wee  and even some of my own childhood favourites which have been shared with them too.     When we didn't have much money  I relied on others to buy books - and we were regulars at the local library. Books were definitely a luxury and sadly  that's still the case for many families today. And these same families will be worrying about the cost of Christmas and how to give their children presents that last.    You can help change that.  I've set a much more modest target this year - £1000. If we reach it  it will buy books for at least 100 children. The more we raise  the more books we can buy.     And if you gift aid your donation  our funds will go even further. Every penny and pound you donate will be spent on buying books - I'll pay the charge for the fundraising.     So please do donate what you can.  And feel free to recommend books you think babies and toddlers (0-3) would like - or the ones your children or children you know liked when they were that age.     If you want to keep up with the campaign - and help spread the word! - follow @KidsBooksfrXmas on twitter (though I'll be tweeting from @burdzeyeview too).    Thank you - so much - for your support.     Kate    PS If you have children's (and adults!) books in good condition to give away  why not offer them to a local playgroup or see if your foodbank can use them.     And don't forget to recommend the books you think babies and toddlers would love to get for Christmas!    ",True

Two years ago at the age of 65 my friend and Grammy Award Winning Producer  Winston was diagnosed with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) Stage 3  a debilitating respiratory condition which can be managed with medication. His condition was made worse by a botched treatment while in hospital where his right lung was accidentally punctured (and while he was conscious) drastically impacting on his already worsening health. To compound matters he returned to find his home had been burgled and emptied. His treatment to date has cost him any savings he had. He has also suffered a stroke and been diagnosed with s hole in heart.    As a result of his condition Winston cannot work to afford his already astronomical medicine costs. Without financial assistance this will not end well for him. He is based in Jamaica  where there is no NHS  no foodbanks and no Welfare State to fall back on  and health insurance which he now cannot afford  only covers 5% of any costs.     This is literally a life or death fundraiser.    Winston has to use several different inhalers just to be able to keep his laboured breathing going  which is currently being impacted further by the stress and worry of not knowing from one month to the next  and at this time from one day to the next  if he will be able to continue to pay for his medicine  travel to hospital and his doctor  a roof over his head and basic food.    Winston is an amazing and generous person  and has made a massive contribution to the global music scene starting out as Bob Marley's road manager in 1979 and going on to work as a producer and promoter with Peter Tosh  Max Romeo  Black Uhuru  Maxi Priest  Jimmy Cliff  The Wailers and The Heptones  to name but a few  bringing music to the world. He is generous to a fault and helped so many people both professionally and personally throughout his life. Now Winston urgently needs your help.    The cost of his medication and treatment in Jamaica is astronomical. Part of his daily medication is the use of SIX inhalers and just one of these alone costs US$250 (£192) per month. Each day that goes by being unable to afford his treatment  basic food and shelter worsens his condition to the point where it could be fatal.    Please help Winston today  without your generosity he won't make it.

The Cumbernauld & Kilsyth Care team    ***UPDATE***    We currently have a large volume of referrals  including requests for mattresses and school blazers. We urgently need the funds to buy these items for families struggling to get these themselves. We have families who need cots with new mattresses for babies who have outgrown their moses baskets  and blazers for young people who are standing out from their peers because their families can't afford to buy a blazer that fits (we have appealed for pre-loved ones  but no luck yet).",True

There are only a handful of surgeons in the world who specialise in this field  with the only one in Europe based in Barcelona. This surgeon has diagnosed me remotely through taking a detailed clinical history and studying images from an upright MRI. Below  there is more information about what these conditions are and what they mean for me. The next step for me would be to follow the strong recommendations of the neurosurgeon and meet with him for a series of tests alongside a face-to-face consultation to determine the extent of the issue and how necessary/beneficial surgery would be. These tests are as follows: Cineradiology - Similar to a digital motion x-ray  this imaging is used to confirm the extent of instability in the spine. It is simply an x-ray in motion in flexion and extension of the spine. This is perhaps the most important test as the neurosurgeon suspects from my upright MRI that I have subaxial instability from C2-C4. Knowing the extent of my subaxial instability is important as it directly impacts treatment options  and this test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. MRV - The MRV is a angio/venogram (with contrast) of the brain and neck looking for possible stenosis or compression of any of the veins or arteries (especially the jugular veins). This is important as vascular stenosis can be a comorbidity or consequence of CCI and AAI  which I have been diagnosed with. If I have any compression  it may be able to be treated by a specialist here in the UK  which could alleviate symptoms - so it is important to know if I have it. Ophthalmologic exam - Similarly  the ophthalmologic evaluation checks for signs of papilledema or damage to the optical nerve from intracranial hypertension. Again  intracranial hypertension can be treated in the UK so this knowledge would be immensely useful for tackling my health moving forward. The results of these tests  and my original imaging and questionnaires would then be discussed in a face-to-face appointment. So far  I have been diagnosed by the neurosurgeon solely on the measurements of my MRI combined with my clinical history. A face-to-face appointment is important to confirm these diagnoses  discuss surgery and whether it is necessary  and ask any questions I might have. To this end  I am planning a trip to Barcelona in April and I have outlined a breakdown of the costs of the trip below: Cineradiology - €350 MRV - €700 Ophthalmologic exam - €220 Consultation - € 250 Total costs of tests and appointment - €1520  or approximately £1300. Additionally  we are also asking to partially crowdfund some of the costs of accommodation. The final accommodation isn’t booked yet but the cost is approximately £200 a night  with four nights total. Total costs of accommodation = £800 This means that we are asking for £2100 in total  with myself and my family paying for the remainder  including flights  the rest of the accommodation  transport  travel insurance  food  etc. Background information In 2011 I developed Myalgic Encephalomyelitis  a multi-systemic but primarily neuro-immune disease which has absolutely devastated my life. My health has declined a lot over the years; I had to give up schooling  became a wheelchair user in 2015  am unable to work  and now find myself bedbound/housebound a lot of the time. The symptoms are numerous and debilitating. I am in severe pain daily  my cognition is profoundly impacted  my muscles are significantly weakened  and my gastro-intestinal system is affected. I have developed co-morbid conditions  including a yet to be diagnosed heart condition. This is just a fraction of what I face. The crowdfunding campaign I did in 2015 to get my wheelchair absolutely changed my life for the better  and I would argue saved my life  given that I haven’t attempted suicide since I’ve had my wheelchair. I was able to take up archery  start several voluntary jobs which contribute a lot to society  become a lot more independent on a daily basis  travel the world  and save myself a lot of pain and speed of decline. However  my condition has still deteriorated  albeit a lot slower than it would have without my lifesaving wheelchair. For many years I had resigned myself to the fact that my disease is incurable  and in my case  progressive. However  in 2019 it progressed to be the worst it’s ever been and I lost a large amount of the little functionality I had left. This has left me in a dire place mentally  and at high risk of suicide. I started to do a lot more research into potential treatments and causes  most of which I had given up on years ago because of the prohibitive costs. I found that a small but growing subset of ME patients are finding that they have structural issues that cause symptoms similar to or the same as their ME symptoms. In October 2019 I found out that I am part of that subset  having both CCI and AAI as well as suspected subaxial instability. CCI in its most basic sense means that my head isn’t being properly supported by my neck  causing brainstem irritation and possible compression. As the brainstem is a vital component of a lot of bodily functions  this causes a whole host of symptoms  including tachycardia  heat intolerance  polydipsia  chronic fatigue  neck pain  facial pain  muscle weakness  dizziness and vertigo  and many others. AAI means that when I turn my head left or right  two of the uppermost vertebrae in my spine  the atlas and axis  are subluxing  which means a partial dislocation. As you can imagine  this causes many symptoms too. Whether the CCI is a cause or effect of my ME is unknown. It could be that the CCI is causing all of my ME symptoms  as in the case of Jen Brea and Jeffrey Wood (see below)  or it could be that the inflammation and tissue degradation that is part of my ME has caused the structural issues I am now facing due to my ligaments weakening. However  either way it needs to be addressed  and treating it could potentially improve some of my symptoms and give me more of a life. In order to treat it  we first need to know the extent of the problem  hence the testing. My life as is stands feels very unliveable. I am currently unable to partake in most of my voluntary jobs. I have had to give up archery  which was the sport I took up after having to give up cheerleading. I am slowly but surely losing everything that makes my life feel worthwhile. If I can regain at least some of my health  even to the level I was three years ago (still disabled)  that would be lifechanging  and saving. I am doing everything I can to make this happen  including private treatment for my ME in the UK. The CCI testing is a large and crucial part of the jigsaw. Unfortunately  none of this is available on the NHS. While the NICE guidelines are still under review  they currently promote CBT and GET as ‘treatments’ for ME  despite every ME expert in the world explicitly stating that this is harmful. I credit GET for the decline in my health that led to me becoming a wheelchair user. CBT is not an appropriate treatment for a neurological disease  though psychological support is crucial in dealing with such a devastating illness. I am receiving this mental health support on the NHS which I am immensely thankful for. Any treatment to address the underlying disease process and its effects (perhaps including the CCI) has to be done privately. I have briefly outlined below why I need help with this. If you would like to read more about CCI  please follow the links below: https://www.me-pedia.org/wiki/Craniocervical_instabilityhttps://centenoschultz.com/craniocervical-instability/https://medium.com/@jenbrea/health-update-3-my-me-is-in-remission-dd575e650f71 https://www.mechanicalbasis.org/ Why I need to crowdfund Due to the severity of my conditions I am unable to work and therefore my only income is disability benefits. A significant chunk of this contributes to my social care package which I use to employ a PA  and further money goes on monthly medical costs. So far I have been funding these investigations through money left to me by my Grandfather when he died  but this money is dwindling rapidly as I have spent a substantial amount of money on the Upright MRI and consultations alone. I need the rest for treatments in the UK  the cost of which is enormous. How your donation will help Any amount donated will help me get the testing I need to determine the extent of my CCI and AAI  which is the first step before I can undertake any treatments for it. Future treatments (which I will likely also have to crowdfund for) could give me my life back. What does that look like? It means me no longer being intensely suicidal every day. It means me being able to go back to my roles as a voluntary support worker for survivors of sexual violence; supporting some of the most vulnerable members of society at a local foodbank; and continuing my work as a local parish councillor. It also means me being able to get more involved with the activism that I am passionate about  and continue hobbies and passions that make my life feel enjoyable. If I am lucky enough to raise more than the amount I am aiming for initially  I will put this towards the cost of treatments  both for the CCI and ME  as these cost a significant amount of money and I am rapidly running out of resources  but desperately need the treatment.",True

It’s crazy how the pandemic we currently living in has caused all kinds of financial difficulties situations & families have had no choice but to turn to the food banks for help & assistance. I know that raising money will help the foodbank buy essential food. It saddens me to see how the numbers have doubled as more people are being impacted by covid with job losses and furlough leaving families struggling to find money to buy enough food .We have all seen the headlines regarding school meals but it's easy to forget for a lot of these children that is the only balanced meal they will get .  In the first six months of the pandemic  food banks in the trussell trust network gave out a staggering 1.2 million emergency food parcels   . That’s one food parcel every 13 seconds  and 2 600 of these went to children every day on average.  I decided to walk 2021 km & hopefully get this achieved within 10 months. So if you see me walking please give me a cheer and some motivational comments.

We know 2020 has been a tough year for most of us  and Christmas this year   won’t be the same for many of our residents due to the pandemic.    Whether you celebrate Christmas or not  the festive period is usually a time for   people to have a break from work and catch up with loved ones. But we know   this year will be very different for most of us.    The Council  BD_ Collective and partners have launched the Christmas Cheer   campaign to:    • Provide some hope that we will get through this together  • Re-connect people who may be feeling isolated  especially if they can’t see their loved ones  • Provide support to our most vulnerable residents  through financial assistance or a gift    Your support can help make someone’s Christmas a bit more cheerful. You could be helping an older person have a special Christmas dinner  or a child in need   receive a gift from Father Christmas.    Your donation will have a direct impact on someone’s life:    • A donation of £5 could go towards a stocking filler gift for a child   • A donation of £10 could go towards a Christmas giftfor a young person   • To donation of £20 could go towards a Christmas gift for an older or vulnerable person living alone  • A donation of £25 could go towards a food voucher or hamper for an older or vulnerable resident living alone  • A donation of £35 could go towards a food voucher or hamper for a family     All donations  big or small  are gratefully received. We will be working with our   voluntary sector partners and local foodbanks to provide residents in need this   Christmas with gifts  food and vouchers.    If you work for a company and think they could make a larger donation  we’d also love to hear from you and can discuss including your company name in our   appeal. For more information please contact us.     Please spread the news about the campaign on social media using   #ChristmasCheer to help us gain as much support as possible.

Next week I am going to Ruby Tuesday Hair   salon to have my hair cut off to donate to the   Little Princess Trust - they make wigs for   Children who have lost their hair because they   have been poorly.     We then decided I could also help Children / Families in our local area who need food by   raising money for cutting my hair off and then donating this money to the FoodBank in   Stockton and Billingham.    I am going to cut over 8 inches off my hair to   give to the Little Princess Trust and I hope to   raise £150 for the foodbank     Please give whatever you can as every   donation will help make a difference    Thank you very much    Zoe x ",True

We  the St. Peter’s Mutual Aid Sewing Club  are a small group in Islington  London  who began making cotton face masks for local charities  volunteers and the community in mid-April. As of mid-May  we have provided around 250 masks free of charge to local volunteers  a care home  a local fire station  a GP practice  food kitchens and vulnerable households. Our efforts were recently featured in the Islington Tribune. We are part of our local Mutual Aid Group  a Group of residents in the local community who have come together to support each other during this challenging time. Visit our website or contact us for further information.    We have just received a huge order for our cotton facemasks from a local hospital  after our design was vetted by a resident doctor. We need to produce ca. 2 000 masks for them over the coming weeks – a huge undertaking.     To date  our efforts have been financed almost entirely from personal sources. We now need your support for materials to produce these masks.    We are hoping to raise £1 000 in order to produce 2 000 masks. This breaks down as:    · ca. £700 for fabric      · ca. £120 for elastic      · ca. £100 for threads and paperclips      · ca. £80 for fabric and elastic expenditures for previous orders.

Thousands of people are suddenly out of work and literally cannot put food on the table.    According to the Trussell Trust’s data  families with children have been hit the hardest by the pandemic and over 1.2 million food parcels were given out to people during the crisis by the Trust from 1st April to 30th September 2020. The Trust estimates that a further 670 000 people will be getting into poverty in 2021 where they will not be able to afford essentials like food and energy utilities.    More people have now died from coronavirus in the second wave than the first wave. In the UK to date  a total of 97 329 people have died due to the pandemic and over 3.62 million people have been infected and the numbers are rising.     According to the Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance  the new variant of the virus spreads between 30% and 70% faster than others and hence it is 30% more deadly (BBC). It is now mandatory to use face masks in various indoor settings as per the UK government guidelines. (GOV.UK)    When people cannot afford to put food in their mouths how could they afford to buy a face mask to cover their mouths?    IT IS TIME TO ACT NOW AND DO SOMETHING TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE NEW VIRUS VARIANT!    With the support of GoFundMe  I have started the campaign   “Face Masks 4 Foodbanks” to help provide face masks to foodbanks which they will distribute to their users.     Your donations will be spent on buying face masks at supplier’s cost price which will be donated to the hundreds of families who get food parcels from the following food banks.     1. Newham Foodbank  2. Tower Hamlets Foodbank - Firstlove Foundation   3. Ealing Foodbank  4. Hackney Foodbank  5. Brent Foodbank  6. Hounslow Community FoodBox  7. Bow Food Bank - Newham  8. The Felix Project  9. The Open Kitchen  10. Feltham Foodbank  11. St Paul's (Hounslow) Food Bank    Your donations will help these foodbank users to not only protect themselves but also to keep the more vulnerable safe from being infected by the virus through the coronavirus droplets from coughs  sneezes and speaking.    Together  let’s stop the spread of COVID-19 and ease the pressure on our NHS services. I hope the people of the UK will continue to show their kindness  compassion and generosity during these unprecedented times and with your donation  we can win the battle of the unseen enemy COVID-19.

Her funeral is on 15th June. Unfortunately we can't safely have any other mourners  but a few people have asked whether they could make a donation in her memory. A lifelong Labour voter - despite having issues with pretty much every leader! - mum was a huge supporter of food banks. She could never understand how it was possible for such a supposedly wealthy nation to have so many people living in poverty. And the idea that people struggled to feed their children broke her heart. Times are hard  and no one knew that more than my mum. But if you're able to make a contribution  no matter how small  that would be wonderful.

This means that many who are over 70  who have underlying health conditions and who are pregnant will find it difficult to leave the house to buy essential supplies. Some of these people will not have the family and friend  or financial support needed to get through this crisis.    The supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and foodbanks up and down the country are running out of food.

Lives destroyed  false imprisonment  bankruptcy & suicide. We have until July 15th to raise the funds needed so time is running out.    The Post Office Horizon scandal. The Post Office which is a government and public owned company has been proven in the High Court to be hiding information regarding the robustness of its IT equipment  treating its staff in 'capricious  arbitrary ways which would not be unfamiliar to a mid-Victorian factory Owner and then seeking to cover it up either with government help or through total incompetence. The government had a duty to get it resolved as mentioned in National Audit Office and Internal Cross Party government documents regarding ‘Arms length businesses’ controlled by government for which Post Office is one of them.    There are over 550 claimants who completed costly litigation  with around the same amount waiting in the wings (and probably a lot more). Lives were destroyed  businesses lost  homes repossessed  bankruptcies  false imprisonment  families destroyed  health issues and suicides  all down to a total cover up of the truth. It has since been revealed there are over 1 500 further cases.    I was one of these claimants and due to lack of government intervention for which they were responsible for doing we had to find third party funding to bring this to a head. This means under UK law the cost of funding cannot be recovered from the Post Office and it is estimated claimants will not even recover a tiny fraction of losses incurred. Those who made the decisions including directors  management and the chairman remain running this business. The EX CEO Paula Vennells who decided to resign days before the first substantial judgement was released by the High Court has since been awarded a CBE  a position in the cabinet office of government and also chairs one of the largest NHS Groups (Imperial NHS). The support of MP's is growing in recent weeks across both sides of the house.    We need an inquiry to ensure ALL those responsible are held to account and all those who suffered are compensated for losses that they had no control over due to a failing IT system   draconian unfair contracts and horrific actions by Post Office Ltd.    The Post Office continued to fight the litigation even though days before they responded to the claimants pre-court action letter they held a board meeting where they approved a document that stated their Horizon IT system was 'not fit for purpose'. They then proceeded to spend over 50 million pounds of taxpayer cash telling the court Horizon was definitely robust  this alone proves they were willing to cover up the truth. Here is an extract of the judgement handed down on the 16th December 2019 :-    “The IT Strategy  which is referred to in this Update Decision Paper  and outlined that “the IT [Horizon] was not fit for purpose” and which was approved in July 2016 by the Post Office Board is  in my judgment  entirely consistent with my conclusions on the evidence. It is not  however  consistent with the Post Office’s response to the claimants’ pre-action letter  or the Defence in the group litigation  or the evidence adduced by the Post Office in the Horizon Issues trial. The Post Office’s solicitors’ response to the pre-action letter is dated 28 July 2016  very lengthy  and states that “the investigations to date have consistently pointed towards human error or dishonest conduct in branches as the most likely cause of shortfalls.” [H 954]    All this was a complete lie and they were willing to allow Postmasters to lose their livelihoods  their families  some their dignity and others their lives whilst at the same time blowing through millions in taxpayer cash to do so.    We are calling on this government to start a full Judicial Inquiry led by Fraser Justice.    Your pledge will help us take our complaint to the Parliamentary Ombudsman for maladministration in the government departments (BEIS - Department for Business  Energy and Industrial Strategy) and the relevant ministers so those who have suffered enormously over a 20 year period can get the answers  accountability and justice they rightly deserve and finally move on with their lives. It will not bring back those who have sadly taken their lives but it will allow the family members left behind to have closure and justice.    I can tell you on behalf of all those affected who have waited 2 decades to clear their names will be eternally grateful for all contributions.

Anything you can donate would be hugely appreciated and will hopefully help keep a family fed throughout these uncertain times.

She is at the beginning of a 6 month treatment plan and due to recieve her first Chemo this Friday (8th Jan)     Although Sammi is geared up to fight it like the bubbly enthusiastic young lady she is  the short time between diagnosis and the beginning of her treatment left her frustrated with the inability of current services to support her appropriately. Each service she found was aimed at children or older adults. As was most of the awareness advice towards checking for signs of the disease.     Sammi felt she needed supports designed for younger adults which dont exist yet! Whilst fighting her own battle she has devised a plan to help others along the way and beyond.    'Sammi's project' will be raising awareness and funds to establish a project aimed at young adults experiencing cancer  throughout Sammi's treatment. Her first Chemo is this Friday and this will also be the first stage of her plan to help others.     Stage 1 of her plan is to have her hair shaved off. She will do this along with some of the other volunteers who work with her at our Share Alike foodbank and wellbeing hub the day before her first Chemo.    Stage 2 she will be making a chemo vlog with special messages of support and awareness to help others.

Although we are currently closed due to the national lockdown. I attend the gym daily  keep it clean  prepare lesson plans and of course make myself available for those dropping off for our foodbank and for those who are also collecting from our foodbank. I also use the space to record exclusive video content for our students. This power surge has meant no power or heat and even the electric shutters failed  meaning we couldn’t gain access. With no help from the local council  this financial burden has hit us hard. This is worrying for us with no financial support. Planning a way of recovering from this  in our attempt to keep the gym going in this unprecedented time  has left us with sleepless nights. Some friends and students have already dropped in  and we are not above accepting help and will always accept it gratefully.

Managing our foodbank for those that have been hit hard during these challenging times. Creating a safe space for people who need to deal with their mental health and well-being. Providing martial arts classes  online content and training for all our loyal students. Whilst we wait for contractors to complete work. We are assured that we will gain access to the building soon.

On 8/11/20 (Hill Day) I'll be attempting to run up one of the Isle of Wight' s steepest hills as many times as I can in 1 hour to raise money for the Ventnor Community Foodbank.     The initial response from friends has been: 'Why the hell do you want to do that??!' And that's a very good question...    So here's my answer:  I started running here on the Island to keep me sane. After difficult times it gave me a positive frame of mind I could not live without nowadays. During Lockdown it became a way for me to be worthwhile and happy when tens of thousands of people in the UK have struggled to do so in 2020.     The perverse thing is  I started to love running up hills. The steeper the better  I began to relish the challenge! Fortunately  Ventnor is full of the bloody things  and being a masochistic b******d I picked the steepest one with a road on it I could. The Hill With No Name runs 1/2 mile in length up a height of 317 feet (peak is 672 feet above sea level). Seriously  a cable car would be a viable way of getting up it. It's a bit of a monster.    So the plan is to run/walk/crawl as many times up it as possible in 1 hour. My chosen charity is the Ventnor Community Foodbank who do an invaluable job of supporting children and families here. During these trying times they deserve all the help they can get in supporting local people. Please check out their facebook page for info about donation points and what they need.    https://www.facebook.com/Ventnor-Community-Foodbank-112414990512592/    Here's a time-lapse of the hill. Should give you an idea of what I'm letting myself in for.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42UtMQf0hss    A.",True

Despite lockdown  supplies and healthcare resources are running low especially for those who need them barring recreational use. Thus  we have started raising money for masks and gloves and are buying them from multiple sellers and are distributing them to the hospitals  care homes and those in need. We will be self distributing in the appropriate sense respecting lockdown rules. There are no profits to be made  as well as our own money all donations will be used to pay for those healthcare resources (gloves & masks) to form healthcare packages to those in need. We will also be making food packages for foodbanks and those in need. In full transparency  your money will be in safe hands  through the GofundMePage the withdrawn funds will be placed in an individual bank account rather than a collective foundation. The donations will be used directly as funds for healthcare resources to be given to the places mentioned previously. Inshallah. It is all non profit  every little can help whether it be a small donation or contributing supplies. Stay home and stay safe. Thank you/Jazakallahkairun In memory of Nasir Ahmed.

We may need an additional £20k towards the costs of the building but can't approach either funder for more. We have put in over 18 months worth of bid writing  meetings  reports  council applications  lease issues  blood  sweat and tears  to get us to where we are now. We have worked too hard to fall at this final hurdle. The site is used by 2 organisations. The Inclusion Network CIC provide free youth club activities for local young people  free school holiday youth provision  youth projects  community projects  a foodbank session once a week and European project opportunities for y.p's. They are funded by Children In Need  Henry Smith Foundation and several other smaller funders. This is for 48 weeks of the year.

They have been set up as a charity since the mid 1990's and have engaged and worked with thousands of young people. It is entirely volunteer led and they have an unbelievable group of people that help run it. Between the 2 organisations we provide approx. 18 000 attendances by young people per year (approx. 25 000 if you count the parents that bring them).

We have converted the football changing rooms into a small community centre which comprises of a small meeting/group room  small IT room  a small (falling apart) kitchen  a few toilets and a couple of other storage type rooms. We have the basics like light  electricity  gas etc  but we have no central heating  21st century facilities or no real space to engage even more of the community we care about.

We have been working with the 2 nationally recognised funders mentioned at the start of this story (Sport England and The Steve Morgan Foundation) and have secured 100k of their funding towards this project but we are still falling short of the possible build costs of £120k+. We are hoping this crowdfunding page gets us halfway there!! We are also hoping that all of the people who know us as organisations  and as professionals  can see how close we are to securing a centre that will be fit for purpose  but also know how much work and effort we put into this centre and this community.    Will you please support us and allow us to gain a centre that will still be here in another 25/30 years time serving the local (and further afield) children  young people and adults of our community.",True

Yesterday my school year bubble was told we had to self-isolate until the 11th October. At first  I was worried and scared but when I realised that I was not going to be able to litter pick every day I was so upset.    Last night I sat and thought what if I could do something during my isolation to help my community from home. Me and my sisters spent some time thinking and we came up with the idea of ‘Cycling for Cans’.    During the next 12 days me and my two older sisters are going to attempt to cycle (on the exercise bike) all the way to London from our hometown of Blyth! For every mile we do at the end we will donate a can (or item) to Blyth Food Bank. So if we succeed and reach London that would be 296 miles.    Brandon really wants to join in to but he is too small for the bike he has been set his own little challenge while he takes over my litter picking and for every aluminium can he collects during his school run litter picks  1 can (or item) will be added to the total.    I will be sharing our journey with you and have made a window display which will keep us focused on our end goal as we will be cycling in front of it.      I would also really love to also raise £50 to donate alongside our food donation to help and we would be so grateful if you could share our story.    Love   Sophie  Brandon  Caitlin  and Lily.

Making a donation to the Sandown & Shanklin Independent Lifeboat could ensure the safety of someone you love.""  ""We all see the food bank collection box when we go to the supermarket  probably like me you put something in from time to time.

(That's the equivalent of a return overland trip from Guildford to Rome!)    Over 20 members of the Guildford City Swimming Club's Junior County A(&B) teams have come together to combine their shared passion for sport and fitness into a mission to travel 1889km between them over a five week period.    Why 1889km? GCSC was founded in 1889 so we thought it was a fitting target ... and a good challenge at an average of nearly 100km per person (or c. 2.5km a day).     We are all aged between 8-11 years old and will be supported by our families in our endeavour. Starting on May 25th  we will strive to cover the 1889km by any human-powered method we can - be it walking  running  cycling or even swimming if we can get access!     And we'd love to raise funds for the North Guildford Foodbank along the way. Supporting families in our local area who need a little extra help  particularly at this difficult time. It will certainly motivate us to know that we can help others at the same time as challenging ourselves  and to know that you are cheering us along as well.

I'm raising money in aid of Sussex Community Development Association Food Bank and every donation will help. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to me.      The Mayor of Peacehaven  Cllr. Claude Cheta has launched a campaign asking residents to donate either a tin or jar of food which will be delivered to the Seahaven Food Bank.  Cllr. Cheta has picked this charitable organisation to support whilst in post as Mayor.    Peacehaven Town Council are open for donations every weekday morning at Community House  Meridian Centre; however  we understand that the normal way of life has drastically changed over the past three months and it may be difficult to carry out a shopping trip to the supermarket. Bearing this in mind  we have also set up a GoFundMe so you can donate to the Mayor’s appeal without having to leave the house.    Either way it will help this vital cause. The Seahaven Foodbank covers the Havens which includes Peacehaven clients.    Seahaven Foodbank  also known as Newhaven Foodbank  provides food parcels to families and individuals in Newhaven  Sussex  and the surrounding areas.  The falloff in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that the food bank has had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one-week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries.  All donations to the Mayor’s GoFundMe page will go directly to the food bank.

Market Hill Fisheries are crowd funding to cover the cost of ingredients in order to provide FREE meals for children that need them the most.    The recent decision not to provide food vouchers for children is something we feel very strongly about. Since the announcement  we’ve seen other businesses around the country offer their support to those affected and we wanted to do the same.    So this half term we would like to offer free hot meals for any child in our community that would normally have a food voucher. To claim a free meal  just ask for a ‘School Meal’ - it’s that simple.    If you know of anyone in need  please tell them that this offer is available. We’ll be doing this throughout half term whilst the shop is open  from Wednesday 28th to Saturday 31st October.     All money raised will go directly towards providing meals for children and any money remaining will be donated to a relevant charity.     Finally  we’d also ask that anyone who feels strongly about this issue to contact their local MP and tell them why you think this is so important.     Thank you.      Read about it on Facebook    Update 23 October  We've had a overwhelmingly and totally unexpected response to the campaign and we've met our initial target!    After some thought we've decided to extend the target to provide free meals over the Christmas holidays too.    Thanks to all of those who have supported us!    Update 10 November    We are really pleased to announce we've donated £908.81 to the Scunthorpe Foodbank. (The difference is the GoFundMe admin fee).    The money was originally raised to fund free meals for children over the school holidays at Market Hill Fisheries. Our initial fundraising target was overwhelmingly exceeded with donations from all over the country and we pledged to donate the money to a relevant local charity. Having researched local charities we've selected the Scunthorpe Foodbank as they serve Winterton.     Applications for foodbank vouchers can be applied for through these organisations (https://scunthorpe.foodbank.org.uk/get-help/local-voucher-agencies/).

Through this site as well as other private donations  we raised a total of £2 215 (Q 22 747 Guatemalan Quetzales). Amazing!!!    It is time I reported back more fully on how your generous contributions are being spent.    So far  from this money  we have spent 8566 Quetzales (roughly £834) on medical examinations  care  medication and journeys. Details of these expenses can be seen below. During the process of working with the family  several issues have come to light  mostly the extreme poverty in which they have been living. Their home  which is made of sheets of corrugated iron  is very poorly constructed. It is covered in a sheet of plastic which offers insufficient protection from the weather  continually subjecting the house (and its contents) to damage from rain and flooding. The family also has no access to clean water  which has resulted in poor health  parasites and stomach infections. With regards to the operations we believed were necessary  it turns out that only Alex  the older boy  needs surgery. Alex has  however  chosen to wait until the pandemic lessens because the public hospitals continue to prioritise COVID-19 patients and it is deemed unsafe for non COVID patients. The good news is that the medical examinations showed us that the surgery appears not to be as urgent as previously believed. We will  therefore  wait until there is more capacity in the hospitals to treat non-COVID patients. It has also been agreed by the hospital  that when it does take place  the surgery can be performed without cost. We  therefore  have £1 382 to aid the family in other ways. After much discussion with the family and careful consideration  we have decided to spend your donations as follows. I hope you will support the proposal:-    Asociación Vida will be supporting the family to make improvements to their home  in particular to the roof. The estimated cost for these improvements is £563. They will also install an electric water pump system to enable them to access clean water at the push of a button (cost: £205). Doña Felipa has  unfortunately  accrued some debts as a result of their struggle to survive  and are being hounded constantly to repay the debts. We have agreed to pay off their debts which amount to £390. To help the family to avoid the need for any loans in the future  we have offered to give them £146 in order to help the mother start up an embroidery business. We are also spending £78 on necessary medical care. Asociación Vida are committed to supporting this family as they get back on their feet. As soon as Alex feels that he is happy to go ahead with the surgery  and if it is still deemed necessary  Asociación Vida will support him in journeys to the hospital and so on.    Details of the expenses and budget for the next stage of support can be found below. I know the destination of your donations has changed somewhat  but I hope that you will agree that it will go a long way in helping the family. Photos to follow in due course.

As well as running a medical centre  they work with some of the poorest communities to improve health  nutrition and living conditions. Patzún  where I lived has a lot of poverty and now  with the current pandemic  this situation has only worsened. As in the UK  people have been unwell or died from the virus and many people have found themselves unable to work - only in Guatemala there is no furlough scheme  no NHS  no foodbank and no benefits of any kind. If a household has absolutely no food  they are draping a white flag out of their home (or just holding it up in the street if they are homeless) and the village will do what they can to share their food.    Through friends of mine living in Patzún  I have recently been introduced to a widow  named Doña Filipa. She lives in a home made of corrugated iron with her three sons  Alex (17 years)  Edy (14) and Jonatan (11). The elder two boys used to help their mother with living costs by doing whatever work they could – manual work  selling ice-creams and so on. However  a month ago (on 6th May)  the sons were out collecting wood for their mother when they slipped and fell 25 metres down a ravine  resulting in one boy having a serious hip and rib injury and the other boy with broken legs. They are bed-ridden and both urgently need medical attention and operations. However  as there is no NHS in Guatemala  they would need to pay the hospital £2000 for this to take place  which is simply not possible.     We have already managed to raise some of this amount  but I wondered if  by sharing their story here  some of my lovely friends might be willing to contribute a small amount towards helping this family out. The money will be sent to Asociación Vida*  who will oversee any support we can offer this family – ideally enabling the sons to receive all the medical attention they need. Any help would be wonderful. If you want more detail about this  please message me – I just didn’t want to write too much on here. Thank you    *Asociación Vida is a registered charity  partnered by Tearfund UK.       Update: 3rd July 2020    I am so grateful to report that we have already raised over £500 towards this cause. Thank you so much for your generosity. The last few days have been spent taking the boys to the clinic in Patzún for some medical checks - and also to the hospital in Chimaltenango for X-rays and consultations with an orthopaedic specialist. The outcome of this visit is that Edy  the younger of the boys  needs an operation to correct the bones that have started to set in the wrong position since the accident took place two months ago. This operation is going to cost 20 000 Quetzales (about £2 085). The elder boy  Alex  will have an MRI scan on his back tomorrow (4th July) and from there a decision will be made about the treatment required. If you are in a position to give anything... we'd be so grateful. If you are not in a position to give financially  we would so value your prayers for these boys. Thank you so much xx      Update: 16th July    Thank you so much for your all your donations. We have all been blown away by your generosity :o)    We are still awaiting an appointment with the neuro specialist (re-scheduled for this Friday) to discuss the findings from Alex’s MRI scan. It is feared he may have serious spinal injuries  which could lead to paralysis. However  due to the COVID 19 outbreak  travelling to the capital for these appointments  amidst the government restrictions  is not proving to be easy at all.    If you are the praying type  please pray that nothing prevents this appointment with the specialist from taking place this Friday. Give thanks for all the money that has been donated and pray that it will be sufficient for both boys to receive the operations and treatment they need.    Thank you so much!      Update: 25th July    Thank you so much to everyone who has donated to this cause. Your generosity has been overwhelming.    Since my last update  the pandemic in Guatemala has worsened as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increase daily alongside the number of deaths caused by the virus. The Government’s very strict lockdown measures have also made it difficult for the boys to be taken to their hospital appointments in the capital  with police issuing fines to people who travel even for medical purposes. Nevertheless  both boys have finally received the results from their X-rays and MRI scans  which were able to take place thanks to your donations. Alex requires the most urgent surgery  as his spinal injuries could easily lead to paralysis. We await news from the hospital about when this can take place. Unfortunately  the Roosevelt hospital  where the procedure will happen  is rampant with COVID-19  with many members of staff and patients having died from the virus. This is obviously of great concern to the family  who  therefore remain somewhat nervous about their upcoming treatment.    If you are the praying type  please pray that the operations will take place soon – and for protection  healing and restoration for the whole family. Amazingly  we should have some surplus money from your donations  so Asociación Vida are making plans to offer further support to this family as well as to others who are also in great need. Please pray for wisdom for them as they seek to best meet the needs of their community at this very pressing time.    Matiox Chawe!

That’s because the cost of purchasing the food their users need far exceeds their operating budget from donations.   But canned goods are not enough. says food banks like Margate Independent Foodbank desperately need financial donations too  for several reasons. The first is to pay running costs to run the operation. “There’s a whole infrastructure that’s required to make sure  beyond just receiving the donation  that food is safely processed and distributed into our community ” he says. Money is also a good donation option because the vast amount of food donations arrive between November and Christmas  and having cash on hand helps them buy food during the remaining months  since people are hungry year-round. It also helps them buy supplies to meet specific clients’ needs  such as culturally appropriate foods. In addition  food banks are able to look for discounts and purchase food at wholesale  which means they are able to get more out of that Pound than a person shopping retail probably could.   ",True

Exchanging gifts  cards or organising the office Secret Santa is harder this year  so perhaps consider making a donation to the Trussell Trust or Ediblelinks who coordinate Warwickshire’s foodbanks.    Warwickshire food banks provide a crucial lifeline to people in need across the county.     There are seven food banks in the Trussell Trust network operating across Warwickshire; Arden Foodbank  Bedworth Foodbank  Fosse Foodbank  Nuneaton Foodbank  Rugby Foodbank  Stratford upon Avon Foodbank and Warwick District Foodbank. They provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to people locked in poverty. As part of a nationwide network of foodbanks they also work to combat poverty and hunger  campaigning for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. Foodbanks are run by local people for local people and rely on the community’s support to ensure that they can continue to stop people going hungry.     The Healthy Living Network manages the Edible links project based in Atherstone  North Warwickshire. Previously known as North Warwickshire Food Bank  Edible links uses food surplus to reduce poverty  stress and diet related ill health. They run a food bank and provide community groups with food enabling them to help more local people. This year they will be providing over 250 food hampers to families in need across Warwickshire. And are also running a campaign to encourage people to sponsor a Christmas present for a child in Northern Warwickshire. For a £10 donation they will buy a present for a child and every pound goes towards local families.",True

We wanted to provide them with something  so they wouldn't feel like they would be returning to school in Sept on the 'back foot' to those children whose families were not struggling financially. We managed to provide more than £2000 worth of books  to more than 450 children in the Taff-Ely Foodbank area. This year  as we find ourselves in a 3rd lockdown as a country  we have found the number of children whose families are in need of help from Taff-Ely Foodbank  has almost tripled!Our main driver behind this is  how can we help to provide educational material to children when their parents cannot afford to put food on the table  or pay for basic neccessities that we would take forgranted like gas  electric and broadband providers.    That's why  this year we are going bigger than ever! Our aim is to raise £10 000 to provide atleast 2 books for all 1400 children  whose families receive support from the foodbank. They should NOT be at a disadvantage because of circumstances that are beyond their control. Every child has the right to a quality education  and not even a pandemic will hinder our efforts to ensure that this happens within our local area! ",True

Thank you for taking the time to visit my page!    In July 2021  I will be undertaking a 900+ mile charity bike ride from Land's End to John O'Groats in order to raise money for various charities which have seen their fundraising adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. My aim is to raise a minimum of £10 000  and that is where I need your help!    Charities of all descriptions have seen a huge surge in demand over the last 12 months for a variety of reasons. These could include situations such as those needing to turn to charities for basic provisions such as food and clothing following a redundancy or loss of earnings in the household  mental health advice and care perhaps having become isolated or worried about their future prospects  those seeking help as a vulnerable person maybe as a result of domestic abuse  or indeed children suffering as a consequence of some of these things through no fault of their own. The list goes on.....    Many of you may know that I had planned to undertake this trip on a Penny Farthing. Due to the added logistic complexity  I had been crowdfunding some of the expedition costs over the last few months  however it became clear last week that there is a lack of Penny Farthing stock that would be the right size for me  meaning that I would have to delay the quest until next year  which would be no good for those charities in need immediately.    The good news is all funds are now able to go directly to chosen charities  so we are already off to a great start! Thank you to all those who have already contributed and shown support so far - it means a lot!    I have also been exploring the idea of business / corporate sponsorship to help raise funds in return for promotion  and would be happy to discuss with you or your marketing team how we could work together. I would be happy to wear or display your branding throughout the trip  as well as mention and give thanks to your business in all social media surrounding the trip  both in the lead up and training (from now)  during the trip  and shortly afterwards  whatever works best for you. I will also be documenting the trip thoroughly with a view to producing a short docufilm on return  so branding can also feature in this. Please contact me to discuss a proposal if interested.    I am also keen to hear from people who have suggestions for charities  although I would like them to be based around the topics mentioned above (mental health  foodbanks  children  vulnerable people)  although I am open minded if you have something in mind of particular note personally.    Anything you can do to help will go a long way  and thank you all for your support!    Rich :-)",True

It has been a very long lonely poverty-stricken journey. I have tried to impact my community through volunteering in different capacities since I am not allowed to engage in any paid activities.     However  I am so limited in what I can offer  I have a language barrier. Moving to this area of England and volunteering in what is to be a foreign language has been challenging  and the experience has given me an appreciation of how languages work and how they are a vital part of our everyday experience. I hope to develop a greater intellectual understanding of languages by taking a course in French studies.     Unfortunately  I cannot afford to sponsor myself.    I am raising money for my tuition which is £500.00 and £500.00 for learning materials. I have applied for this course in the university and have till the 17th December to pay the tuition as the school will not reserve a place for me without payment According to the school  there will be studying materials we will need to purchase for a better understanding of the course but they are not yet known until our first lecture in January 2021.    I am a hard worker and have enjoyed the character-building experiences that life in the UK has to offer. During the first national lockdown  I have volunteered at hospitals and underground tube stations  presently involved with the FoodBank  an experience that I found very rewarding. I enjoyed directing and assisting visitors and participating in activities such as training  distributing facial masks  shopping for the vulnerable and the needy. I have developed a greater awareness of the world around me  as a result of both the experience of moving to a new country and my volunteering activities. Inspired by this I plan to become more closely involved in various voluntary causes which I believe make a crucial difference to the local and global community.     I am a member of the London Squad Volunteers for the UEFA EURO 2020 which will require me to come in contact with people from different countries. I am also planning to volunteer with Princes Alice and to become involved in fundraising activities. These interests and experiences have led me towards being interested in learning an additional language and I feel that the themes studied in a French course and the skills acquired would give me great help in preparing me for these roles and pave career paths for me. It will also help me to be occupied and busy and engage with people and the community. I appreciate your time in contributing to this fund. I’m looking forward to becoming a French student.

Tzedakah  Seva  Zakat  Dana  Charity. Whatever we may call it  helping those in need is a value which bonds all of our communities together and now is a time where we must do exactly that.    Covid-19 has hit all of us in different ways and brought with it many challenges. For some  that challenge is simply trying to feed themselves and their family. Sadly  an estimated 1 in 8 people in the UK don’t have enough food to eat and foodbanks are struggling to meet demand.     We want to do something about it. That is why BIJA will be partnering with Amrit Mann of the Panjab Restaurant in Covent Garden who are already doing great work providing preparing meals and supplying overstretched food banks*. Our aim is to raise £5000 (half of which is matched funding) which will provide 10 000 food boxes to those going hungry this winter.     Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank has agreed to provided matched funding enabling the provision of 10 000 food parcels – for every £1 donated  Mizrahi will give £1.    BIJA Co-Chair Zaki Cooper said:    “As a charity  we think it’s really important that our two communities use their relationship to benefit wider society  and show that they can help to solve social problems. Hunger  particularly amongst children  affects millions of people in the UK. Marcus Rashford and others have highlighted the issue  and we want to play our own small part in addressing it too.”    Matthew Plax  Head of Corporate Banking at Mizrahi Tefahot Bank  said:    “Hunger has always been a problem in the UK – it’s not just an issue for developing countries. However  this has been proliferated by the pandemic and thanks to the efforts of several high-profile role models  it is finally getting the rightful attention it deserves. Mizrahi Tefahot Bank  London Branch are proud to support this crucial cross-communal fundraiser  providing food packages to those most in need.”    You can help support us feed those who might otherwise go hungry this winter. Together  our communities can make a difference to so many lives.    Wishing you a happy and healthy 2021.        *The foodbanks we will be supporting include: The Queens Crescent Community Association  Highgate Newton Community Centre  Food Aid Hub  Castle Haven Community Centre NW1 (and the Clarence Way Terrence Hall)  The London Irish Centre  Islington Parent Carers Network  Camden Free School Meals.     We are also supporting a large number of individuals and families via the New Journal food aid list.",True

""When I was a child like many growing up  I suffered from a lack of confidence and belief within myself  at the time and even to this day I was amazed and overwhelmed by HOW BIG and SCARY this world could be to a child raised in a single-parent household. I was told never to expect too much from myself. But my mother imparted me with a very important life lesson that I now follow to this day and that is  ""In order to be a leader you must first learn to love and lead yourself.""    I know now  that time has come  for me now and this is my announcement to the rest of the world  that I'm ready to lead this world into a new era of posperity and unity. A world where we are connected through our pride and success of how far we've come together  instead of a world hindered by our differences.    WHY I NEED YOUR HELP ?    I want to use my experience   talents and skillsets to empower young and old black people from across the world through global development and green technology.    I will help fulfil and unkept legacy and help the people of Africa and the Carribean  to realise the potential within them.    HOW WOULD I ACCOMPLISH THIS ?    Providing a continental high class quality education system that is free for all of its citizens.    Utilise Green technology to begin to address the solutions that can be made for ensuring a future for all the world and its inhabitants.    Providing free electricity and access to the internet for all nations in Africa and the Carribbean.    A continent united under one constitution.    A country where our resources and talents are not exploited and abused by corporations that do not hold the interests of the people or its land.    A nation where poverty  war and social-economic exploitation is a thing of the past.    A continental foodbank that can address hunger and be used in cases of national disaster and emergency.    A continent that supports the art of learning  intergrity and the pursuit of truth just as much as its academia.    A nation that can be called HOME for its citzens and descendants all over the world.    A continent that loves its people and doesn't suffer from the actions of leaders that abuse their power.    To create solutions for major diseases affecting African lives  including malaria and HIV/AIDS.    This is the grand vision that I have for the people that I care so much about  but in order to do that I first need your help ! Regardless of whether its through financial help  wisdom or networking  I have a vision to create a better world that isn't just about myself or what I can gain out of this  that's why any advice and support is just as greatly appreciatied.    WHY AM I DOING THIS ?    I want to create a world where we stop protesting about being shot  killed or mistreated and can begin to celebrate the evolution of how powerful we truly are and how far we've come. I know I am not the first to have thought of all these ideals but I know I will be the first to deliver them for the benefit of others.      I would like to thank anyone that has read this far  and I wish nothing but the best for you and your loved ones. I am only one mind  but I would appreciate any exchange of thoughts and ideas to build a better world.    Below are a list of the commitments that I will make to the people who are kind enough to aid me in my goals  I've also attached a document of why I am qualified for the role.

Following the forced closure of our nursery business during the COVID 19 lockdown  we began experiencing firsthand the impact to many families with Children when it came to food preparation. Initially we developed single portion healthy pots of food to be microwaved at home to give some practical help to families. After running a survey of our parents  it became very evident that this product would help all families in the exact same position  but with less financial resource. At this point we began donating 1 pot for every 10 pots we sell to a family in need.    After delivering pots of food to many families in need  I wanted to detach the condition of selling my product  which is why I started this GoFundMe page.

The most vulnerable are being stripped of the benefits they desperately need. The Tories’ austerity is destroying lives.    This is not justice. It’s a Tory choice. It’s not acceptable. It’s not inevitable. And there is an alternative.    The story of the West Midlands is becoming like a ‘tale of two cities’. There are cranes in our skies. But our homeless neighbours are sleeping in the doorways beneath  where someone now dies every fortnight.    Our society feels like it’s ripping apart. Brexit has divided us. In its wake  hate crime and violent crime has surged. Communities no longer feel safe. Islamophobia and homophobia are spiralling while the far right goes on the march.    Meanwhile  our economy is failing a generation. Over half the people in poverty in the West Midlands are in work. Half our wards are in poverty. Youth unemployment is up by a 20% while apprenticeships have collapsed. For thousands of our young people  their possibilities in life are defined by the post-code where they’re born. And looming above the crisis  is a climate that is warming faster than we thought  posing an existential threat to generations to come.    We cannot stand by and watch this happen. We cannot be by-standers. And we cannot let the Tories make it worse. If we don’t take a stand today then ten years from now  we will be more divided than ever in our history. There may be gleaming office blocks and fortunes for some. But inequality will spiral. Entrenched poverty will deepen.

Money raised will help towards fabric costs and sourcing and then distributed to a group of volunteers who make the clothing for our amazing frontline staff.

My name is Hope and I have been a Hackney resident for almost six years. I feel very fortunate to live in such a brilliant area  and want to give something back.    Covid-19 has unfortunately left many in crisis  and the need for support from the community has been higher than ever.     In 2020  Hackney Foodbank reported that 19 400 households needed their support. This is a 263% increase from 2018.     The Government are currently offering an uplift in Universal Credit of £20 per week. However  they plan to stop this at the end of March. This has the potential to drive a further one million people to foodbanks across the UK.    Like everyone else  the majority of my last year has been spent on daily walks - now I want to make those steps count.     To raise money for my local foodbank  and awareness of the upcoming cuts in Universal Credit  I will be walking  running and cycling 20km a day for 20 days starting on Friday 25th March. This works out as 400km in distance  or around 4.5hours of walking a day.    My target is £400  £1 per km and I would love for you to sponsor me!     Any amount will be appreciated  even £5 will go a long way to making a difference in someone's life!     Thank you!",True

I have also become aware that during Lockdown  Mark Cavendish (he’s a professional cyclist for those who haven’t heard of him) had completed a Virtual Everesting. The idea behind this is to complete a bike ride where the vertical climb is the same as the summit of mount Everest by going up and down the same stretch of road as many times as it takes to complete the 8849 meter ascent of Everest. And because I am an idiot  this sounded like something I should attempt.    Claire  Aidan and Emmy have suggested that if they are going to give up the front room of our home for a day (I’m aiming to finish it in 14hrs) then the least they should get out of it is the knowledge that some money was raised for a good cause not just pandering to my stupidity in the face of a challenge. As a result  I am going to try to raise as much money as possible for the Trussell Trust.

My life has been privileged and compared to most  easy. So instead of getting drunk on cheap wine and eating cake  I will play video games for 12 hours & raise money for two foundations that are near to my heart.     First up - Stand Against Racism & Inequality. For those who are unaware  my half-brother is black. We were adopted when we were younger  and out of our many siblings  the majority of them are black. Living in a small Illinois town they were an oddity  and racism did exist. Not a day goes by where my family & I do not worry about each other  but we worry more about the ones who can be murdered for just being black in a white world.     50% of the donations that are raised over the course of the fundraiser will be donated to Stand up Against Racism & Inequality.     You can learn more about the charity by visiting their website: https://www.sariweb.org.uk/who-we-are/about-sari/      This is not a Black Lives Matter only organization  but helps with all racism  bigotry  and sexism. But their focus is helping victims of hate crimes  and with those on the rise in the UK we can all agree that its a good cause.       The second foundation is Paddington Partnership: https://www.thisispaddington.com/paddington-partnership/about-us    They work with businesses in the Paddington area to raise money  donate their time and help out at some of the less fortunate areas of Paddington. This is interesting because our Building we work in is about 50 Million  but if I cross the street and walk 3 minutes  there's a crap block of flats full of people struggling. Paddington Partnership takes the privileged workers in these fancy offices & pairs them with programs and events to help those in need.     My team at work read with the students of King Solomon Academy every week  and have for nearly 3 years now. I personally run a monthly bookclub at the Marlybone Woman's shelter where we're currently reading David Sedaris.    On top of that  every year 3-4 groups get together to help in the community in various ways. Food banks  Soup Kitchens  putting a party on for Halloween or even gardening & cleaning the school grounds.     50% of the proceeds will be sent to Paddington Partnership to be split 3 ways between the following:    King Solomon Academy:https://kingsolomonacademy.org/about-us/welcome-2  The Marlybone Project: https://www.maryleboneproject.org.uk/  The North Paddington Foodbank: https://www.npfoodbank.org.uk/      If you are able to donate  I would appreciate it. If you can not donate  please help by spreading the word. I can't change the world alone  but together maybe we can make a start in the right direction. Thank you.",True

During the first 6 months of the pandemic  food banks saw a 47% rise in need  and the Trussell Trust sent out 1.2 million emergency food parcels. This Christmas  obviously  things are even harder; due to the pandemic  many people have been laid off  or furloughed  making it nearly impossible to live. Food and heating are luxuries  and are rationed  or even substituted.     I have never had to worry about whether or not I was going to eat that night  nor if I would be cold. More so  I would say sometimes I do not appreciate that enough.     It is SO easy to not see your privilege in some circumstances  especially when we are constantly comparing ourselves to celebrities and people who have more than us  and it’s easy to be ignorant to the fact that some people need our help.     I have set up a Gofundme for the Trussell Trust in relation to me running the 100km in a month. Small donations go a long way  donating even £2 is a big difference and a huge support . The link is in my bio.     You can also donate to @bournemouthfoodbank via the link in their bio as the cause is a lot closer to home and also needs just as much support.       As well as this  donating to food banks  with long lasting and precooked foods helps just as much! Food banks take donations in most stores such as Tesco  Sainsbury’s and Asda  most religious and community buildings as well as at the food banks themselves.      A like and share would also be very appreciated as I would like to raise as much awareness and money for the cause as possible.

Last year I was devastated to learn  how many children under 15 were living in poverty here in the UK and that many families were struggling to put food on the table let alone Christmas presents under the tree. knowing the Joy I felt running down the stairs on Christmas morning as a child I decided to create a gift giving initiative where were managed to raise 500+ gifts for children who may not have had anything to open otherwise. We then distributed these gifts with the help of Fareshare UK across their food banks in the South West.           This year however  it is clear that due to the devastating affects of COVID-19 many of our food banks are struggling and are worried about the up and coming winter months. I can not imagine families not having enough to eat during the coldest time of the year and therefore I have instead decided to set this page up in hopes of raising money to purchase food supplies.    We have a Van that has kindly been donated for the purpose of distributing supplies and a list of all the organisations we plan to donate them to will follow.    Your money will go directly to purchasing all these items. Foodbanks not only need food  but toiletries and every day house hold items such as washing up liquid.         We will be delivering these supplies to:    North Bristol Foodbank  Address: Ebenezer Church  286 Filton Ave  Bristol BS7 0BA    The Trussell Trust Food Bank  Address: St Marks Baptist Church  St Marks Rd  Easton  Bristol BS5 6HX    The Trussell Trust Food Bank  Crisis Centre Ministries  St Paul's  Bristol BS2 8TP    Bristol North West Foodbank  Bristol North West Foodbank Social Justice Hub St. Andrew's Church  Avonmouth Rd  Avonmouth  Bristol BS11 9EN    For all updates please return to this page where I will regularly be updating you with images and information on any additional food banks we support.

When we hear the word ‘poverty’ we often think of children in third world countries who have absolutely nothing and although these children are suffering and need our help too  we also have millions of people on our doorstep using foodbanks every day to feed their families. The wage gap in our country is ever growing under our current government and until we can make big changes to stop it once and for all- we must do what we can to individually help those around us. I used to work as a door-to-door charity fundraiser and often found that the most generous people were those with virtually nothing. They always wanted to sign up and do what they could to help as they knew what it was like to struggle that much. These people have inspired me for years and now I want to do something to help give back. So this is why I have decided to do a sponsored fast to help raise funds for a foodbank Initiative in my favourite place in the UK- Hackney!

It supports community centres  youth projects  foodbanks and schools all over the UK. and anticipate that demand for food will not drop this winter.     I chose GoFundMe because funds are passed automatically to the charity without it having to pay a processing fee; it also gives 100% of Gift Aid directly to the charity.     I hope you agree this is a worthy charity. I plan to stop the donations on 11 December 2020 so that the funds can reach the charity in time to be used over the seasonal period.

We started off supporting Food Banks with large quantities of food items which were about to go to waste  donated to us by a company. Since then we have formed alliances with organisations and churches and have continued the work of supporting Food Banks.    The need is so great that the queues at Food Banks seem to be ever growing  so we decided to make it our priority to encourage the setup of more Food Banks in local areas.     To this end  we have now embarked on opening a Food Bank in Leyton E10. This will serve as a Food Bank  Soup Kitchen and a Distribution Hub as we continue to work with other organisations and Food Banks to cater for those in need.     As a community  in one of the world's richest countries  food poverty should never happen. COVID-19 has left individuals unemployed  feeling isolated  vulnerable and  as a result  hungry. Many people are embarrassed to say they have nothing to eat and with a 2nd lockdown now in place  we have already started to notice a spike in the number of people accessing Food Bank services once again.     Currently  we receive free perishable items 4 times a week but we would like to raise funds for non perishable items: pasta  rice  tin foods etc. which we can give to people in need for free. We are sure that you might have supported your local Food Bank in the past by donating items directly to them or putting extra items in the food trolleys at your local supermarket - this Gofundme initiative takes the hassle out of you purchasing the items and getting them to a Food Bank as we do the purchasing and if we are able to bulk purchase  then we will attract greater discounts from wholesalers which in turn means we can purchase and distribute more food items.     With Christmas coming up  no person or family should go hungry and we are asking for your support by making a donation to help us ensure that happens.     No amount is too small or too large  but £10 can contribute greatly to feeding an individual for a week.     Please support so that everyone can have a Merry Christmas!

Through the loss  the change  the upside down-ness  I’ve moved into a new season with God.    At the beginning of the pandemic in March the Lord clearly spoke to me and asked me to do an online Life Coaching course for a year. Having plenty of time on my hands and being stuck in the house I took this as a great opportunity and said YES.    My Journey So Far    I am a visionary that has been used mightily by God. In 2002 I set up and ran ‘Hospitality and Hope’  a charity for homeless and vulnerable people in South Tyneside. I did this on a voluntary basis for a total of 15 years. I spent these 15 years following God’s guidance step by step. I set up a soup kitchen  which then became a charity  which went on to become a foodbank  clothing bank  supported living accommodation et al. This all culminated in me receiving a British Empire medal from the Queen and the charity winning the Queen’s Award for voluntary service. You can see the video of my journey of faith below.    Unfortunately  as a result of working 80+ hours a week   I then became ill. I took time out to recuperate and find myself; I had lost myself in the work. I visited two Christian retreats and it was at these centres that I encountered the powerful way that creativity could be used in the healing process. God can speak through anything; pictures  poetry  woodwork  needlework  gardening and more.    My Creative Journey Begins    It became apparent that my time in the charity was over. God had me on the next part of my journey. I started a creative group called Come to the Table. This group met once a fortnight. We gathered around a large table to eat  talk  pray and create. It helped many people in different ways. Connection and creativity worked hand in hand to help and heal. However  when the lockdown happened it was no longer possible to meet like this.    Creativity and Coaching    The Lord spoke to me one Sunday when I was in church (prior to Covid) and told me to offer someone one to one creative sessions. I had never done these one to one creative sessions with anyone before and the Lord had to ask me three times before I said YES. Before the first session I was very nervous and had no idea what to do. But God gave me a download of exactly what I should do and I was amazed at how the creative sessions impacted my client’s life. Every session since  God has given me the exact creative activity to do and I have seen healing and freedom come from these sessions.    My online coaching course required me to find two people to practice with. Straight away it came to me to ask the person I had been doing creative one to one sessions with. She said YES. And so Creative Coaching was born in my life.    Both my clients have been helped enormously through this process. Both of them had previously been to see counsellors and clinical professionals. But creative coaching offered something new and different that helped them to become free.    In this I have seen God work through me to reach others with long term mental health issues. I stand amazed. By word of mouth I have other people interested in doing creative coaching. I know the Lord is using me in a mighty way.     What Next?    What I need now in order to proceed and help many more people is a studio to deliver Creative Coaching. A self contained  secure  comfortable and readymade creative environment where folk can come and feel safe and get individual attention.     The studio comes in parts and is moveable so it is future proof!    I believe the Lord asked me to set up a Go Fund Me page and gave me the specific target figure of £17 000 to cover; the cost of a studio with electrics and the remedial work like clearing the ground and laying a flat base. This is really stepping outside of my comfort zone. I have again given God my YES and wait to see what happens.    I now need help in pursuing the next stage of my journey  again helping people but this time using coaching and creativity. After spending 15 years volunteering for the charity (1 year paid)  I feel God is wanting me to make this my ministry. Yes  I will be making a charge for this service  but up until now I have given freely of my time. I will continue to do free sessions for those who can’t afford to pay.    I have seen the results that creative coaching has had and relish the opportunity to help many more people. I want to pursue what really matters; the opportunity to help rebuild people’s lives. Some have been stuck for many  many years. To see the effects that creative coaching is having is absolutely astounding. Only God could do this.    Why would you sow into this?    You would not only be sowing into my life by providing a space to work from but also be sowing into the lives of others who need help to walk into freedom. This is a unique opportunity for you to make a difference in someone else’s life. Will you give it your YES?    I will be making regular updates and hope to make a video of the studio site before  during and after.    Please watch the short films of two people's accounts of how creative coaching has impacted their lives.    Thank you.    Amelia      Creative Coaching Client recommendations:    1:1 Creative Coaching Sessions  I have now completed 5 coaching sessions with Amelia. Each session has been specifically designed to address the coaching focus in question  and in my case involves a creative activity.  I have been astounded by Amelia’s ability to produce relevant activities which help me to focus on  and talk through  the issues in question. The process of creating makes it easy to share with Amelia the sometimes emotional aspects of the issues I am addressing. It particularly helps me to identify how I am feeling and what I believe and think about an aspect of my life. This then enables me to address and change any wrong thinking. Throughout this process Amelia brings wisdom and presents challenge in a safe  calm environment. I would highly recommend Amelia as a coach.  Beth     Life Coaching  When I first started this life coaching course with Amelia I had very little expectation of it being able to help me. I have been a Christian for a long while and have sought help many times with little or no results ( except disappointment) . However I can honestly say that in the weeks that Amelia has been coaching me  my life has turned around. I am beginning to think differently and I am acting differently. Amelia doesn’t say very much but she does listen and gives me pointers to direct my thoughts and feelings in alignment with the word of God. The visual things she gets me to do  although simple  they have a great impact on me. I am so thankful to God for allowing me to do this course with such a spirit filled loving person who genuinely cares for the people she coaches.   Many  many  thanks to Amelia for all of the time and prayers that she puts into helping me and so many others.  Rosie    I want to make a difference  A Poem Written by Amelia E Luffrum    I want to make a difference  To everyone I meet  I want to make a difference  To people in the street.    I want to make a difference  To everyone I know  I want to make a difference  Everywhere I go.    I want to make a difference  To friends and loved ones too  I want to make a difference  Especially to you.    I want to make a difference  To show I really care  I want to make a difference  A moment just to share    I want to make a difference  In the things I do and say  I want to make a difference  In a positive way.    So if I’ve made a difference  In even the smallest way  Then you too can make a difference  In someone else’s day.      To find out more about my journey  take a look at the video below:    ",True

Our charity was established in 2012 when a group of local multicultural people took over an unused community centre in the heart of Pollok  Glasgow. Our aim was to make a positive contribution to the community  bring back old fashioned community spirit. We wanted locals to develop a sense of belonging and help make our neighbourhood feel safe again.       Eight years later and we have more than achieved that simple goal and are proud to be regarded to as the heart of the community and the go-to place for many from primary age children to pensioners. We and are constantly assessing the needs of the community and sourcing new ways to help support our local and wider community.          We currently provide:  – Foodshare Drop-in Centre (at our Community Centre)  – Foodshare on Wheels inc emergency parcels (Glasgow wide)  – Foodshare Pop-Ups (Glasgow wide)  – Children’s School Holiday Lunches (Every school holiday CCG opens the doors to feed children. They are provided with a snack  a healthy nutritious meal also a small box of cereal with a pint carton of milk for the next day.  – Independence from Foodbanks (cooking classes)  – Get Yourself Connected (wifi classes)  – Adult & Children language classes (7 languages)  – Youth Games & Movie Club  – General Drop-in Service  Coffee Mornings  – Volunteering  Training & Work Placement opportunities.  – Multi-Culture Fun Days    We have been under immense pressure in recent months with more people than ever requiring our help and support due to the financial uncertainty and struggles that many more people are experiencing due covid19. We have delivered thousands of hot meals and food packages to people that have been unable to leave home. None of this would have been possible without our fantastic local sponsors  Tesco  Silverburn  Asda  GHA  Arnold Clark to name a few. The same goes for the help of our local volunteers who selflessly give up their time to help others in need.       As much as we have some fantastic sponsors and volunteers  it is never enough. We always need more help  we can always do more. Even the smallest bit of help makes a massive difference. Something I have noticed recently is the amount of money we are spending on fuel costs. Many people that could normally come along to the food share  lunch clubs etc are no longer able to do so. The cost of reimbursing petrol money for our volunteers to deliver hot meals and necessities recently has risen vastly.       I am reaching to everyone  to ask to help CCG with any donations to help fill our food parcels. Any donations you could generously give would be greatly appreciated.

It is during this unprecedented time that we need to come together and do our share to help those impacted the most. We (Vik Mohith  Phil Tucker  Michael Brouder  Robert Palmer and Brian Macy) have decided to start this fundraising scheme on behalf of The Trussell Trust. As a result of the pandemic  families with little or no income  are falling behind and are struggling to provide themselves with the basics such as food. The Trussell Trust support a nationwide network of food banks and provide emergency food to those in need. Foodbank use has shown a steady increase over the last few years (Between April 2018 and March 2019  food banks in the Trussell Trust network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis  a 19% increase on the previous year) – the current pandemic will most likely increase the demand for these invaluable resources. We've come up with the idea of using a nomination system where we start with nominating 4 or more friends or colleagues to donate however much can be spared to the Trussell Trust. The nominees will each hopefully donate and/or nominate another 4 or more friends or colleagues who then do the same. This ripple effect will hopefully help us reach our goal. We absolutely appreciate that a donation may not be possible for everyone  but nominations will help spread the message of the good work the Trussell Trust do to those who may be able to help in a material way. Donations of food and essential non-food items such as toiletries and hygiene products can also be made at collection points in supermarkets across the country. We hope that you will join us on this journey in achieving this goal – together we can make a difference! Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to us.

Our best friend Alice and her partner Adam moved to Sri Lanka to work for a year back in 2018. Not long after arriving  Adam found a tiny kitten in the bushes where they were living and her mum was nowhere to be found. Alice and Adam took little Mo in and they enjoyed the rest of their year together.    When it was time for Alice and Adam to leave  they had always planned to wait until they were settled in their next home and have Mo brought over to them  wherever they were. For a number of reasons  Alice and Adam were both back in the UK as the Coronavirus pandemic was taking hold. Because of the pandemic  unfortunately Alice was made redundant from her job in travel and Adam has also found himself out of work. Despite both being unemployed  they have given up so much of their time to volunteer throughout the pandemic  managing their local mutual aid group and more recently helping out at a foodbank.    After a tough few months  Alice and Adam were ready to bring Mo over from Sri Lanka. They completed all the paperwork as required and arranged the logistics from the Sri Lankan end with the necessary contacts and organisations. On 3rd August  Mo started her long journey to her new home.    However  on arrival  it was found that the person sending Mo had not completed all the required paperwork which would have allowed Alice and Adam to take Mo home straight away.    Alice and Adam  who hadn't seen Mo for almost a year  were dealt a huge blow - Mo would have to be quarantined for four months. They would also have to pay a fine of £3400 for the error  which was not their fault  in addition to paying to put Mo in a cattery for the duration of her four-month quarantine. Their contact in Sri Lanka has refused to take any responsibility and pay the fine and is now ignoring their messages and emails.    Alice and Adam are devastated and we are devastated for them  and poor Mo. They have always worked so hard but have fallen on tough times as a result of the pandemic  as many others have. Living in London with no income and a huge fine to pay for a mistake they didn't make is causing our friends a huge amount of stress. A cuddle with Mo would make things a whole lot better  but they have a while to wait until she is home with them.
