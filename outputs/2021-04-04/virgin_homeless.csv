,"Hodgkinson House,200 New London Road  Chelmsford,Essex  CM2 9AB","CHESS Homeless","CHESS Homeless seeks to ensure that those that find themselves homeless in Essex are supported in ways that enable them to move forward purposefully and in good health. CHESS currently operates a direct access 9 bedroom shelter in Chelmsford, providing a safe enviroment and services, including a bedroom, hygiene/laundry facilities, home cooked meals and drinks.  During the Covid pandemic we changed this property to a self sufficient 4 bedroom property which operates 24/7, to enable self isoloation if required. CHESS also provides 7 other properties including an annex to the shelter which serve as a further step towards independent living. This in turn means we can house up to 42 individuals in total currently. We aim to further increase this so we can accommodate up to 64 individuals at any one time. Not having access to everyday essentials and services makes it difficult for those experiencing homelessness to sustain relationships, employment and contribute to society. They often come from chaotic backgrounds with complex needs. Many CHESS Service Users have had the additional trauma of rough sleeping and health related issues. Not having any structure to their day makes it extremely hard for them to gain control of their lives, which can have a detrimental effect on their health, leading to addiction, depression and poorer physical well-being. Once enrolled into the CHESS Change Programme, residents are assigned to a Support Worker who works with the individual to indentify causes of homelessness and address issues they may be facing.  They will assist them with registering with local services, and ultimately securing more permanent accommodation. We offer a professional counselling service, and refer to other providers to help them with any problems they have that empowers them to move on in their lives. We offer certificated training courses providing qualifications that could lead to employment. We also run a Winter Project between November and March, offering 10 emergency beds and breakfast to rough sleepers. Alongside this our Outreach Team will support any rough sleepers referred via Streetlink, covering Chelmsford, Maldon, Braintree, Rochford and Epping. We provide sleeping bags, warm clothes and snacks, with the possibility of temporary accommodation at our Shelter for emergency cases.",False,2021-03-07,"2021-03-31 20/2021-03-31 5/2021-03-31 25/2021-03-30 10/2021-03-30 25/2021-03-30 50/2021-03-30 20/2021-03-30 5/2021-03-29 10/2021-03-29 10/2021-03-28 5/2021-03-28 10/2021-03-27 5/2021-03-27 100/2021-03-27 5/2021-03-27 5/2021-03-27 15/2021-03-26 30/2021-03-26 5/2021-03-26 15/2021-03-26 10/2021-03-25 50/2021-03-24 50/2021-03-24 5/2021-03-23 20/2021-03-21 50/2021-03-20 5/2021-03-20 10/2021-03-19 20/2021-03-19 20/2021-03-19 5/2021-03-19 15/2021-03-19 5/2021-03-18 20/2021-03-18 50/2021-03-10 20/2021-03-09 30/2021-03-08 10/2021-03-08 30/2021-03-07 10/2021-03-07 10/2021-03-07 20/2021-03-07 10/2021-03-07 30/2021-03-07 10/2021-03-07 50/2021-03-07 10/2021-03-07 10/2021-03-07 5/2021-03-07 5",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=rosiew&pageUrl=7,2021-03-31,,,1035

Where will the money go?  All the funds you raise will contribute towards helping vulnerable young people who are either homeless or faced with homelessness find a safe place to live, receive support when they need it and have someone to turn to when they feel they have nowhere else to go. Most of all, you’ll be giving them hope and a real opportunity for a positive future.       ",False,2020-02-10,"2020-12-18 250/2020-12-09 15/2020-12-01 20/2020-11-04 85/2020-10-06 160/2020-09-22 10/2020-09-17 10/2020-06-25 10/2020-04-30 5/2020-04-30 10/2020-04-29 5/2020-04-29 15/2020-04-27 15/2020-02-24 45/2020-02-10 70/2020-02-10 41",https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=UnoCharityOfTheYear&pageUrl=1,2020-12-18,"Throughout London",,771
,"c/o Crisis Skylight,66 Commercial Street  London,London  E1 6LT","Vision Care For Homeless People","Vision Care for Homeless People is a charity set-up to provide free eye care services to homeless and other vulnerable people in an accessible and friendly environment in which they feel safe, welcome and comfortable. WHAT WE DO: We preserve, protect and promote the ocular health of homeless and vulnerable people in the UK. We carry out a fully comprehensive eye examination and provide spectacles all totally free of charge. Homeless people are more vulnerable than the general population. They have a higher risk of being assaulted or having property stolen, so spectacles might be lost or broken beyond repair. By providing this service we help thousands of people see a brighter future. We currently have nine clinics, details of which can be found here. Do sign up to receive our bi-monthly newsletter here. OUR GOAL: Our goal is to expand our services so that by 2022 we can reach 40% of the UK's homeless people and ensure that they have access to regular eye care and the provision of spectacles so that they can enjoy the gift of sight. THE CHALLENGE: To meet our ambitious goal we need to raise £1.5 million by 2022 to ensure we have the ability to not only continue providing our current high level of service but to expand our capabilities and offer help to the many thousands of people that desperately need it. WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP: We know there are lots of people in the UK who wish they could give us that money all in one go, but we recognise that not everyone can, so we're asking everyone to help us out by giving us something small that you can afford so that together we do great things. A pound may not seem like much but if everyone in the UK gave us just a single pound each we would have enough money to run our service and match our ambitions for many years to come. We also welcome those seeking to help us in other ways. We've previously had people perform sponsored runs, bike rides and even bungee jumps for us so we're always open to new and innovative ways for people to raise support for the charity!
