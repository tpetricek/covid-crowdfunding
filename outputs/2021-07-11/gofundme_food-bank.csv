" Thank you High Peak Food Bank and Zink Project ","Buxton, East Midlands, United Kingdom",https://www.gofundme.com/f/thank-you-high-peak-food-bank-and-zink-project,500,150,2021-06-30,2021-06-22,"THE ZINK PROJECT CIO","Registered nonprofitDonations eligible for Gift Aid.",4,"2021-06-30 100/2021-06-28 20/2021-06-24 10/2021-06-22 20","I first came in to contact with Zink in September last year. Having had a mental breakdown and suicide attempt I was struggling mentally and financially. I went to the food bank and while there I had a mini breakdown. This is when I met [Zink Advice Worker] Julie. Julie was extremely easy to talk to and quickly gained my trust to be able to talk to her. She helped me sort through piles of paperwork  speaking to people about bills and debts  getting me to speak to the right people to help me and being there when I just needed to talk. Since September I have been diagnosed with autism and the biggest problem I had was a debt to my landlord of over £4000 for which they had an eviction order. Julie was instrumental in helping me get a court hearing where the eviction was suspended. Julie's knowledge was brilliant and made we aware of funds/benefits available to me and because of this in under nine months I have been able to pay off (through myself and funds) the entire arrears and have the eviction set aside. For the first few months I was also reliant on the food bank side while my money git sorted.  I cannot thank Julie (and Zink and high peak food bank) enough for the last nine months. Without her and them I certainly wouldn't be in as good a position as I am now - mentally  financially and emotionally.   I want to give back and as I am not working I don't have the means to give what I want.   This is my thank you. Please help me so that they can continue to help people back on their feet the way they have helped me.   In addition to this I have had some lovely people on here and B and Q donate materials for making a mosaic and Buxton Woodwork  Buxton building supplies and Markovitz have all donated enough materials for me to make around six bird tables and several bird boxes. These will be being sold and auctioned off by Zink/food bank for some more money for them.   Thank you in advance as I say thanks to them",False

We are raising money to secure a central fulfilment centre so that we can centralise our efforts in reaching and providing out services daily.    We want to secure a space to not only cook and provide our meals but also provide a safe space where children can come and eat a warm meal and receive support and advice about life  from education to well being support.   What we need?  With lockdown easing and support for families also easing we want to ensure that families do not face the fear of not being able to feed their children.

" Help me have a life. ","Norwich, East of England, United Kingdom",https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-andy-get-a-wheelchair,0,10000,,2021-05-27,,,0,,"4 years ago I was struck down with a very rare illness. Its a form or autoimmune arthritis that has destroyed my body and left me disabled literally overnight. It continues to destroy my joints every day but thanks to medication it has been slowed down a bit. Then  last year  to make matters worse  I caught a form of coronovirus that put me in hospital for 2 months. I spent 3 weeks in a coma on a lung bypass machine. I very nearly died and at more than one occasion my wife was told to prepare for the worst and was told that I had about a 10% chance of survival. I lived but I have been left with severe lung damage. I have lost about 40% of my lung function and now require oxygen constantly.   So now I need a wheelchair to go anywhere that requires walking a distance and oxygen too.   I have been left with other side effects of the coronovirus and the arthritis causes a lot more issues than just my joints but it would take an age to list them all and describe them too so I will just say that I am f*#*Ed.   I have a wife  3 boys and a granddaughter and I'm only 45 so it's like my life has been taken away from me far too soon as I miss out on so much. I can't have a kick around with my son  I struggle with chess. I can't teach my youngest how to ride his bike. My life really sucks. Life on the pittance of benefits we get is terrible. Food banks help and there are many other groups out there that help out too but we never have any money to be able to have any decent standard of life. So please put your hand in your pocket and help me and my family out. Help me out so I can get a decent  working wheelchair. Help us out so that maybe we could have a dream family holiday. Help us out so we can get our house decorated. Jobs that I was going to do but now I can't. Help us out so we can get our garden sorted out. The list goes on and on of things I wanted to do but can't anymore. Please just help us out. ",True

Like many I've had a tough life but more so my boys have had a really tough life. They have been through domestic violence  constant moving and poverty. Up until July 2019 I was working as an operations manager and medic for a private ambulance company but due to mental health issues I had to leave. Since then both my boys and my partner have lost their jobs due to covid. I currently have a Notice of possession from my housing for rent arrears. We are going to food banks every week. I suffer with anxiety  depression and high blood pressure. I had a Tia (mini stroke) in November 2018 and am currently going through tests to confirm if I have fibromyalgia due to being in pain everyday. My family have helped as much as they can  my partner (who has just been diagnosed with Copd) and my boys help and support me mentally and physically  my boys are my life  my eldest hs depression and my other has ADHD/Aspergus. I just want them to feel safe and secure for once in their lives. I have begged and pleaded borrowed more than I can pay back  sold anything and everything I physically can and now have bailiffs at my door. I know there are people in much worse situations than we are but I'm at a point of desperation and thought  why not  everyone else does it  you never know.....just want to be able to pay my rent this month Thanks for reading guys xx ",True

It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has launched to support our community and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.  The Lambeth Food Bank Fund   Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.   In Lambeth we have a history of looking after one another - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.   So we are creating something called the Lambeth Food Bank Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.   Our borough has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has been set up for us to help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.   Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Lambeth. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.     * * *   FAQs  What can I do?  Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the most vulnerable.   Where will the funds go?  The funds will go to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by Holy Trinity Clapham and delivered to food banks across the borough - including Brixton & Norwood  Clapham Park  Vauxhall  and Waterloo - that can help the most vulnerable.   If I do donate will it go to those who need it?   Yes  your donation will go to those who need it. Unlike other platforms  GoFundMe do not charge a fundraising fee although they take a small transaction fee. See here for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to.   I want to help my local community  will this money be spent in Lambeth?   Yes.   Where can I find accurate information about covid-19?   For general information on CV-19  please visit the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response  Lambeth Council have some useful information: https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/elections-and-council/about-lambeth/coronavirus-covid-19-information  If you are worried about your own health  call the NHS on 111.

GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw Since We Care was launched as the UK's largest independent food bank and advice and support hub in Lewisham in 2014  we have always ensured that  during school holidays and Christmas  children and the hungry families they come from do not have to worry about putting food on the table. This half term  however  and over this coming Christmas  we truly need your help to feed the new wave of people and pets from across London who are in crisis and will be coming through our doors this winter at Kath's Place  50 Friendly Street  Deptford SE8 4DR.    Can you imagine losing up to 40% of your monthly income? That is the reality for so many people in the present crisis. Rents are so high in our area that people in work do not have enough cash to pay the rent and  probably for the first time in their lives  are having to trade a visit to their local coffee shop for a visit to the We Care Food Bank and Food Pantry for help  advice  support and solidarity. Embarrased and even ashamed  but even more desperate and distraught that their kids are going hungry  mums tell us that they can go days without food  and  on average  it takes people at least a week of going hungry before they finally come through our doors and ask for help. We really do need your donation this Christmas GoFundMe https://gf.me/u/x8m3fw . Becasue we help everyone and anyone and do not focus on one particular group (such as refugees or the homeless) we get absolutely NO national or local government funding or any other type of funding.

This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased our costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries.

A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems. Barrow Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. There has never been a more crucial time to help those who are less fortunate than us - which is why I have organised this event.     The Covid-19 effect   Well before Covid-19 hit the UK  food banks in the Trussell Trust network had been seeing year-on-year increases in levels of need  with 1.9 million emergency food parcels given out in 2019/20. As Covid-19 hit the UK  the Trussell Trust saw an immediate and sustained surge in need across its food banks. In April there was an 89% increase in the number of emergency food parcels given out compared with the same month in 2019. This included a 107% increase in the number of parcels given to children  compared to the same period last year. New findings show that almost 100 000 households received support from a food bank in the Trussell Trust network for the very first time between April and June 2020. It's no secret that the pandemic has had a significant impact on people's jobs and finances - increasing the use of foodbanks nationwide.     What are we doing?   Since March 2020  many people (including myself) have adopted a new hobby in running. Whether it is to pass time  get out of the house  keep fit whilst the gyms are closed or a tool to manage your mental health. Everyone has their individual reasons for running and it would be fantastic to use this as an opportunity to help and support our local foodbank through completing a half marathon challenge (13.1 miles or 21.09 kilometres).     When?  Those who are taking part will complete the run on either Friday 23rd April  Saturday 24th April or Sunday 25th April - uploading their run to the page when complete.     Donations  There is a group target amount of £1 000 and every penny donated is hugely appreciated. However  I am conscious of the financial difficulties that many people face due to the current situation  therefore  it is absolutely fine if you are unable to donate - you can always share this page instead!

It’s crazy how the pandemic we currently living in has caused all kinds of financial difficulties situations and families have had no choice but to turn to the food banks for help and assistance. I know that raising money will help the food bank buy essential food. It saddens me to see how the numbers have doubled as more people are being impacted by COVID-19 with job losses and furlough leaving families struggling to find money to buy enough food. We have all seen the headlines regarding school meals but it's easy to forget for a lot of these children that is the only balanced meal they will get. In the first six months of the pandemic  some food banks in the United Kingdom gave out a staggering 1.2 million emergency food parcels. That’s one food parcel every 13 seconds  and 2 600 of these went to children every day on average. I decided to walk 2021 km and hopefully get this achieved within 10 months. So if you see me walking please give me a cheer and some motivational comments. Every penny helps put food on the table and allowing families to try not stress financially or have to choose between food and heating. So please consider donating to a worthy cause.    So I'm looking for your support. Together we can make a difference.  ",False

Many individuals and families have suffered additional hardship during this period and demand for foodbank services has increased significantly over this time and continues to rise. The ending of the furlough scheme at the end of October is likely to result in this demand increasing further as more people are unfortunately likely to be made redundant.    The foodbank at Danebury Drive has been run since the start of lockdown by one individual from her own front garden. Initially this was on a small scale helping a number of local families  but has grown significantly to the point where currently 50 food parcels are produced weekly with an addition 75 individuals access the food on offer for collection for themselves and families.    As a result  the foodbank has become a valuable resource for families on the North and East sides of Acomb. This is one of a network of community foodbanks set up across the city who are all working together to share resources best they can.    The onset of winter means that to continue premises need to found as running this outside with no cover will no longer be viable. Premises have been found at a local church with the offer of a peppercorn rent. In addition to rent funding will be required to cover rent and fuel costs    The foodbank currently receives a significant amount of food donations from Co-op  Fareshare and Morrisons amongst others which is mainly of items such as bread and non-perishable items. Whilst the support has been amazing  this rarely provides sufficient fresh items to support the need  hence the additional purchase of such items mentioned above. Clearly such nutritional items are required for an individual to have a balanced diet  made more important by the fact that many children are supported by the bank.    Up to date the £250pw for fresh items has been covered by a weekly £200pw purchase of produce by a local charity (Kitchen for Everyone York) with the additional made up by the small amount of monetary donations received at the foodbank. However  the current level of support from Kitchen for Everyone cannot be maintained and their support has dropped to £100pw due to a shortage of funding. This level of funding will be continued until the end of 2020.    The costs of powering the fridge freezers and fuel for collection has been borne by the individual running the bank  but this cannot be maintained.    Your help is requested to help continue the service that has been so invaluable for the local community  especially as there are concerns that demand is more likely to increase in the short term rather than decline.",False

Its a distance of 25 miles which will take me over Pen-y-ghent  Whernside and Ingleborough which are some rather big hills! The money I raise will be split evenly between the two charities and I am hoping to reach a target of 1000 which will hopefully go a long way in supporting people in need around Doncaster.       In 2019 I had been suffering with depression for a number of years but eventually sought professional help and it genuinely transformed my life and has given me a whole new outlook and purpose. I was fortunate to have the support of my family and friends when I truly needed it most. I was also able to pay for the help I needed  but not everyone is that lucky. That's why 50% of what we raise will go to MIND mental health charity  because they offer a free counselling service to people who need it most  who sometimes don't have that support bubble.   Doncaster Food Bank work tirelessly all year round and depend on the generosity of our community to do what they do. So I want to do my part to help as I don't believe anyone should go hungry or not be able to feed their families. Any of us could depend on a charity like this one day  you never know.    Any donation you can make would honestly be very appreciated.   Thank you! ",False

Now  the normal response for the owner of a business like this would be to take advantage of rate relief  seek bridge funding for the business and also look for financial support being offered to people that are self-employed.    But not Ziggy...        Ziggy has converted the Barbershop into a Food Bank that is specifically focused on helping the elderly and other vulnerable members of the local community to have access to the food and sustenance they need in a time when it may be challenging to make trips to supermarkets or go shopping themselves.    We all know that local businesses like barbershops are massive pillars within communities as they are connected to so many people and aware of a range of local issues. So  who better and where better for a Food Bank to support vulnerable people to come from?

Now  we need your support more than ever.    Due to massive demand and the end of the lease on our current Warehouse we are moving to a brand new home that will help us increase our capacity and speed up our operations  helping us to continue to put food donated by the community straight into the hands of those who need it.     This is an exciting chapter in Canterbury Food Bank’s history  and a brilliant opportunity for us to grow and change in response to new challenges. But it is also an expensive chapter; our previous premises were occupied on a peppercorn lease of £10 a month  so by paying the market rate for a suitable property our rental costs have been multiplied 133 times.     We are asking our community to help us raise a year of rent - £16 000 - up front so that all other funds can be used to buy and deliver food. Please donate and share this appeal widely to secure the future of the Food Bank as a key charity in the district.     PRESS RELEASE -    Canterbury Food Bank today launched a campaign to help pay for its new building - after its rent multiplied 133 times.     The charity is moving to another warehouse  specially converted to suit its needs  because the lease on its current premises has come to an end.    CFB had been paying a peppercorn rent of £10 a month for the old building  but will now have to pay market rate of £16 000 a year.     Its Raise the Rent campaign aims to cover the rental costs so that all other funds can be used to buy and deliver food. The new  bigger warehouse  near Whitstable  secures the future of CFB as a key charity in the district.     Demand in the past 12 months has at times more than trebled year-on-year and in December it provided enough food to make more than 10 000 meals.     The economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 crisis  and the uncertainty of Brexit  are the main reasons behind the spike.    The charity has signed a five-year lease on the 3 780 square foot  two storey warehouse  which will be used to store donations of food and as an office.     CFB chair Martin Ward said: “We’re pleased and relieved to have secured our long-term future at a time when our services have never seen such high demand.     “It has become clear over the past year that  even more than ever  a backstop is needed to help those who can not afford food.     “We are that backstop and it is our intention to remain so for as long as we are required.     “These are difficult times for many people and we ask the public to help us support those most in need.”    CFB provides emergency three-day food parcels to individuals and families in financial need across Canterbury  Whitstable  Herne Bay and surrounding villages.    It has donation baskets in all leading supermarkets including Sainsbury’s  Tesco  Asda and Morrisons  where people can leave dried or tinned food items. ",False

That’s because the cost of purchasing the food their users need far exceeds their operating budget from donations.   But canned goods are not enough. says food banks like Margate Independent Foodbank desperately need financial donations too  for several reasons. The first is to pay running costs to run the operation. “There’s a whole infrastructure that’s required to make sure  beyond just receiving the donation  that food is safely processed and distributed into our community ” he says. Money is also a good donation option because the vast amount of food donations arrive between November and Christmas  and having cash on hand helps them buy food during the remaining months  since people are hungry year-round. It also helps them buy supplies to meet specific clients’ needs  such as culturally appropriate foods. In addition  food banks are able to look for discounts and purchase food at wholesale  which means they are able to get more out of that Pound than a person shopping retail probably could.   ",False

Thousands of people are suddenly out of work and literally cannot put food on the table.    According to the Trussell Trust’s data  families with children have been hit the hardest by the pandemic and over 1.2 million food parcels were given out to people during the crisis by the Trust from 1st April to 30th September 2020. The Trust estimates that a further 670 000 people will be getting into poverty in 2021 where they will not be able to afford essentials like food and energy utilities.    More people have now died from coronavirus in the second wave than the first wave. In the UK to date  a total of 97 329 people have died due to the pandemic and over 3.62 million people have been infected and the numbers are rising.     According to the Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance  the new variant of the virus spreads between 30% and 70% faster than others and hence it is 30% more deadly (BBC). It is now mandatory to use face masks in various indoor settings as per the UK government guidelines. (GOV.UK)    When people cannot afford to put food in their mouths how could they afford to buy a face mask to cover their mouths?    IT IS TIME TO ACT NOW AND DO SOMETHING TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE NEW VIRUS VARIANT!    With the support of GoFundMe  I have started the campaign   “Face Masks 4 Foodbanks” to help provide face masks to foodbanks which they will distribute to their users.     Your donations will be spent on buying face masks at supplier’s cost price which will be donated to the hundreds of families who get food parcels from the following food banks.     1. Newham Foodbank  2. Tower Hamlets Foodbank - Firstlove Foundation   3. Ealing Foodbank  4. Hackney Foodbank  5. Brent Foodbank  6. Hounslow Community FoodBox  7. Bow Food Bank - Newham  8.

Together  let’s stop the spread of COVID-19 and ease the pressure on our NHS services. I hope the people of the UK will continue to show their kindness  compassion and generosity during these unprecedented times and with your donation  we can win the battle of the unseen enemy COVID-19.

During the last 9 months we have also managed community events (socially distanced of course). For the VE Day bank holiday  we adapted our plans for a fun day and instead ran a house decorating competition (please look at our FB page for a vast array of photos). We have also has an Easter trail and a Halloween Trail. We also have colouring competitions that are open to all ages- adults included.    We are also planning a socially distanced ‘wonder tour’ with Father Christmas. The big man will sit in a sleigh and wave to all the children on their doorsteps. He is also posting out letters to the children (and we believe some of the adults will be getting their naughty letters too).    We are working hard to make the current pandemic as enjoyable as possible and any support you can give to this fundraiser would be absolutely appreciated.

100/2020-04-12 10/2020-04-12 20","THANKS FOR VISITING MY FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN TO SAVE THE SUN NEWSPAPER AFTER THEY REPORTED A £201M LOSS AND THE COMPANY'S VALUE WAS ADJUSTED TO ZERO!    Throughout this Coronavirus crisis  Britain's most-loved newspaper has been under threat. Declining sales and advertising revenue could consign this shining example of journalistic standards to a terrible fate  and it's time that we stood up and took a stand.    The Sun was already suffering a financial crisis before Covid-19 even took hold ...      However  things have now become desperate for this historically blemish-free institution of British publishing with their very own Dan Wootton encouraging everyone to buy a copy and keep them in business - it does cost less than a cup of coffee after all.      Instead of just merely buying a copy to keep them in business  I want to take things further.    I will take every penny that is donated to this fundraising campaign and every day I will use it to buy copies of The Sun from my local store  and then deliver them absolutely free of charge to homes in my local area in South Essex. If other people follow my lead and set up their own fundraising campaigns  we could send their circulation through the roof in a matter of days!    IMPORTANT NOTE: During the lockdown  it's taking ages to get my kids to bed every night  and usually by the time they have settled down my local Sainsbury's is closed. If this happens on any particular day  I will donate the money to local food banks instead.    ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: I don't like rain  so if it is raining on any particular day I will donate any money collected to local food banks instead.    YET ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: I don't like sun or wind either  so if it is sunny or windy on any particular day I will donate any money collected to local food banks instead. I'm not fond of clouds either.    ONE FURTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: We should all be staying at home as much as possible at the moment to protect the NHS and save lives  and so if I think that there may be any people out and about in the United Kingdom at the same time as me on any particular day I will remain at home and donate any money collected to local food banks instead.    ONE MORE VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: If you actually think that I am giving that sh*t rag a single penny of this instead of donating the money to local food banks  you're very much mistaken.    Any questions? I'm on Facebook at Man Behaving Dadly - https://facebook.com/manbehavingdadly    ONE ABSOLUTELY VITAL NOTE THAT HAS BEEN DRAFTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MY ADVISORS    All money raised will be distributed to local food banks  and not given to The Sun  Rupert Murdoch  Rupert Bear  or indeed anyone other than local food banks.",False

The blasts in Beirut  were pretty devastating  but the important news in all this was that more than 6 000 people were injured  plus 150 killed  dozens still missing to this hour as rescue teams search for them  & hundreds of homes & people’s livelihoods were shattered  rendering nearly 3000 homeless.     As a result  Beirut has been declared a disaster striken city.     With the port -- Lebanon's economical lifeline -- totally destroyed   food shortages will spike & many families will go without.Already  Lebanon was suffering from massive food & fuel shortages  and now it will not be able to import anything. Bleak  darker days for hundreds of thousands of people lie ahead!     This is urgent.     Lebanon needs you now.    Please donate so we can ensure people have a place to stay safe  food to eat & the means to survive & overcome this catastrophe.    Pray for lebanon ...    Your help is more needed than ever     Your donations will help contribute to:    -hospital bills  -small repairs  -Buy basic food items to put together food parcels for many who will have nothing to eat today and in many more days to come.   -Life saving medications for those in need & unable to afford those.We need to help those on the ground with whatever means we can.    Help us help people   we beg you!         ___________________________________      Half the population are living in abject poverty.     People are dying  not from Covid  but from starvation  lack of medication and healthcare.    The economy  currency and banking system have failed. Inflation has been the final blow. Many in work have not been paid for months and others have lost their job and cannot feed their families or pay the rent.     Callers from across Lebanon have been begging for help on the programme “Sahtak Bill Dinyeh ” (your health is worth the world) on Sawt al Ghad radio .    Helped by many charitable people  the programme’s host Dory Nasr has distributed food  medicine and basic necessities.        Now the warehouse is empty.      Lebanese around the world and those sympathetic to the country’s plight can help by donating what they can. Every penny helps  paying for baby milk  food  medicine and housing.    Hala and Dana  two British-Lebanese expats  decided to kickstart this fundraiser to help secure both continuity and replenishment of the food bank. This is a much needed lifeline  without which many families will be doomed with both hunger and displacement.       Le Liban est au bord de l’effondrement total.    La moitié de la population vit dans une pauvreté extrême.    Les gens meurent  non pas de Covid  mais de faim  de manque de médicaments et de soins de santé.    L'économie  la monnaie et le système bancaire ont échoué. L'inflation a été le coup de grâce. Beaucoup d’employés n'ont pas reçu leurs salaires depuis des mois et d'autres ont perdu leur emploi et ne peuvent plus nourrir leurs familles  payer le loyer ou acheter des medicaments vitaux.    Les appelants de part et d’autre du Liban ont imploré l'aide sur l'émission «Sahtak Bill Dinyeh» (votre santé vaut le monde) sur la radio Sawt al Ghad .    Avec l’aide de nombreuses personnes charitables  l’animateur du programme  Dori Nasr  a distribué de la nourriture  des médicaments et des produits de première nécessité.

The Project /Building Purley Masjid​    Purley Masjid is a modern Islamic community centre in a suburb of South London  Purley. It was established in 2015 after fund raising to accommodate the needs of the local Muslim community.    Ma Sha’ Allah  the Masjid is now trying to cope with the demand and has to overcome many challenges to support the Muslim and also non-Muslim community. Here are just a few of examples of the issues:     We have one main hall which accommodates only 200 people for an average Jumu’ah congregation of over 400.      People often have to wait outside in the forecourt for the second Jamaat     Current facilities for ladies accommodates around 30  whereas the demand is known to be in excess of 150. This is severely restricting our ability to meet current demand for women     Our lectures  Fitness Classes  Mother and Toddlers group  daily iftaris in Ramadhan and seniors meet up sessions all take place on the same carpeted area on which we pray. This is not ideal and as we are effectively operating out of one hall  it means that we can only have one activity happening at any given time     The Food Bank only has enough space for a shelf rack to store food. It caters for anyone in need in the Purley community  Muslim and non-Muslim alike        By the Grace of Allah swt we have embarked on the Building Purley Masjid project that will cater for the needs of the community. The project will result in a new Masjid on the current Purley Masjid site and will be a modern  purpose built building for the community spanning 6 floors that will include:     Two male prayer halls with a combined capacity of 500     A ladies prayer hall with capacity of over 200 and crèche facilities      A multi purpose hall     A dedicated lecture/events hall (we held over 100 last year)  which can accommodate 100 people     Improved facilities for our already existing Youth Activities  Mother and Toddlers Group and Seniors Group     Separate classrooms for our Madrasah classes      More space for our weekly Food Bank  ​​    We already have all these activities running at Purley Masjid but are struggling to meet demands and keep up the excellent level of service we provide.",False

Since we were founded 10 months ago  we have continued to support local schools and their families with vital food packages. This is something that is really important to us as we have come to realise how many people are struggling in the county and have been shocked by it. We have built a fantastic relationship with local schools and knowing we are doing something for these young people and their families is very rewarding. As well as schools we have provided food packages to the Northamptonshire community mental health team  'leaving care': an organisation for individuals who are leaving the care system  HM probation services  local community groups as well as many families or vulnerable individuals who have reached out for support.     The McCarthy-Dixon foundation started initially as an emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a food bank and food delivery service. We have quickly broadened our services after realising the scope of both poverty and hardship in the local area. The community has always been at the heart of what we do and this means we will change and adapt to what the community needs.",False

Every week we take the money you have kindly donated to a cash and carry and buy  in bulk  what the four food banks we are working with have told us they desperately need. (See pics below). This is complemented by a weekly visit to the Felix Project where we load up with fresh fruit  veg  meat  eggs and cheese. All of this is delivered to community kitchens who cook up meals for those most in need in W10.    We are currently working with The Dalgarno Trust   Bay 20   The Space and The Tabernacle . All four of these charities provide meals  bags of shopping and many other support services to those experiencing food poverty in W10. Kensington and Chelsea boasts some of the highest net worth inhabitants but also has many pockets of severe deprivation – North Kensington is one of the deepest. A sobering fact to note is that 31.6% of children in this borough live in poverty.    Food banks we are working alongside unanimously concur that the demand for aid has tripled this year since the pandemic began. Help is needed more than ever. Every time we make a drop  the relief and joy the charities express is palpable and sums up how desperate the situation is.    All the money donated will be used to supply fruit  veg and essentials to those in need in North Kensington. Your financial donations will go entirely towards funding this food relief project. All staff  including Rima  Amanda  Maryam and the admin  safeguarding and marketing support team are volunteers.     Please share this page with anyone who might be interested in helping and please donate if you would like to help. A regular donation would make a huge difference  as food poverty is not going to go away.    Thank you for your invaluable support.    Rima  Maryam  Amanda and team.    How to contact us:  Email: [email redacted]  Instagram: stjohnscafe    Call Rima: 07891 078 647    Or Amanda 07956 282 858    How it started: In March when the pandemic closed the doors of Rima’s Café at the Playground Theatre  she and her son Mars created a GoFundMe page to raise money for a Covid19 food relief campaign. Over the course of 11 weeks  they raised £16 000. With the help of a team of local volunteers producing over 6000 meals  all of which were delivered to those most in need in the North Ken community.     The last campaign attracted a lot of attention with publicity in newspapers both local and national  RBK&C Mayor Gerard Hargreaves came to visit and recently in October this year Rima was on Radio 5 Live discussing food poverty and school meals.

Free Meals  Full Hearts is designed to bridge that gap and ensure that if your situations changes quickly  or you just need a little help - we're here for you. Anonymously.    I have heard some truly eye opening stories since creating this charitable group - everything from families only eating one meal a day and a couple who hadn't had a hot meal in days to another family who had literally only eaten canned beans and hoops for 10 days solidly because their weekly food budget was £9 to feed 5. It really does put life in perspective.    No-one in our community should go hungry. Ever.    The Reading community has shown time and time again that when faced with challenges or adversities  we come together. The camaraderie  generosity and positivity around us every day is overwhelming.    Feeding yourself and your family is a basic but essential human necessity but unfortunately far too many people in the Reading area are skipping meals and going hungry because they simply can't afford to eat. I can only imagine this must be particularly heartbreaking if you're a parent who is unable to feed your children. As momentum has increased and more and more people have heard about Free Meals  Full Hearts and we occasionally find ourselves struggling to help due to lack of physical food donations. When this happens  I either dip into the reserve pot or sometimes  out of my own pocket i'll buy emergency food shops for families (between £30-£50 per week depending on the size of the family).

As a school  family is important to us  this year has been tough for so many different reasons and the pressures of this current climate are visible to all to see.    Many people have lost their jobs because of the virus  there has been a surge in the number of people becoming homeless and without food.    Being the community school we are  its only right that we are at the forefront of ‘building our community for our community’ we are doing this by setting up a food bank to provide food and essential items for our most vulnerable young people and families within our school and wider community.      More than 2.3 million Londoners live below the poverty line and 33% of adults have skipped meals to save money so that their children can eat.      The Charter School North Dulwich Go fund me page will help us to raise money to purchase food for our most vulnerable young people and families. During the festive period food was donated to the Southwark central community hub.     Our donations page will be ongoing after the new year and all throughout the academic school year and beyond     Food parcels are available on request.

Update: 3rd March  2021    Another interview with The Independent  describing the struggle to survive on Universal Credit and my fears about the cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/budget/budget-universal-credit-20-pounds-b1811750.htmlTaking this opportunity to thank everyone for their ongoing support - you are wonderful and I couldn't do this without you.   .  .  .      Update: 19th January  2021 I've been interviewed by The Independent about the catastrophic consequences of the upcoming Universal Credit cut. www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/b1789040.html      .  .  .        My original message: 30th August  2019    This is incredibly difficult for me to write  but I need to ask my friends  acquaintances and perhaps even some people whom I don’t know  to help me get through the next few months.    I am a domestic abusive survivor struggling to meet essential living costs and the situation is going to escalate rapidly because my employer is deducting more than 25% of my pay from September onwards  to recover two overpayments they made in error for a really long time  without me or payroll noticing.    I’m already on a low income and have been trying to find a more stable job. Until now I’ve been working two jobs  but the temporary one is coming to an end and I will only have my permanent part-time job – where they have persistently tried to dismiss me on health grounds so aside from the overpayment recovery  I just can’t hold on there for much longer.    Whenever I do give my notice or get dismissed  they’ll take the entirety of my final month’s pay.    I live alone but the person I used to cohabit with left substantial utility bill debts at our home that I didn’t become aware of until later  since they lied about having cleared balances. There’s not enough space to move another person in  and I can’t move out right now for financial and contractual reasons.    Because of an active police investigation for rape and domestic abuse that I can’t go into  I’ve already borrowed money for unexpected costs like home security  numerous phone calls to charities and agencies offering professional advice  and private therapy which unfortunately I had to quit.    My chronically poor health has dramatically worsened – I’ve been to a&e twice in the past fortnight because of a kidney infection that didn’t respond to treatment and I had to pawn things to pay for my ongoing prescriptions  but there’s not much of value left for me to sell.    I need to wear glasses but have been doing without for several months since they broke; I’m doing without a lot of things. One of my cats needs dental surgery soon but this isn’t going to be possible.    I earn slightly too much to claim benefits or get free prescriptions and despite years of hospital referrals  I am still fighting for a diagnosis to explain my physical health problems so I’m not currently eligible for any support that could be claimed.    Unfortunately I’m estranged from my parents and I don’t have regular contact with any other family.    I don’t have savings and I wouldn’t realistically be able to repay any further money borrowed.    Up to this point I’ve managed to keep on top of the rent and buy cat food but I have now begun going without my own food  even before overpayment recovery has started. I’m hoping to access a food bank next week but the period I can use them for will be limited.    It’s hard to put a figure on how much help I should ask for  since the only real solution is me finding a job where they’re not actively trying to dismiss me for my chronic health problems  but I am hopeful that if I can just get straight with the money I already owe and raise a couple of months’ living expenses to buy myself time whilst finding a better job  then I can make things work.    Thank you for reading this far; I am extremely grateful to anyone who can donate or share this page. I don’t have many followers and would really appreciate people making this fundraiser more visible. ",False

We are continuing to support these families in term time and the holidays.     £50 raised will be able to feed 25 young people    £100 raised will be able to feed 50 young people    £1000 raised will be able to feed 500 young people     There is power in our community. Join us.        Food provision through schools and youth clubs play an essential role in providing food for children and families who are in need of it - this is especially true during the holidays  when Free School Meals (FSM) are not usually available. Recently  the government (after several U-turns) decided to extend funding for FSM over the school holidays  but several families received substandard food packages that still forced them to rely on extra aid from food banks and mutual aid community groups.    Many young people are also not entitled to free school meals during term time because their parents earn above the amount allowed for eligibility for free school meals. In England  earnings from employment must be less than £16 190 for families in receipt of Child Tax or Working Tax Credits  and only £7 400 per year for families in receipt of Universal Credit.     This is staggeringly low and  when combined with measures such as the two child limit on Universal Credit payments  means that many families struggling to put food on the table are nevertheless deemed ineligible for free school meals. Other families are unable to claim FSM for their children because they have no recourse to public funds (NPRF) which is a condition the government imposes on some families due to their immigration status.      What does this mean?    Those recently impacted by the financial costs of COVID-19 (which are only increasing)  are more likely to go hungry. This will have bothphysiological and psychological impacts on young people and their families.     Why?    The data collected by CPAG on child poverty in the UK are enraging: 4.2 million children were living in poverty in the UK in 2018-19  out of which 700 000 were in London. This has been worsened by the fact that parents and carers are twice as likely to lose their jobs due to the pandemic.     In Lewisham  according to Trust for London   37% of children are in a situation of food insecurity  and 14% of the population needs social benefits to survive. It's deeply distressing that this level of inequality exists in the UK  particularly given that we are one of the richest countries in the world.     Don’t know what living with food insecurity feels like? See here .    The figures above reflect the shocking inequality in Britain  which was already severely impacting children and young people before the worst financial effects caused by the pandemic began to be felt. Due to the government’s lackluster response to the pandemic  it is projected that the number of children in poverty will increase to 5.2 million by 2022.     We also cannot ignore that this impact has not been distributed equally: people coming from Communities of Colour and immigrant background are over twice as likely to live in hardship than their white British counterparts and  due to the wider structural racial injustices  these communities are also disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. We are certainly not 'all in this together'.      What are we doing about it?     Legendary Community Club  which was named by Chevrington Odoh from the Pro Plus FC   is a grassroots project set up by some members of Lewisham Mutual Aid in partnership with local organisations. Our aim is to deliver emergency food provision to ensure that young people do not go without out  for as long as there is a need.       We will make this happen in three ways:    1. Temporary food provisions have been set-up for families who require this support  in partnership with local schools and community groups.    2. A kitchen has been set up to prepare nutritionally balanced meals for young people through their youth clubs which run after school and in the school holidays.    We know that food charity is not a long term solution. This is not the world we want to live in and we refuse to normalise food banks as a solution to food poverty. This is NOT an inevitable situation.    3. With this in mind  we will continue to work alongside The Children's Society  who have been calling on the government to ensure that every local council adequately funds emergency support for families   so that nobody is left behind in a time of crisis. For more information about their campaign 'Strengthening the Safety Net' see here   and sign the petition here.    We will also continue to support the calls from Save the Children and Child Poverty Action Group who have been lobbying for reforms to the benefits system  as well as an increase in the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit by £20  and an end to the two child limit and the £20 000 a year benefit cap which hits families in high-rent areas such as Lewisham particularly hard. Lastly  we will continue to support IFAN with the #CashFirst campaign  which has already inspired us to start our very own community-led participatory research project (stay tuned for more on this!).     The way our tax and welfare system is designed is a political choice. There are solutions . We will call on the government and its representatives to be bold  brave and radical in how they approach this problem.       What will we use the funds for?      We will use the money raised from the community to buy food and equipment for the project.    We have a host of volunteers  and multiple clubs and schools signed up and ready to go.

Job security is becoming less stable as the furlough scheme tapers out  gig economy workers can find less work and self employed people are also facing uncertainty  there is still a further need to do more and support people at this time.     We stand together and bridge the gap with this amazing and unified part of Bristol.        Thank you.    To find out more information or get in touch please have a look at our website: https://www.bristolcommunityfoodshare.com/      Donations of NON PERISHABLE food items and bathroom/kitchen essentials can be dropped off at St Werburghs community centre from 10-12 Wednesdays and 11.30-1pm Thursdays. Thank you so much         Article about the Community Food Share Scheme: https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/montpelier-school-turns-food-bank-4054385",False

The masks are distributed ‘free of charge’ to residents  community agencies  key services  care homes  food banks  the medical profession and those most in need across the city Volunteers sew the face masks and help us source material  though donations by residents  which are recycled into masks. Recycling material allows us to help the environment and deliver mask free of charge. Since launching on 8th April 2020 we have made and distributed over 1 000 masks but the demand is increasing especially as more people are going out as we come out of lockout. Volunteers have covered any additional costs to run the project to the stage but now need to raise funds to continue and deliver the increasing demand for masks. ALL the money will be used to: - purchase essential items which are not available through donations. - make and distribute the masks  free of charge to those that request them across the city (Glasgow). - help set up sewing hubs in other cities to provide the same service to residents in that area. Have a look at our Facebook page (Angelic Threads 2020) to see what we have done and how much this project is needed.",False

We are so excited about the prospect of bringing this old Grade II listed building back to life! It was originally built in the early 1900’s as a Temperance Hall  since then it has had a plethora of uses  most recent of which left the building in a semi-derelict condition which included severe fire damage.    However  following its acquisition by The Tab Church  fresh ideas began to surface as to how it might be rescued  restored  and adapted to suit the needs for modern usage as Church  Community and Conferencing facility.    The ‘Tab1Milli’ is what will enable this most significant part of the Big Build project vision to become a reality  and the building actually able to be used.    But we can’t pull this off without your generous support because this is the largest financial project The Tab has ever undertaken.    We are therefore asking you to join with us through radical generosity  as together we step out in faith towards hitting the £1Million target by continually bringing our financial gifts together now and over the coming weeks and months.    Once the entire building is renovated  it will enable The Tab to continue and expand its traditional church functions and community initiatives  which are not limited to but currently include:  · Sunday services  · Kids church for children  · Crèche during the Sunday services  · Weekly prayer meetings  · Christian education and classes  · Administrative offices  · Bookshop/resources  · Food Bank – hosting Lewisham Central’s foodbank and distribution point. This is currently offered two-three times a week  staffed by 8-12 volunteers.  · Youth mentoring – support for vulnerable young people in the local community.  · Community action team (Restoration Empowerment and Community Help) – which focuses its support and resources on three vulnerable groups in Lewisham:  The elderly (offering days out and grocery food supplies);  The homeless (offering food clothing to those living on the streets)  and  Women and children escaping from domestic abuse (offering support).    *The Big Build Project includes the overall vision of Tabernacle Global Ministries and therefore maybe used for general purposes....",False

Many families have been left to fend for themselves during this time with little support from schools and other social services. “Bridge the gap have a passion to support families  parents  children and those with additional needs as this is something dear to our hearts. At Bridge the Gap  we believe in social inclusion and want to combat the digital divide that has left so many people with no access to information  resources and learning.” - Melissa Francis had started to provide support to local families in the beginning by: Signposting them to services for further support for Befriending also offering virtual tutoring for children. Enabling access to food banks  food hubs and hot meals  Providing information on available support schemes and youth services for children’s basic educational needs (such as http://www.hackneyquest.org.uk/ and http://www.shortbreakshackney.com/short-breaks-offer-update-covid-19)  Supporting SEN families with information through https://www.hiphackney.org.uk/home.html Sourcing laptops and other devices for families that are not eligible for other kinds of funding  Sharing of information to families regarding benefit claims so that people are not pushed into homelessness. At the beginning of the pandemic  we worked with T’s tasty cuisine to provide 1 hot meal  food parcels and essential items every Wednesday for a short period. We continue to work alongside Hackney quest  the wickers charity  Caribeats and Connecting all communities organisation to provide care packages or a hot meal to families. Our main focus going forward is to provide laptops and other devices to families who otherwise would not be able to access them. These months of enforced homeschooling and unpredicted lockdown period have revealed the many barriers facing low-income families (incl. job losses  food insecurity  housing issues  domestic abuse  family bereavements and many more…). The closure of libraries and community cafes that were previously used for learning  job applications and other resources has further worsened this divide  with many people struggling to access information on where to get help. Many families have been left with no access to a laptop to continue their children’s learning and larger families have struggled to share one computer between parents working from home and multiple children needing access to online learning. since schools began to reopen after the first lockdown  we had still seen numerous amount of families still struggling for devices for their children till current  and even at present through this uncertain wave of numerous lockdowns  the list of referrals are rising as families desperately require a device for their children  hence our determination to continue with this project to help families. We have teamed up with tutors around different boroughs to provide online learning for children with the aim for children to be supported with learning they have missed out on. We aim to continue to support families to help make a difference to their lives.     Your generous donation can help make a difference.      £1000 can help support 10 families and their children or 7 families.     The break down per refurbished device is £85 per unit £15 for windows 10 to be installed per device equal to £100 per device and software.    For 10 families this will be £1000 required to raise to offer support.    For a new device purchased from curry's under a business rate of £150 we will only be able to support 7 families with a device.     1 X Amazon Tablet for a family in need (£50.00) Fuel costs to cover the expenses of our generous Community Helpers so they are not out of pocket. We think this is a really effective way to support families in Hackney and in other borough's that has reached out to our service  as we are offering a long-term solution to an urgent need. So far we have been able to offer 136 plus digital devices to families  and have 47 families are on the waiting list with more requests coming in. We wouldn’t be able to do what we do without your generous support  So Thank You!

A pipe-walking roadmap  With the Scottish Government relaxation of lockdown guidelines on 28 May I began gradually reducing the frequency and extent of my pipe-walking  concentrating on the main or bigger streets. I had a quiet autumn and even quieter winter  but as of early April 2021 I am getting active again. I plan to continue as last year  but much less intensively. Please keep requests coming for any special events and occasions you may have. For children and the elderly  ill or vulnerable  the level of modest donations I suggest is significantly lower than for others.    And if you know your history....   On 28.3.20  I picked up my oft idle bagpipes and started wandering rather cluelessly round Broxburn and Uphall playing them. I had realised that as a semi-retired person I was pretty much 'alright Jack' under lockdown and wondered if I could do anything to help others. My first idea  on 20 May  had been to go to NHS Strathbrock and play for the amusement of staff and patients. That day I also put my busking hat down with a sign saying ""all proceeds to...."" After securing permission from the police  I decided to put the hat back on my head and start my ""pipe-walks"" around Kirkhill and West End  intending to return to the Strathbrock  of course  and at least three facilities for older residents near me. Soon I was getting more than one request on average per day  from all over B&U and beyond....     Thank you  t.... y..  t.... y..  +1 ⚓☀️   I have been so astonished and moved by the huge warm response everywhere I've walked and played in the months since. Many people were soon wanting to give me money in return for my effort to cheer them up and relieve boredom  and when I refused all payment some suggested I should start some kind of fundraiser. Enter Kelly - thank you. I'm already adding to and improving my musical equipment and piper's costume. If it is welcomed by you  B&U  this new GoFundMe will continue that  compensate me for lost busking earnings during lockdown  while giving 20% to charity.",False

About 200 per fortnight. I cook the meals with love and care and it is a privilege to be able to do so.     I began by wanting to help NHS and Care Home staff during the first Covid 19 lockdown in March 2020. So far I have cooked 0ver 6000 meals that I have made as delicious  pretty and nutritional as possible. I have also made sure they can be safely frozen and defrosted and can be re-heated in a microwave.     After 2 periods of self-isolation I started cooking from home on the 24th of April 2020 for the staff at my local care home  an NHS critical care nurse and a weeks worth of meals for an 89 year old I've been cooking for since he lost his wife years ago.     I have moved from 52 meals to a maximum of 206 on January 11 2021 and I am averaging about 100 per week at the moment (June 2021 ) I keep some meals in my freezer so that if anyone has a tough shift  they can contact me and I can give them a home-cooked meal to go home with. I spend 14 hours or so every Wednesday cooking for carers and will continue to do so for as long as I can; hopefully the rest of my life. The NHS has looked after me and my kids brilliantly and I want to give back.     I am utterly inspired by the NHS  Community Centre and Care Home Staff I meet. They make me want to be kinder  work harder and just be better.     My ultimate goal is to do this by teaching kids how to do the cooking with so that there is a double and ever growing benefit. But for now  I want to feed people and make their lives a little bit easier. I want them to be able to rely on a meal from me every Wednesday or Thursday.    Giving one person a wonderful meal means something. Donating is the same. I can make a little go a long way because I am brilliantly supported by Leathams for many ingredients  Nodene from Shands Cakes for Cakes  Ken Watts for eggs that go to Nodene to make the cakes  Val  Ian and Sue for the containers and 2000 portions so far of Swiss Chard from my Garden. 100% of the donations I receive will go towards buying ingredients  serving vessels  I have also bought protective gloves and a £50 freezer to be able to store more ingredients and meals.

Our plan is to have a refill shop run by the community and by people who have special education needs.       The refill shop will be run as a community interest company to keep the food prices competitive with local supermarkets  which would mean everyone can afford to shop plastic free helping the environment.        All money that is not put back into the buisness will go to local and environment causes.       We will also have a recycling center in our courtyard for everything that cannot go in the local grey bins.       Working with local organisations and supporting the Rutland Food Bank by taking donations at the shop and donating things that are coming to the end of their sell by dates.   We really need your help and support to set this up and are asking for donations to help start our new and exciting community project. Any donation big or small will be very much appreciated.   Also if companies would like to donate we will put a small thank you sticker with their logo onto what we bought with their money (this will most lightly be a food storage box or storage tube).   If you think you could help in any other way please contact us. We need people to help set up the shop i.e. - help with fitting  painting  decorating etc. Also help with running the shop like book keeping  restocking  ordering  working on the shop floor.   Thank you for reading and if you can help us it would be so appreciated      Jenni and Rutland Refill team ",False

Beginning in March 2020  we have delivered 600 meals a week  every week  free of charge to the most in need in South Birmingham. Through great effort  including invaluable help from many volunteers  we have racked up an impressive thirty thousand meals delivered since the first Lockdown one year ago.     We currently operate out of a single kitchen at the Jericho Building in Balsall Heath  and primarily service the wards of Hall Green  Moseley  Kings Heath  Ladywood  Basall Heath  Hockley  Sparkbrook  & Sparkhill. In these areas  we serve a great number of low-income families from diverse ethnic backgrounds  elderly residents  and vulnerable communities  some of whom belong to the homeless community.    We are about to run out of generous funding that we have so far relied on to do this important work  just at a time when we are seeing an increase in need for our services due to the economic impacts of the pandemic. We have seen that across the city  the need for food banks has doubled.    If we are to carry on this much-needed work  then we need your help in the form of any donations you can spare to help the staff and volunteers of ChangeKitchen achieve our goals over the next six months.        Our Running Cost:  So far we have maintained our level of service through grants from the Social Enterprise Support Fund (SESF) [via The National Lottery Community Fund]  and through working hand-in-hand with other charities and social enterprises within movements such as #BrumTogether  initially with the support of Birmingham City Council.     Unfortunately  this grant support is coming to an end in March  and the next round of funding is not available until July. It is therefore imperative that we find the extra donations to carry on this vital work and upgrade our infrastructure to meet the demands of the coming financial year.    It currently costs us about £4000 a month to run our social enterprise. This money goes towards wages  rent  insurance  van hire  and food to top-up the surplus  amongst other expenses.    We estimate the total cost will rise to £5000 in the coming months  in line with meeting increased future demand.    Also  our kitchen is in need of repair and refitting  since 2 out of 3 of our ovens have failed  and we are in the process of procuring a dishwasher given our increasing output.    Where we get our food donations from:  •Waitrose via FareShare Go  •Incredible Surplus (formerly TRJFP Brum) Winson Green Sharehouse  •Our partners in the #BrumTogether network   •Other food via FareShare  more recently via Coop NISA / Ruprai in Kings Heath          What We Need:    We need financial support to do the following over the next six months:    Provide a further 400 meals per week  bringing us up to 1000 meals a week.    Replace our 2 failed ovens with 1 modern  professional fan oven  so that we can increase our food output.    Upgrade our kitchen backend with some new pots  pans  and utensils to keep up with our increased workload.    What we need from you / other opportunities to help:  Although this is a fundraiser  there are other ways in which you can help us. From donating your time volunteering  to sharing our appeal for help via social media and word of mouth.    Monetary donations:    We are hoping with donations from the general public and private enterprise to raise enough to cover our general running costs and upgrade our kitchen. Any help you can give will be greatly appreciated by ourselves and the greater community we serve.    The Social Supper Club:    The Social Supper Club is ChangeKitchen’s latest offering  creating innovative mealboxes to pick up and heat & enjoy at home. This helps us (and you!) to do even more good because for every £20 spent  ChangeKitchen CIC will provide £5 of nutritious homemade meals back into the local community.    Volunteering:    We are always looking for interested volunteers to help towards the work of prepping  cooking  and cleaning at our busy Jericho Kitchen in Balsall Heath. Please get in touch at [email redacted] for more information.     Social media    Please share this page amongst your friends and any local Facebook groups to help our fundraiser get seen by as many people as possible. ",False

We fund locally owned cafes and restaurants to provide families most in need with a good meal. By doing this we are not only providing urgent support to desperate families but also supporting businesses most affected by the COVID pandemic.     Due to COVID people are losing their jobs  businesses are closing and there has been a significant increase in food poverty in the UK. Families are sacrificing food to pay their bills. The Trussell Trust have predicted that there will be a 61% increase in food bank use alone this winter and this doesn't even consider the social impact of poverty on children and families.     Every penny raised will go directly to feeding families with meals provided by local businesses. We have no overheads during the trial phase so everything you donate will go directly to providing food to families and children in real need of a meal. The trial phase will begin as soon as we can feed one family and we hope  with your support  to feed 100!     For just £5 you can feed a child a two course meal in a warm  welcoming environment. For another £5 you can feed their brother or sister a further £7  their parent(s) too. Please help us to provide these children and their families with food and human connection during these trying times.     Your donation will help us add to the growing network of food aid in the UK  help us do what the government can't and work towards ending hunger poverty!     Thank you for your support  we will keep you updated.     The Hungry Minds Team",False
