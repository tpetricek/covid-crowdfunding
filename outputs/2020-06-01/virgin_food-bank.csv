We are an ambitious highly focused charity, investing millions of pounds in research right now to find treatments and a cure and to help this generation.
The charity has been formed by the coming together of Joining Jack and Duchenne Children's Trust, the two biggest funders of research in the UK in the last three years. 
We are committed to continuing to drive momentum to deliver treatments to help this generation of those with DMD.
Please visit our website at www.duchenneuk.org.
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a desperately cruel muscle wasting disease that mainly affects boys. It’s the most common fatal genetic disease to affect children. It is 100% fatal and boys die in their early 20s. There are no treatments and no cure. But thanks to recent breakthroughs and with your help, we can save them.
There are lots of ways up can help us. Make a donation on this page, create your own event, or visit the campaigns and events sections to find out about our latest events - and then please join us.

[b] (Children’s Health and Nutrition Care and Education) [/b]
is a registered charity founded by Barbara Datson in 2007 with the explicit aim of helping children in Nepal who are sick, orphaned, handicapped, or underprivileged.
Working closely with established and trusted organisations, schools and hospitals on the ground in Nepal, CHANCE for NEPAL gives aid and support for children and their families as well as educational and training opportunities. 
We sponsor and support projects in Nepal relating to:
HEALTH-EDUCATION-STREET-CHILDREN-VOCATIONAL TRAINING - RABIES PREVENTION
Our medical support in Nepal focuses on the burns units of two hospitals, the Kanti Children's Hospital and the Trauma Hospital both in Kathmandu. We fund weekly nutritional food baskets for each patient coming to the burns unit, as well physiotherapy and counselling 5 times per week. Every child coming on to the Burns Unit receives a 'Goody Bags' containing fun things to do to keep them amused.  We fund up to 40 skin graft operatons a year in these two hospitals. Our support at the Kanti started in 2004.

We support Mountain Heart Nepal  who deploy medical teams in times of crisis - earthquake/flood, by funding medicines for the health camp as well as funding a 'Magic Read' programme where children receive a text book covering health related information targeted at their age. 
We support Papa's Children's Home for 25 children who either have no parents or a parent who can no longer take care of their child. Our support is to fund all the food costs for this home as well as a monthly activitity prrogramme. Our support at Papa's Children's Home started in 2012.

We fund a milk programme and a 'Tiffin"" meal in three schools. Our support in schools started in 2006.
We support WCS (Women's Cooperative Society) with skills training. Over 160 women receive elementary and advanced training in how to grow seasonal vegetables. We fund 5 trainings per year. This empowers women to earn a good income by taking out a small loan with WCS, attending the 4 day training, then growing and selling their vegetables at market, thus enabling them to educate one or more of their children. Our support with WCS started in 2005.

We fund up to 1000 rabies vaccinations through Sneha's Care in Kathmandu and fund leaflets and posters to be used in schools and villages to educate children and adults about the dangers of rabies. Our support fighting rabies started in 2005.
CHANCE for Nepal has set up an educational sponsorship programme at three schools in Kathmandu where 37 students are being sponsored for their education, in schools, colleges and University by English sponsors. 
We have funded the building of 5 schools and 2 health posts in remote areas in Western Nepal.
All our projects are regularly monitored by Westerners living and working in Nepal.

For every £1 donated, the Felix Project saves £4 of food. Our operation is simple, reliable and efficient. We have a small team of staff and over 400 volunteers who drive, walk and cycle to collect food from suppliers and deliver it to around 200 charities and schools.

We are fairly unique in our approach: the dignity of each client is foremost, they choose the food they need, and we don't require clients to be referred or have vouchers, prefering to trust each client. 

We provide a warm welcome, tea and a sandwich/cake while clients wait to do their 'shopping'. Free legal advice is available at each foodbank session.

EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by one full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.  
EFP operates 7 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme.
Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances.
Each food pack provides at least three meals for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave).
In 2018-19, we provided 11,495 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 19.6% increase on the previous year.
We were able to do so by receiving 130,000kg of food from public donations.
Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps.
Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres.

In the UK, more than 14 million people are living in poverty – including 4.5 million children. We support more than 1,200 food bank centres in the UK to provide a minimum of three days’ nutritionally-balanced emergency food to people who have been referred in crisis, as well as support to help people resolve the crises they face. Between April 2018 and March 2019, food banks in our network provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis, a 19% increase on the previous year.
That's why your fundraising is important now more than ever. Over the last 5 years food bank use in our network has increased by 73%. This is a trend we need to break and we can only do this with your support. We value every penny raised and every conversation started. 
We know it takes more than food to end hunger. That’s why we bring together the experiences of food banks in our network to challenge the structural economic issues that lock people in poverty, and campaign to end the need for food banks in the UK.

is a registered charity founded by Barbara Datson in 2007 with the explicit aim of helping children in Nepal who are sick, orphaned, handicapped, or underprivileged.
Working closely with established and trusted organisations, schools and hospitals on the ground in Nepal, CHANCE for NEPAL gives aid and support for children and their families as well as educational and training opportunities. 
We sponsor and support projects in Nepal relating to:
HEALTH-EDUCATION-STREET-CHILDREN-VOCATIONAL TRAINING - RABIES PREVENTION
Our medical support in Nepal focuses on the burns units of two hospitals, the Kanti Children's Hospital and the Trauma Hospital both in Kathmandu. We fund weekly nutritional food baskets for each patient coming to the burns unit, as well physiotherapy and counselling 5 times per week. Every child coming on to the Burns Unit receives a 'Goody Bags' containing fun things to do to keep them amused.  We fund up to 40 skin graft operatons a year in these two hospitals. Our support at the Kanti started in 2004.

We support Mountain Heart Nepal  who deploy medical teams in times of crisis - earthquake/flood, by funding medicines for the health camp as well as funding a 'Magic Read' programme where children receive a text book covering health related information targeted at their age. 
We support Papa's Children's Home for 25 children who either have no parents or a parent who can no longer take care of their child. Our support is to fund all the food costs for this home as well as a monthly activitity prrogramme. Our support at Papa's Children's Home started in 2012.

We fund a milk programme and a 'Tiffin"" meal in three schools. Our support in schools started in 2006.
We support WCS (Women's Cooperative Society) with skills training. Over 160 women receive elementary and advanced training in how to grow seasonal vegetables. We fund 5 trainings per year. This empowers women to earn a good income by taking out a small loan with WCS, attending the 4 day training, then growing and selling their vegetables at market, thus enabling them to educate one or more of their children. Our support with WCS started in 2005.

We fund up to 1000 rabies vaccinations through Sneha's Care in Kathmandu and fund leaflets and posters to be used in schools and villages to educate children and adults about the dangers of rabies. Our support fighting rabies started in 2005.
CHANCE for Nepal has set up an educational sponsorship programme at three schools in Kathmandu where 37 students are being sponsored for their education, in schools, colleges and University by English sponsors. 
We have funded the building of 5 schools and 2 health posts in remote areas in Western Nepal.
All our projects are regularly monitored by Westerners living and working in Nepal.

We are an ambitious highly focused charity, investing millions of pounds in research right now to find treatments and a cure and to help this generation.

It is 100% fatal and boys die in their early 20s. There are no treatments and no cure. But thanks to recent breakthroughs and with your help, we can save them.

We’re determined to reach every young person with cancer in the UK – and to make sure they’re supported by experts in young people’s cancer from the moment they're diagnosed.

Coronavirus is having a massive impact on all aspects of our lives - and as a charity, Project Trust is no exception. 
Our first response and priority was to urgently repatriate our 2019/20 Volunteers. This was a major challenge undertaken in unprecedented circumstances, achieved through hard work, collaboration and decisive action.
Now, our priority is to secure Project Trust's future.
The costs of repatriation and some of the extraordinary lengths to which we went to secure the safe return of our young people, combined with uncertainty due to the impact of the Coronavirus, is significantly impacting on our work. 
Project Trust’s future is threatened and we need your help. We are appealing to the whole Project Trust Family for all the support and donations you can give.
Your Best Year 
Project Trust is in it's 53rd year, which in itself is impressive. But our real successes lie in the impact on the overseas Communities in which our Volunteers live and work, the personal development of Volunteers, and the many ways in which Returned Volunteers have then applied their experiences to everyday life.
Society has never needed globally-aware young people with an empathy and understanding for cultures and peoples more than it does right now. Safeguarding Project Trust’s future together will allow future generations of young people to experience unique overseas opportunities we have offered across 67 countries since 1967.
That is why doing Project Trust is an adventure like no other. And that is why we know how much you care about Project Trust and how much you, whether as a Volunteer, Parent or Friend value the experiences on offer. 

With that in mind, please give generously.
Thank you
The Project Trust Team

We work to alleviate the distress caused by homelessness and bad housing by giving advice, information and advocacy to people in housing need, and by campaigning for lasting political change to end the housing crisis for good.

Shelter will help anyone with a housing problem, whether they are a home-owner struggling to pay their mortgage, a tenant in conflict with their landlord or a homeless person looking for a roof over their head. Our housing experts give advice and support by phone or email, or face-to-face at our network of housing aid centres and in county courts and outreach centres.   We also have specialist projects that provide long term support to people who are trying to escape bad housing and homelessness.

Shelter tackles the root causes of bad housing by lobbying government and local authorities for new laws and policies, and more investment, to improve the lives of homeless and badly housed people.  Our influential campaigns bring aspects of bad housing to the attention of the media and the public, who  help us fight for solutions.

EFP Board of Trustees govern the charity while the work of the charity is overseen by one full-time and three part-time employees, and over 200 dedicated volunteers.  
EFP operates 7 foodbanks in areas of multiple deprivation across Edinburgh, providing emergency food supplies to people in need. Established in 2012, the charity now also works to break the cycle of food poverty through its More Than Food programme.
Each person we help has been referred to us by one of our 230 support agency partners who are looking after the longer-term problems a person may have. People can be referred to us for three food packs in a six-month period.  This is to ensure clients do not become dependent on the foodbank long term.  However, we can provide long term support if there are special circumstances.
Each food pack provides at least three meals for three days, and some snacks. We are also able to offer additional services such as toiletries, household items, pet food, specialist dietary items and kettle packs (for those who do not have access to a cooker/microwave).
In 2018-19, we provided 11,495 parcels to men, women and children. This was a 19.6% increase on the previous year.
We were able to do so by receiving 130,000kg of food from public donations.
Since 2017, we have expanded our focus by developing our foodbank centres in to More Than Food hubs. We conducted community-based research funded by Aspiring Communities Fund to identify the support needs of people, map existing support, and identify key gaps.
Findings from the research have shaped the development and implementation of this programme, which seeks to address the underlying causes of and help break the cycle of food poverty through the provision of appropriate advice and signposting support by partner agencies within our centres. 
Our goal is reduce the number of people who need the foodbank’s support, and ultimately to help reduce food poverty.

FORCE Cancer Charity is based in Exeter. FORCE (Friends of the Oncology and Radiotherapy Centre, Exeter) believes that anyone affected by cancer deserves the best possible treatment and professional support, close to home and face-to-face.
Since 1987 the charity has been funding local research and buying equipment to improve patient care at the Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital.
In 2004 FORCE opened a Cancer Support and Information Centre in the grounds of the RD&E. The Centre is open every weekday 9:30-4:30 (Wednesdays 6:30), except Bank Holidays, for people needing physical, emotional, psychological and practical support at a difficult time in their lives. The Centre receives around 25,000 visits a year with patients, their families, carers and friends all able to access support. It has a well-stocked library and information nurses are always on hand to help with questions and offer advice. There are counselling services for individuals and within support groups, including for children and young people, plus complementary therapies, exercise guidance, relaxation and mindfulness sessions, a benefits advice service, help to cope with hair loss and a wig fitting service.
FORCE also offers support and information sessions once a week in Okehampton, Tiverton and Honiton. The charity also funds the delivery of chemotherapy in all three towns.

All of FORCE’s services are free of charge.
Since the charity was founded it has spent well over £8million on support, equipment and research. FORCE receives no Government or NHS funding. FORCE needs to raise £1.7million every year to maintain the services it offers. That money comes entirely from voluntary contributions - legacies, donations, the FORCE charity shop and from fundraising events. Fantastic support from the community it serves enables FORCE to fulfil its mission to support anyone locally affected by cancer.

We are fairly unique in our approach: the dignity of each client is foremost, they choose the food they need, and we don't require clients to be referred or have vouchers, prefering to trust each client. 

We provide a warm welcome, tea and a sandwich/cake while clients wait to do their 'shopping'. Free legal advice is available at each foodbank session.

""I give as much as I can to JDRF as I feel that their research is powerful and potentially life-changing. I was inspired by the Celebrity Kilimanjaro climb, and I put myself through an intense training programme to attain the physical fitness and mental determination required to get me to the top! My sweet and courageous daughter Jenny was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the tender age of 10. My daughter is lucky - she has a supportive family and excellent medical care, but...this is not enough! I want to help find the cure that will transform the lives of many people around the world."" Sally Anderton - Climb Kilimanjaro
""My daughter, now aged 10, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in April 2008.  I wanted to do something that would help with the valuable work that you are doing for children with type 1 diabetes and to show my appreciation for the advances in diabetes care from which Rachel is benefiting. I decided to do some fundraising by collecting sponsorship for completing the ‘Go Ape’ tree top course at Leeds castle.  This was a challenge as the height was well out of my comfort zone but the generous sponsorship and encouragement from friends, family and acquaintances ensured that I made it round. I am delighted to enclose a total of £550.  Our family is very grateful for the work that you do and Rachel loves her JDRF bear.  With best wishes for continued breakthroughs in type 1 diabetes treatments and hopefully a cure in the future."" Brenda Ladley - Goes Ape for JDRF","17-18 Angel Gate,  London,  EC1V 2PT",19/02/2020,06/03/2020

We believe that the most effective way of lifting a community out of poverty is to address their basic needs in an integrated way and with active local involvement. That is why we focus on four key areas: education, clean water, health and economic development. This is not a common model but one that is regarded highly by the local government officials and community leaders whom we meet during our visits.
When we started in 2006 there were some 60 students at our school in Musoto (a slum village in Bukasakya sub-county). Today we are educating close to 1,000 students. We’ve had 100% pass rate in the primary leaving examinations for the last 3 years and it is now the best performing school in the sub-county. 
In 2006, water-coverage in the area was 25%. Today it is 80%  because we have drilled 24 new boreholes and water springs to provide clean water. 
In the absence of organised healthcare we’ve funded a government based ‘Village Health Team’ (VHT) programme and have trained more than 250 men and women to give practical health advice to their villages on everything from hand washing to malaria control and HIV/Aids. They are one of the most active VHT in the Mbale District. A tangible outcome of these two initiatives is that there have been no deaths from cholera in the sub-county over the last few years. Our efforts on health and sanitation in the area were recognised (along with the likes of World Vision and Malaria Consortium) in a UN sponsored report on VHTs in Uganda.
We've set up economic development schemes to give communities a means of generating income. We've established a fish farm that generates money and provides a source of food, donated 50 goats to widows and orphans that have provided milk, fertiliser and produce to sell at the local market. We've collaborated with Rothamsted Research to increase agricultural yields and set up village savings schemes which also provide micro loans at affordable rates.
 Our impact over the last 10 years has been astonishing. But the need is still great and we know we can continue to make a lasting diference with more funding. ","102 Station Road,  Harpenden,Hertfordshire  AL5 4TU",26/11/2019,14/04/2020
