to increasing demand. We are facing an unprecedented challenge and so any donation will be warmly welcomed as we continue to support people most in need.    I am Rev Carol Bostridge  Senior Project Manager of Lewisham Foodbank  I live in Sydenham and have been employed part-time by the Foodbank for 5 years.     All donations given via this campaign will be used by Lewisham Foodbank to either purchase food for our clients or enhancing the service we offer (eg providing volunteers with gloves  setting up a delivery service for those self isolating and purchasing addition equipment as needed).     All donations will be given directly to Lewisham Foodbank which is part of a registered charity (Transform Network) and their trustees will oversee the spending of the money and produce clear accounts.",False

SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING. PEOPLE ARE LOSING WORK.     1.3 MILLION FOOD BANK PARCELS WERE HANDED OUT BY THE TRUSSELL TRUST IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAST YEAR  to people who would have gone hungry if not for charitable help.    I've been a food bank user myself. I'm only here today because of the kindness of strangers - donating food  distributing it  identifying that I was struggling and helping me out.     And now the supermarket shelves are empty. People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.    As the impact of coronavirus takes hold  and the knock on effect of unpaid work  unfulfilled contracts  zero hours workers getting literally zero hours  new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay  who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!)  More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank  only to find that their shelves are empty too.    It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.    People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.    We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy  society  communities. But poverty is already isolating  lonely  and exhausting. If we all turn inwards and only look after ourselves  more and more people are going to slip through the cracks.    All the money raised here does directly to the TRUSSELL Trust who will use it to support people in need and at risk of food insecurity and hunger throughout the UK.    If you can't afford to donate - sharing it on social media is free. Thankyou for your support.    The Trussell Trust  in conjunction with local communities  develops and runs sustainable projects in the UK tackling poverty and exclusion. Through the UK Foodbank Network and Community Enterprises we work with marginalised people in real need  providing practical care and support. www.trusselltrust.org.    All the best    Jack Monroe.

struggling since the Coronavirus outbreak. Last week alone  they helped 285 families and they expect this to increase in the coming weeks. Some of our players and friends of the club  will run a combined total of 200km in one day (this Saturday 2nd of May)  and each individual will contribute with either a 5km or 10km  also ensuring the governments social distancing guidelines are adhered to. (Runners will go out on their own) We would encourage family members  pals  work colleagues to join in and/or donate. We’re aiming to do something positive for the community by helping those who are less fortunate in difficult times. If you can spare a few quid then it would go a long way! Thank you.",True

desperate poverty. I was eventually referred to a food bank  where I survived for six months on kindness and donated tins and packets. I started to write about my experiences online  and haven't stopped since. I now write cookery books teaching people to cook on the smallest of budgets and smallest of kitchens. I work with food banks  charities  homelessness shelters  and campaign against austerity and for decent jobs and wages.     Tin Can Cook is my fourth cookbook  and I insisted on writing it  partly as an entry-level cookbook for people who have never learned to cook  but mostly to restore some dignity to a food bank box. To give people choices  and agency  and good food  and resources. Tin Can Cook is a book of 75 easy  fun  delicious recipes  made from tin cans! Recipes include Carrot Cake Overnight Oats from a tin of carrots  Tinned Spud Fishcakes  a Chicken And Ham Pie  lots of curries  Cherry Chocolate Fudge  and how to cook pasta from a kettle or microwave. Tin Can Cook has received a lot of encouragement since it was first announced  with Jay Rayner from the Guardian describing it as 'both a brilliant thing and necessary'  and support from Tom Parker Bowles  Ryan Riley from LifeKitchen  Nigella Lawson  and an article in the Telegraph.    I have donated my previous books to food banks and told them they can photocopy the pages to hand out to their clients  and they have done so in their thousands. I have made thousands of recipe cards to hand out to food bank users in conjunction with Oxfam and the Trussell Trust. But I want to do more.    I want this book to reach as many people as it needs to. I'm not in this to make money - the royalties for an author are laughably piteous  7-10% of the RRP - so this isn't about flogging books. It's about giving people hope  dignity  and decent meals in the most dire of situations. And you can help.    At the moment  the retail price for Tin Can Cook is £6.99. I also need to factor in postage  packaging  and administrative costs. (I have done a Kickstarter before and ended up personally very out of pocket for not accurately factoring in postage costs  so I am being over cautious with my calculations  as it is better to overdeliver than disappoint. If I do find a way to get around the postage costs to deliver to approximately 400 different locations  I will donate the difference directly to the Trussell Trust and let you know).    I am also in conversation with corporate sponsors to see if they would match the books donated by you  which would be fantastic!    So  with postage  admin costs  packaging  and all that nonsense  at the moment I estimate that for every £9 raised  one book and three tins will be donated to a foodbank. (If this changes for any reason  and it shouldn't  I will let you know).    Books will be evenly distributed throughout the Trussell Trust network of food banks across the whole of the UK - you can find the areas that they cover here: https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/find-a-foodbank/ (but it's pretty much all of them!)    And what do I get out of this? Well to be honest  not much at all. But that's not what I'm doing it for. I wish I was rich enough to just donate a million books for every food bank user in Britain  every family in poverty  every school  every library  but I just earn the Living Wage (yes  really) and some months even that's a bit hairy  so I can't do this by myself. But you can help.     I know £9 is a lot of money to some people  so pledges start at £5  meaning you can co-fund a book with another donor. For every £9 raised  one book and three tins will be donated to a food bank  and they will go to a family or a person who would be at risk of starving without emergency food help.    To find out more about the work of the Trussell Trust  click here: https://www.trusselltrust.org/what-we-do/    To find out more about what I do  click here: https://www.independent.co.uk/helpahungrychild/jack-monroe-worst-christmas-help-a-hungry-child-food-poverty-the-independent-christmas-appeal-the-a8085251.html    For my backstory  click here: https://cookingonabootstrap.com/2012/07/30/hunger-hurts/    Every penny raised will go towards making a real difference  so thankyou for your help.    The Trussell Trust currently operate 420 food banks across the UK. Here's a breakdown of where the money raised here will go.    If we raise £3 780  every Trussell Trust food bank in the UK can receive one copy of Tin Can Cook to photocopy and hand out the photocopies to their clients - I've waived the copyright for food banks  they can copy it to their hearts content. I did this with previous books and foodbank managers said it made a real difference. And 1260 tins of food will be donated across the UK to feed people in need.    If we raise £7 560  every Trussell Trust food bank in the UK will receive two copies of the book  and 2 520 tins of food will be donated.    If we raise £37 800  every TT food bank in the UK will receive ten copies of Tin Can Cook  to distribute to 4 200 food bank users  and 12 600 tins of food will be donated across the UK to feed people who would be at risk of going hungry otherwise.    To give a book and a parcel of tins to every food bank user in Britain  we would need to raise around £7m. So every donation counts. Every single donation counts. If you can't afford to donate  please share on your social media instead - it's free!     If you have any further questions  or for press enquiries  please get in touch on thetincancook@gmail.com and I or my admin angel  Caroline  will get back to you.    Thanks again for your support - I know this book would have made a real difference to me on the breadline  and I want to make that difference for other people.

But the coronavirus epidemic will be a massive challenge for them  on a whole new scale. More and more people are going to need their help over the next few months.    People on zero hours contracts won't get paid.    Food will need to be delivered to the elderly and sick who are self-isolating.    If schools close  many children will lose their main meal and need to be fed.    And all this is happening at a time when the rest of us are going to the supermarket less and - let's be honest - thinking about our own food cupboards first.    So  here's a very simple way to help. You give money. Every time we get to £100 I ask the foodbank what they need most and go and get it. If things get really bad  I will organise a delivery. We all keep doing this over and over again until things get better.      Why aren't Fair Frome doing this? Well  they've got a heck of a lot on their plate right now and this is one way I can take the load off them. It's also easier for me to set up a fundraiser as an individual.    Who am I anyway? Good question  I have volunteered for the food bank before  and here I am with Lenka  their co-ordinator  in the food bank. Fair Frome know that I am making this appeal and are very happy to have the fundraising happen.      I will post the receipt on here every time I go shopping.    But if you're still worried  please do take some food to the Fair Frome collection points in Sainsburys  Asda  Frome Wholefoods and Barnardos instead.       Frome is a great community. Let's channel this and do our best to see all our town through the next few months.    ",True

It’s fair to say  Covid-19 has disrupted all our lives. I see so many amazing people thriving  taking up new hobbies and undergoing fitness transformations across the country! ...I have not been one of those people!     If eating chocolate biscuits was a sport  I’d be a McVtties gold bar winner! Day in day out  I watch the news in admiration of front-line workers  feeling a little bit useless  not knowing how I could do my bit during this pandemic.     After being inspired by the likes of Captain Tom I wanted to complete a challenge in the Month of May.     So here I am..  Firstly I’m kicking off my page by donating £5 and then everyday in the Month of May I will walk  run or cycle 5k and nominate 5 people to do the same. I just ask those who participate to donate £5 to this worthy cause and help raise vital funds for these 2 worthwhile organisations.     Who?     Mencap NI continue to support children and adults with a learning disability  who are arguably some of the most vulnerable individuals & families.     Rosario Food Bank     A cross community effort  the local Rosario Football  Gaelic  Boxing &Youth Clubs all came together and created a food bank in response to need in the local area. They will source  buy and deliver much needed supplies to anyone local in the area no questions asked.    Soooo it wouldn’t be me without my shouting to the world about my challenge  so expect pics  videos and a lot of complaining on my part. Thank you and let’s get fit and do our bit to help those fabulous people who are the real hero’s! ",True

It is more important than ever that we work together to support one another. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund has launched to provide support to those most at need in our community. The Greenwich Food Bank Fund Right now many of us are understandably feeling anxious and vulnerable  but there are many among us that need immediate support in order to ensure that they can have access to food. Greenwich residents have a proud history of looking after one another - and never has this been more important than now. So I have been working with Greenwich Food Bank to create the Greenwich Food Bank Fund. As the borough faces one of its most important challenges in living memory  the Fund has been set up to ensure that those in need across the borough have access to the help they need. Please  even during this most difficult of times  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Greenwich. Please be assured that even the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference. Thank you for your generosity. FAQs Where will the funds go? The funds will go directly to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by the Greenwich Food Bank and delivered to food banks across the borough  from Blackheath to Eltham  Kidbrooke  Thamesmead and beyond. A full list of food bank locations is available at https://greenwich.foodbank.org.uk/locations/. If I donate will it go directly to those who need it? Yes  your donation will go directly to Greenwich Food Bank. Unlike some other platforms  GoFundMe does not charge a fundraising fee although it takes a small transaction fee. See https://www.gofundme.com/c/free-fundraising for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to. Will the money be spent in Greenwich? Yes. Is there anything else I can do? The most immediate need is to raise finance  so that purchasing can continue. However there is also a need to: (1) donate food where possible; and (2) create a team of delivery drivers as the Food Bank moves to a delivery model. If you are able to help with either of these  please email contact@greenwichfoodbank.co.uk. Where can I find more information about Covid-19? For general information on CV-19  please visit the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response or the NHS at https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/. If you have concerns about your own health  please call the NHS on 111.",True

On my first few doorstep photo sessions  I’ve been asking people to donate to the NHS Charities.    The COVID crisis is affecting so many people in so many ways. Because of this for the next few sessions I was going to donate to the food bank at Middlewich. It’s part of the Trussel Trust but needs it’s own support in these tough times.    All the money here goes directly to them  helping them feed those most in need. Having a child of my own it breaks my heart to think of a child going hungry during this pandemic.    Many thanks for donating and helping an amazing cause. Louise.xx",True

We value all our supporters who make a big difference. We provide three days’ emergency food and support to local families and people in crisis.     Covid19 is impacting Rhondda Foodbank in the following ways:    1. Increased demand across the Rhondda with prospects of getting worse.    2. Reduction in food donations because of the change in shopping habits.    3. Self-isolation of some of our regular volunteers.    Our goal with your support is to ensure that no-one in the Rhondda goes hungry during this crisis.     For more information about the Rhondda Foodbank visit our website here.

putting back into the community for food banks for families unable to work So lockdown is now upon us all so I thought of a way of raising money for nhs frontline staff and foodbanks for families unable to work  And a way to keep people smiling  So..... nominate a friend to shave there hair ( it’ll grow back by the time we’re out of this sh#t ) They name there price  Check the link to see if

That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks  supported by The Trussell Trust  working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.    ABOUT OUR FOODBANK  An introduction to the Morecambe Bay Foodbank project.  Morecambe Bay Foodbank is a project founded by local churches and community groups  working together towards stopping hunger in our local area. It began life at the GYM Church on Green Street in Morecambe and has now moved to The West End Community Centre on Westminster Road in Morecambe. We receive and distribute over six tonnes of food each month and our operation has been growing since its inception in 2012.     We have a small staff team led by our Foodbank Manager  Annette Smith  and over eighty regular volunteers who give up their time to help us each week.    ABOUT  HOW FOODBANKS WORK  Providing emergency food to people in crisis.  Every day people in the UK go hungry for reasons ranging from redundancy to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. A simple box of food makes a big difference  with foodbanks helping prevent crime  housing loss  family breakdown and mental health problems.    FOOD IS DONATED  Schools  churches  businesses and individuals donate non-perishable  in-date food to a foodbank. Large collections often take place as part of Harvest Festival celebrations and food is also collected at supermarkets.    FOOD IS SORTED AND STORED  Volunteers sort food to check that it’s in date and pack it into boxes ready to be given to people in need. Over 40 000 people give up their time to volunteer at foodbanks.    PROFESSIONALS IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN NEED  Foodbanks partner with a wide range of care professionals such as doctors  health visitors  social workers and police to identify people in crisis and issue them with a foodbank voucher.    CLIENTS RECEIVE FOOD  Foodbank clients bring their voucher to a foodbank centre where it can be redeemed for three days’ emergency food. Volunteers meet clients over a warm drink or free hot meal and are able to signpost people to agencies able to solve the longer-term problem.",True

Bevendean Foodbank serves Bevendean  Moulsecoome  AND Coldean. This is a huge area for a weekly Foodbank. With the current COVID-19 situation  Kate recently attended an emergency food meeting for Moulsecoomb and Bevendean. The upshot is that Bevendean Food bank may have to close Fear not  though  as The Bevendean Cooperative Pub has closed as a pub and is now the identified main hub for the area in the Council's city wide emergency food plan. They will be coordinating deliveries of both food parcels and cooked food. They urgently needed funds to buy in initial supplies  to undertake a deep clean  to retain staff and  really urgently  to buy containers for cooked meals. This is why I have donated £1000 of this GoFundMe to them to enable to them hit the ground running and keep this vital support going during these unpredictable times. This does  of course  leave the GoFundMe in its last few hundred pounds. I have seen a spike in donations since Monday which is amazing and thank you all so much for your continued support. I am asking that you share this GoFundMe around as MANY PLACES AS YOU CAN so we can continue to support as many people as possible. Donating money to the fund is more helpful  and safer  than donating food. I can buy in bulk with more money and get better deals. I work closely with the Foodbank to get a list of the items they desperately need which ensures they are stocked with the right things all the time. I am not an “at risk” person so having just me out and about collecting and dropping food is safer than having many people donating. Thank you  once again  to everyone who donated the first time around and who is donating now. I couldn’t have done any of this without you all ❤️",True

But as importantly to raise much needed funds to purchase PPE for frontline staff and food for those in need due to this unprecedented crisis. We would appeal to all organisations in the wider area to donate any PPE equipment they would have to help protect our vital frontline workers. Due to a number of donations and an online fundraiser we have been able to purchase PPE which has been passed on to frontline staff in the local area. We have also passed on a wide range of donations to the local food bank appeals taking place. We are establishing a fund in order to purchase additional PPE which frontline staff urgently need at this crucial time in the fight against Covid-19 and also to assist the vital work of all the food banks. Please donate if you can. If you can help in any way  please contact us also. Whether it be food  donations  or contacts . Please get in touch.

We want to provide care bags with toiletries & sweets for when they need a quick boost on the go. We are hearing how hot & busy it gets  so this simple gesture will make a difference and remind them that the public do care. Of course  the best thing we can all do to help them  is stay at home and fully-respect social distancing. But many of you want to do more to say thank you and every £ will help. We know money is extra-tight for some families at the moment  so please give what you can or if you can’t give  please share the GoFundMe with others. On this note  we would like to donate half the proceeds of this appeal to the Boston Foodbank (c/o reg charity 1138045 Parish of Boston)This is to help our health service with wider public health at this time  as people who can eat well are stronger and have better immune systems to fight off infection. Also feedback from some healthcare workers is that they really appreciate the public support  but feel well-paid. So they would like people to help those less well-off in our community.     Thank you and please help us not only reach our target ASAP  but also go beyond so we can provide more care packs  and also donate to other foodbanks in the Pilgrim catchment area if we smash our target!

I am running the Liverpool half marathon in March in support of South Liverpool Foodbank. Why have I chosen this particular cause? Here are some numbers...    - More than 11 000 people used SL Foodbank last year  - One in three children in Liverpool are growing up in poverty. In some areas of the city region  that rises above 50%.  - In the 2019 Indices of Deprivation  Liverpool ranked 2nd in England for highest proportion of neighbourhoods classed among the 10% most deprived nationally.    Food banks really shouldn't have to exist  but we have a government in this country which systematically perpetuates poverty and inequality  so sadly they're an absolute necessity for millions of people to live.     It might be 21km worth of pain on the day  but it will be for a very important and worthwhile cause. Anything you can give is greatly appreciated.     https://southliverpool.foodbank.org.uk/",True

5","Christmas is one of the toughest times of the year for lots of people. Whilst many families over-indulge during the festive period  others struggle to put even the most basic meal on the table to feed their family - a harrowing reality of where Britain is at in 2019.    At the heart of Football is community  and at the heart of community are good people willing to dedicate their time and money to supporting those in need. No one wants to rely on food banks or soup kitchens to feed their children  but while we may feel powerless to fight the institution that has caused his hardship  we can fight to bring a modicum of security to the most vulnerable by giving a few spare coins or an hour of our time over to a cause like this. Where people would otherwise face malnourishment  food banks are the flickering flame of a beacon in an otherwise dark night.    The people at the Sunderland Foodbank and the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen do an amazing job of ensuring that families and homeless people all over Wearside don’t go without - but unless people assist with their kind donations  none of it is possible.    Whatever you can give  it all helps.    - We have chosen this year to support the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen and the Sunderland Foodbank  with all donations going to the two organisations. Please give generously - support your local community at this difficult time.    - On Wednesday 11th of December we will proceed with distributing the funds to the two charities  who will use the money this Christmas to feed the hungry and homeless in Sunderland. Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen feed people seven days a week and will now be able to buy pallets of fresh produce to cook with  whilst the foodbank will be able to use the money to produce emergency three day food parcels.

We at CIG are very lucky people  we work for a company that cares for us and pays us and allows us to work from home.     With the care packages sent out i was thinking that there must be a lot of needy people needing support with food and care during this trying time and rather than sit there and wait for someone to help i decided to start this charity drive to earn a little of money to give to the stockport foodbank charity  they currently have 7 locations in stockport and help all people who are in need of extra  not just during this trying time but always.

This show is the culmination and celebration of years of study and creativity  and to lose it was a huge blow. Glasgow School of Art’s institutional response has been (at time of writing) sorely lacking.    A group of us affected students (and generous others) have made the DS2020 Simulator  a virtual recreation of our show that never happened  in its intended location of Glasgow’s Stow College.     We hope this can be the final celebration of our work we never really got  but in this case made by us  and accessible to everyone across barriers financial  medical  geographical and otherwise.

Not only is Canned Laughter incredibly fun but all proceeds from ticket sales go directly to the local food bank in the area the gig is put on in and right now food banks need our support more than ever: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-51837892    All ticket holders will be offered refunds. But ideally we would still like to raise the money we would have made in ticket sales from these two gigs to help the two food banks they would have supported.    We have set our target amount roughly at 80% of all available tickets sold to both events which would have been £2 560. We will split any money raised from this drive between Eat or Heat  The Waltham Forest Food Bank (Canned Laughter - April 25th) and Euston Food Bank (Canned Laughter: Karaoke Roulette - April 4th)    We thank you so much for your support.

Our family were in awe by his altruistic desire to give  feed and aid ALL  despite race/ethnicity/religion among him even whilst suffering himself.     Since opening  our family alone have vetted 25 families with monthly food rations from December 2019- present. Unfortunately  25 families do not cover the innumerable amount of people starving  for whom we want to share some light  hope and nurture to amidst dark times  that is their indefinite reality.    Our foodbank prioritises poor families with children  single mothers/widowers and those who themselves or their children suffer with debilitating mental/physical health issues trying to make ends meet to provide for their children- this is done with rigorous checks by our team to ensure nobody exploits such a service. The families are issued with a monthly ration card valid for 12 months which provides them with stock for each month as per the individual needs of the family. These include: 10kg chapati flour (atta)  5kg sugar  5kg various lentils/daal  5kg rice  5L cooking oil  tea leaves  salt  spices and other necessary food items. £25 will feed a family of 5 for the month however any donation  no matter how big or small will impact them greatly.     100% of the donationsgo to those in need  with our incredible staff being voluntary workers (so no wages or salaries are deducted from donations) and our facilities funded with the finances that the late Safdar Hussain Shah left behind for us to carry this out in his legacy- we are relying on your kind donations which will solely provide stock for the families.     During the current COVID-19 crisis  we are aiming to try and provide emergency food supplies to all those suffering in the locale  with the most vulnerable holding priority  we are giving out thousands of food rations but are broken to see that we are unable to extend our help to everyone that needs it- as a small start-up charity  we are grateful for all the support and donations we receive in order to help us reach as many individuals suffering from the crisis as possible.     Unfortunately  we can't do this alone  with the power of unity together we can help fill the stomachs of the poor  not only with food but also the fulfilment of life and hope they may gradually receive from your donations. Our brothers and sisters around the globe need us  we are united by our efforts.   Any donation  no matter how big or small will be greatly appreciated especially in the blessed month of Ramadan  whereby charity is considered its greatest.     We are not the givers  we are just Allah SWT  the Almighty's  servants and can only give what he allows and wishes to be given. The families we aim to feed is by the grace of Allah SWT and it is he who provides to all.     May Allah SWT accept this from you and me  may we fulfil our duty by helping those in need  for which it is their right upon you and I.    “A man’s true wealth is the good he does in this world.” Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W)    Instagram: sadaqajariya.foodbank for further updates",True

Our local community urgently needshelp and support to tackle one of the very basic but very real challenges they are facing; that of feeding their families.     Some young people and their families live in poverty all year round  but we are finding  because of the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis  so many more are contacting us because they’re struggling with increased pressures on their household budgets. People who are battling with job losses  reduction in their incomes  wait times/not being eligible to receive benefits  an increase in utility bills etc during lockdown and ultimately children that go hungry. There are also vulnerable people in our community that need help; ie elderly  disabled  those shielding for health reasons or in self isolation who haven’t got anyone else to help them. We know these impacts will be felt long term.    Every penny you donate counts. It will help us achieve our foodbank project’s aims of reducing food poverty and inequality. It will help us tackle some of the very real challenges young people  the disadvantaged and vulnerable in our community are facing right now. Alternatively  you may have or work at a business that can offer us some support or help - if you have any ideas around this  please contact us at letseatproject@yahoo.com    We want to make a difference and help families put healthy food on the table  and we are grateful for any help you can give us to make this happen and make something positive come from this difficult time in the longer term.

To achieve this though we need your help to raise the funds to buy essential equipment such as suitable fridge/freezers (approx £2500) so we can receive more food and improve the food parcels  to improve our available storage spaces (costs for this are currently being worked up  but to give you an idea we need an extra storage container  shelving/tables/materials/labour etc)  cover delivery costs for those that can’t come to us because they’re vulnerable/disabled/elderly/isolating etc  to buy bags  gloves  sanitisers etc and to stock up on food and household goods that families in financial crisis need support with getting at this time. We are working in partnership with FareShare Yorkshire.   We want to make a community food store that can make a difference. This is a project that we have begun operating immediately to react to this crisis and meet the growing need for help for families to feed themselves  but also one we want to develop  grow and make sustainable in the long term. Locally and nationally the demand for support in communities to reduce food  child  and working poverty is  sadly  an increasing trend with no signs of slowing. We also want to break down some of the social stigmas in the community that are associated with the use of food banks and make it easier for families to get the help they need.    Usually our charity is able to generate some income through some of our already heavily subsidised youth activities (we offer our activity sessions e.g. football  rubgy  boxing etc for £2 a time) - but this has currently come to a crashing halt to keep people safe! Also a lot of the grants and corporate fundraising methods have been put on hold or are under severe strain due to increased demand. We have to find a different way of fundraising during COVID-19 - and let’s just say Captain Tom was an inspiration to us! So here we are  hoping you can offer your support.    Thanks for reading our appeal. If you can’t donate yourself  maybe you can share our story so someone else might help. Either way  we hope you all stay safe  well and blessed! ❤️ ",True

Currently  there is a huge need to help support the food banks  as so many people are needing additional help  to put food on the table  which is where the idea came from.    Many people leading up to the bank holiday would be planning where they are going to stay overnight camping or in their vans or on holiday  sadly for the VE-Day weekend that can no longer happen. So why dont we celebrate at home ?    So the idea is simple plan your trip based at home  prepare everything you need to go camping  stay overnight on the drive in your van  a tent in your garden  or even in your house (but it must be set up like a camping trip)  or in your caravan.     So how do we raise funds ?   Donate a minimum of £5 in the pot or the amount you would normally have paid for a night camping at your favourite spot during the bank holiday weekend.  If local to Nailsea  the money will go to food bank in Nailsea  if not to the national food bank network  every £ will make a difference.    Its not just about fundraising  so let's have some fun  go to town decorating your place of accommodation  take pictures  upload them to the Facebook page  use your imagination to have an amazing night or more 'away at home!'",True

I have been keeping these two jerseys to one day get framed and put them up on my wall. They mean a lot to me as anyone who knows football will know the magnitude of “that” game. During lockdown I made a decision to put them to a good cause and raise money for people who really need it most. I will always have the memories and with help from everyone we can hopefully raise a nice amount. Please donate or purchase a ticket. We can all play a little part so all donations are welcome but to enter its £15 for one ticket. No limit on tickets purchased.     Stay safe and healthy    Thank you    Billy xxx",True

The work this school is doing is phenomenal and I feel so privileged to be able to experience this  and I am already looking forward to the next 2 and a half weeks to come!    The object of the project is to teach English to the children in the village  so they have better job prospects than just rice farming  sweatshop work or prostitution. They also run a food bank project  helping some of the poorest families to become self sustainable and giving them food packages that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford.    The last few weeks teaching has been a real eye opener  and one of my highlights so far has been teaching my pre intermediate class all about women’s rights and gender inequality  they are so willing to learn it’s infectious.    I am asking for donations to be able to treat our children on Fun Friday  as lots of them have extremely hard lives and so this fortnightly treat is something they really look forward to! Any remaining money left over from fun Friday will go straight to the food bank project.     Many thanks",True

The individual /individuals have taken tablets that were used for referrals to the fuel bank to enable those in crisis to receive an emergency payment and for a nationwide surveys into foodbank from Edinburgh university. They have taken our main hard drive /pc all are password protected . They have obviously ransacked the office and damaged our filing cabinets. Along side the items we need to replace   they have taken around £200 that was donated over the Christmas period which obviously provides much needed funds for the day to day running of the foodbank. Food was taken too  so we are putting an appeal out for tinned fish  rice pudding  tinned fish   tinned tomatoes and uht milk.   We as a charity can little afford the extra costs incurred to replace the more valuable items and office furniture. Any donations will be greatly received and used to help to wider community .      As stated our original target was £1000 and we have blown away by the generosity of the wider public. I am one of the merry band of volunteers at Oldham Foodbank. We offer assistance to those in crisis with food parcels for 3 days . As we have smashed our target   extra money raised will be used to enhance our current security systems to prevent ourselves from being targeted again . Furthermore the money raised will secure day to day expenses of the Foodbank for the foreseeable future   enabling us to continue to provide to those in need and crisis.   All monies raised is to be transferred to Oldham Foodbank bank account which is run by our Trustees.     Update on 17/5/19     We are in the process of withdrawing funds   The funds will be withdrawn via the manager of the Foodbank and promptly transferred to the Oldham Foodbank account which the Trustees will be able to allocate funds as we require them .   Once again Thank you   a photo showing the transfer and statement will be placed via this page for transparency.     ",True

The fall off in food donations caused by the Covid-19 crisis and the jump in demand that we have seen for the service has meant that we have had to start buying food and other essential products. This  together with the need to move to a delivery model and the widening of the geographical area served  has increased our costs significantly. A financial donation will enable supplies to be purchased and distributed to those who are struggling and vulnerable. A food parcel for an individual for one week costs £14  or £18 with toiletries. All donations will go directly to purchasing items for food parcels.

Personllay I feel ensuring that foodbanks have adequate food to help the most vulnerable in our community is a priority.     There are 5 foodbanks in my local area which last year issued 64.1 tonnes of food  the equivalent of 128 000 packs of 500g bags of pasta. They feed 7 669 clients of which 3 065 are children.    My Challenge:  I am a keen cyclist and due to Covid-19 outbreak my usual social and competitive cycles have been impacted. So to keep motivated I am going to attempt to complete 10 back to back training sessions all from my virtual trainer.    To complete the training sessions I will use a virtual app called Sufferfest   which as the name suggests is a festival of suffering. On a normal day one session is tough so completing 10 back to back will be challenging.    To help me get through the agony and anguish (and saddle sores) I would greatly appreciate any donation you can make towards the foodbank so they can continue their fantastic work in our community.

This is a project that helps the local community. Due to certain circumstances  our original plan was rejected by our leaders. Consequently we have created a new plan.    Our new project consists of two parts.     Part one: we will be volunteering at Colchester Foodbank on Wednesday 21st August. Here we will do a litter pick around moorside business park and we will be sorting out food products stores at the warehouse.    Part two: we will be going into Highwoods Community Centre where we will be working in Squirrels Pre School to freshen it up and make it more appealing to the eye both inside and out. This will include: painting the sheds  clearing between the sheds  clearing weeds  a general tidy up and if we raise enough we will replace the old bamboo fencing.     We are hopping to raise around £500. This money will be split equally between Squirrels Pre School and Colchester Foodbank after taking away any expenditures including paint and ingredients for the fundraisers. In order to raise this money we will be doing a sponsored walk and swim from shrub end community & sport centre to lesiure world and back with an hour swim this Friday 16th August. We will also be doing a bake sale in culver square on Tuesday 20th August from 10am-4pm.    We hope we can reach our target with your support.    Help us get to £500.    We hope to see you at our fundraisers!!    For more information on our fundraisers or how to sponsor us please message me.    Many thanks   Team 1",True

The food bank is available to all local residents  regardless of age.     During the current Covid-19 pandemic  some food banks have closed and others are operating at reduced capacity. Many elderly and vulnerable residents are unable to rely upon their usual channels of support and many in the community have been affected financially due to the crisis and are unable to meet their basic daily needs. The Square Mile Food Bank is therefore a critical resource to ensure that those most in need can be provided with urgent  nutritious food supplies.    The food bank is volunteer led and relies solely on donations from members of the community  companies and other grant giving bodies. Any donation  large or small  will make a huge difference to ensure that we are able to reach as many people as need the service.

Since the outbreak of Covid-19  we have drastically changed the way we are working. We have switched to delivery-only food parcels in Moulsecoomb & Bevendean  and have seen an increase in demand from the first week. With more than 50 households now on our delivery list  we are in constant need of food donations. Many kind people  organisations and businesses have supported us  but to make sure we are able to continue delivering to an ever-increasing amount of households in our area  we are now seeking more support to be able to buy in food and items we desperately need but not always get through donations. We know the need won't end when the outbreak and lockdown is over  and any funding will help us bridge to a way back to our drop-in sessions. We expect that even when the Food bank can open its doors again  and people can come out to socialise and get advice and support in person  the world will still look different  so we want to be prepared for this transition period.

These have all become luxury items nobody can seem to get their hands on without visiting multiple stores which not everyone can do.    Demand on resources has not been higher  so kindness  generosity and compassion for those around us in this time of need is more needed than ever before.    This has sparked an idea with the Digital Bees here at The Co-operative Bank - we must support individuals losing their jobs  vulnerable people unable to feed their families and anyone who is feeling the pain of the coronavirus pandemic which has hit the world. Food Banks feel huge pressures at Christmas  so you can't begin to imagine what they are dealing with to feed our nation.     As an ethical bank  this is something we feel very strongly about and we to offer whatever aid we can to the Greater Manchester community.    To support the physical donation campaign we are running  we are also taking online donations via this page.     “Unexpected kindness is the most powerful  least costly and most underrated agent of human change” – we all have a part to play in making these dark times more bearable for one another so please give what you can to this amazing heart-felt cause.    We also hope we inspire those outside of Greater Manchester to follow our movement and support your local community.    Thank you     Digital Bees - The Co-operative Bank",True

Over the last 2 years  I've done a couple of twitch streams to raise money for my local Trussell Trust foodbank - You can get more information about their important work and see my two previous campaigns here:    10 Hour Stream for the Foodbank - 2018  10 Hour Stream for my local Foodbank 2017    Sadly  as the pressure on the foodbanks continue to mount here in the UK  I am once again back to do silly things on the internet for 10 hours to raise money for charity -     Only THIS year  there's a bit of a twist!  We have a new family member! Meet Petie:      Petie was taken in by the amazing people over at Dogs Trust Leeds after he had been repeatedly attacked in his previous home. He is a senior dog who just needed a stable and safe retirement home  and we were more than happy to help!    Going through the process of adopting Petie really opened my eyes to the exceptional work that goes on behind the scenes at Dogs Trust. I decided pretty quickly that I wanted to give back to them somehow in the near future.    So this 10 hour art stream will be a bit different than my previous two!    I will need to take a break to go for a walk with Petie  so the stream will briefly go offline for that  but I'll make up for that time by streaming a bit later! Whatever money is raised will be split evenly and donated to Trussell Trust foodbank Leeds and Dogs Trust!     If you have a few pounds spare  please consider helping us out!   And join our art stream on the 24th of October from 8am (UK Time) at https://www.twitch.tv/jeninator !     Thank you for taking the time to read this and have a lovely day <3 ",True

SO I went to Tesco to buy some food for us hoping to donate some too. But there was no food to give so I thought I could give my donation in financial terms - thus allowing Yeovil Christian Support Trust to top up their own surplus and use my gift as they require. Perhaps you would consider doing the same. Could you spare a fiver to help top up the food bank and other groups the Lords larder helps.

Statistics taken from The Trussel Trust:    Between 1st April 2017 and 31st March 2018  The Trussell Trust’s foodbank network distributed 1 332 952 three day emergency food supplies to people in crisis  a 13% increase on the previous year. 484 026 of these went to children.    So if you are one of the lucky ones who can afford to spare a small amount  please think about sharing it with those who can't. Really  I would appreciate any donation. Plus  I need to get my bum up that mountain so please give me a little boost to get up there!     The climb will take place on June 15th 2019 (weather depending).    Thank you    Love  Zoe x    PS: I hope to be the first person to twist a balloon dog at the top :D      **Emma is raising funds for our local children's nursery.

I hope you're doing OK in these tough & uncertain times.     Today marks 2 months since lockdown measures were introduced in the UK. It's difficult to concisely describe the upheaval that's ensued in the wake  imparting job losses on many of the poorest low paid workers in our society. Despite lockdown putting an end to my own plans to go and coach tennis in Tamil Nadu  India for an eye-opening experience  my eyes are very much open to the far greater losses others have endured.    Thus  I had a think as to how I could help in my own way  in the covid-triggered absence of typical in-person volunteering that I love to fill my spare-time with; cycling was a no-brainer  given how much I love rolling on two wheels while promoting the mental & physical benefits of regular exercise.     However  I was also aware that  given how much time I spend on the bike  I needed to push the bounds a bit to make the activity more of a sacrifice than simply another training session; especially in light of the sacrifice our key workers are making every day in keeping the country ticking.    Henceforth  I arrived at the 300km target. Beyond the fact that it provides nice mathematical symmetry to an achievable fundraising goal for 1 week  it's over double of my usual biweekly training ride (135k). I'm undertaking it in my garden on the turbo in order to have a sustainable source of water & nutrition (especially given the covid-triggered closure of beloved cafes in my chilterns!). It'll likely take 11-12 hours to complete dependent on temperature  and will be by far & away my biggest ride to date! (Smashing the mountainous 170km I rode in the Dolomites last year!) I expect it to be quite painful after the 7 hour mark  and have been meticuklously been planning my playlist to distract from the intense quad-muscle fatigue.    Now onto the important bit; why I'm doing it? Foodbanks were already an issue of crisis in the UK before we entered this new world; between 2018 and 2019  the Trussell Trust delivered 1.6m emergency 3-day food parcels  a 19% increase on the previous year; more shockingly  annual use of the TT's services has risen 73% over 5-years  with children attributed to around a THIRD of the demand.    I've been very loud in recent times about the heightened importance of (safe) outdoor exercise right now  due to the power it holds in fighting depressive emotions and protecting our health (and subsequently  the pressured health service). But  there is no escaping the fact; if people cannot put food on the table  they cannot access these benefits; indeed  malnutrition takes more away from them than simply the ability to run 10k; 500k children arrive at school hungry each day  vastly limiting their potential to achieve highly and rise up the precarious social mobility ladder.    Thanks so much for reading this mini-essay; I hope it's struck a chord with you and provided a bitesized insight into the critical issue of food poverty today. It is saddening to contemplate  but the pandemic's dual attack on low-paid employment and public service provisions in the likely future austerity-era will only make the above figures worse. I'm aware of the awkwardness of asking for donations during such a financially-challenging time  but if you consider yourself privileged and would be able to make a contribution  I would be most grateful.

an unprecedented challenge. It is important  in this moment  that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has launched to support our community and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.    The Lambeth Food Bank Fund     Right now we are all feeling scared and vulnerable  but there are many among us that will need more support  from food banks to food delivery and far beyond.    In Lambeth we have a history of looking after one another - and that spirit has never been more important than right now.     So we are creating something called the Lambeth Food Bank Fund and its aim is to ensure those in need at this difficult time are being looked after.     Our borough has some exceptional people and projects that help individuals in need every day. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has been set up for us to help ensure they have the funding in place to continue their work at this incredibly difficult time.     Please  even during these unprecedented circumstances  we ask that - if possible - you donate and contribute to the common good of Lambeth. We know that so much is uncertain for us all right now but the smallest contribution can make the biggest difference.      * * *    FAQs    What can I do?    Right now because of the severity of the situation  the single most important thing we can do is try to raise money  so that we are able to help the most vulnerable.     Where will the funds go?    The funds will go to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by Holy Trinity Clapham and delivered to food banks across the borough - including Brixton & Norwood  Clapham Park  Vauxhall  and Waterloo - that can help the most vulnerable.     If I do donate will it go to those who need it?     Yes  your donation will go to those who need it. Unlike other platforms  GoFundMe do not charge a fundraising fee although they take a small transaction fee. See here for more details. You do not need to leave a 'tip' if you don't want to.     I want to help my local community  will this money be spent in Lambeth?     Yes.     Where can I find accurate information about covid-19?     For general information on CV-19  please visit the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response    Lambeth Council have some useful information: https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/elections-and-council/about-lambeth/coronavirus-covid-19-information    If you are worried about your own health  call the NHS on 111.",True

For a lot of you out there this is probably easy peasy but for me this is MY Everest!!! My aim is to raise at least £100 for Omagh's Food Bank Appeal as I have seen people who receive this help and it does make a world of difference to them its the difference between having a warm meal or going hungry so I want to try and do a wee bit to help if I can. All donations are welcome and when May is over I will give all money to the organisers of the Food Bank and they will go to the shop and use 100% of the money and buy the needed necessitates for local people.",True

We are a self funded food bank located on the Isle of Bute.   We have a mainly elderly community who because of coronavirus have had to self isolate. We are delivering food which is firstly hard to come by. The increase in need in the last week has more than doubled. We cannot keep up and we need help to meet these demands. Because of the need for delivering food we have had to stop picking up donated furniture to sell. The schools close next week we are concerned for our community. We can not close. please Help us help our community. https://www.facebook.com/buteoasis2/ visit our Facebook page and see what we do  7 days a week. ",True

We reached out for food and money donations from our loyal friends and followers and started to deliver food hampers to those who needed it most.     Our initial plan was to provide some food hampers over a 2-week period  or when the donations ran out. However  once we started this work  we observed how much hardship there is within the community and really wanted to continue and provide as much support as is possible.     We have since been fortunate to receive some generous funding . The funding has enabled us to reach out to local schools  churches  council groups and other community organisations to identify families who would massively benefit from a food hamper during these difficult times. To date we have provided over 1500 food hampers to family’s within Northampton  and the demand for this support is increasing daily.

Here at Bubble Food our volunteers are working with Southwark Council on a food initiative supporting the Fridge and Food Bank at St George the Martyr Church.    Our target is to produce 100 nourishing meals a day which will cost £450.00 in ingredients. We are initially aiming to support the food bank for at least a month.    Bubble will be donating our kitchen premises  chefs and all food packaging to make this possible. We are hoping to get support from our clients  friends and family to purchase fresh produce to make the meals.     Your donations  no matter how small  will collectively help feed the most vulnerable in the local community to help ensure no one is forgotten.    Love Team Bubble Food x",True

Whilst I wasn't going to do this for charity  I have decided to try to raise some funds to help support the Food Bank set up at North Denes Primary School in Great Yarmouth. The Food Bank was set up in 2018 after a child passed a note to a teacher  asking for help as their mother had no food. The full BBC News article can be read by using the link below. Its 2019  no child should ever go hungry  and this story is heartbreaking. If you can spare a couple of pounds  it will go a long way to helping families in need. I may take twice as long as Mo Farah to complete the GNR  but you can be assured I will complete it with every ounce of strength I have and with a smile on my face!    https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-48119099",True

Many people have already lost their jobs  or they are in a state of uncertainty while awaiting news  and self-employed workers are finding themselves in a similar position - many are asking for a referral to a food bank for the very first time.    We are getting reports from the ground that food donations are gradually slowing down  and so at Essex Coronavirus Action we are raising funds to provide immediate payments to a number of food banks around Essex for the purchase of food and supplies. We are also in discussions with a number of retailers to make sure that food banks can purchase the items that they are running short of  while still managing to respect the new guidelines about reserved shopping hours for those who need them.    Every donation will be held in a bank account in the name of the Essex Association Of Local Councils  in trust on behalf of Essex County Council  ready for direct distribution to local food banks across the county.    Essex Coronavirus Action is a collaboration between Essex County Council  The Essex Public Health Team  and local Facebook groups across Essex.

We would like those of you who are not experiencing financial hardship  to consider donating a weeks bus fare  petrol  parking charges  or whatever you can afford. Given most businesses have implemented some form of home working  many may not have incurred these costs.    Donations will be shared across the 15 food banks in the Sheffield network.

Some of the people we are helping are on benefits  and are elderly and vulnerable. A lot of them can't get out of the house because they are self-isolating and have no one else to do the shopping for them.    We are desperate to keep on supporting them but we need food donations.    For more information visit the Elias Mattu Foundation's Facebook page  or call Asha Mattu on 07904 310530.

The work that we do is adapting quickly in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. One of the most important changes to our offering is a new emergency food bank  to ensure that those who are vulnerable or isolated are able to access food and supplies during this difficult time.    Donations given through this fundraiser will go towards purchasing necessary items for emergency packages  and supporting distribution to those unable to leave their homes. Each session costs the organisation around £80 in food and deliveries - our target of £3400 would allow us to run the food bank for a full year  through this crisis and the months that will follow.    In this worrying and uncertain time it is crucial that those in our communities who are most vulnerable are looked after. Your donations will go towards ensuring that those in need have access to essential supplies.

The island is an island of tourism  many of the inhabitants come from the other islands in Cape Verde to work and rely on the wealth of the world for their survival. The island is poor at the best of times  relying solely on tourism. The wages are low but the cost of living is the same as the UK  if not more. Some essential items like Paracetamol can cost an average of £5 per packet  completely unaffordable by the locals. Like the rest of the world  the island is now in quarantine  but this means the islanders are not allowed to leave to travel back to their native islands and live with their families. Without tourism  the locals are without wages and money or financial aids to support themselves - yet are expected to live and survive on next-to-nothing. There have been a few charities set up and have already started to hand out some food to the families  but it's not enough. With majority of supplies coming from overseas and high demand  the local shops have doubled their prices  so food is considerably more expensive and unafforadable for most. My daughter  Chiara often says to me ""Mum  you can't save everybody"" and of course I know she's right. Whilst I know money is tight in the UK and around the world  I just cannot ignore how these locals  who depend on the rest of the world must feel. I feel compelled to try to help them  hence this ""gofundme"" page. The monies will go directly to the locals to buy basic food  of rice  vegetables  water and supplies and distributed to the families in need. I hope you will consider their plight and help  any small donation will help and be a significant difference to those who need it the most. There will be difficult months ahead until tourism replenishes the island again  but they are the most fantastic and beautiful hosts. The islanders of Boa Vista will welcome you and any guests with open arms  today and always - so much you will never want to leave their beautiful island. Lastly  I thank you for taking the time to read this on behalf of the locals whom depend on tourism for survival. Myself  like everyone else really hope we can all return to what was once normal life soon  but in the meantime let’s do our best to look after those who treat us with nothing but love and kindness. Much Love Bruna. This is a request for help  on behalf of Igor Tequila and the Islanders on Boa Vista https://www.gofundme.com/f/boa-vista-food-bank",True

I work for an NHS Older People Community Mental Health Team; so my clients are generally over the age of 70 and have diagnosis such as anxiety  depression  schizophrenia and dementia.    Many of my clients are self-isolating  and lots of them have family or carers that are doing their food shopping  so they are well supported.    However  quite a few of our clients live by themselves or with their elderly husband or wife  with no other support. These are the people my colleagues and I are most worried about. They are unsupported and at high risk.    As you know there has been an amazing volunteer movement in response to Corona Virus lockdown. However  due to red tape issues the volunteers aren't being linked with our clients in need of this support as quickly as we'd like.    My colleagues and I have set up a mini food bank to help our most vulnerable clients whilst we wait for volunteer support to be put in place.    I know times are hard but please please give a donation  of whatever you feel you can  so we can help our most vulnerable clients live through their self-isolation.    If there is any food or money leftover after this crisis will be donating it to a food bank charity.    Thank you so much!!!!!",True

I know it's scary and seeing others stock up on canned goods and toilet roll may be pushing you into wanting to do the same but I implore you to remain calm and think of others during this difficult time. If you are healthy enough to get to a grocery shop and buy fresh food please do so  if you have friends/family around you who could easily bring you groceries if you have to self isolate please do so  if you are able to utilise online shopping while isolating please do so and leave food on the shelves for those who desperately need it.

We used to provide top-up food for around 25 families who were on benefits  we are now trying to provide a full week’s supply of food to around three times that number of families  many of whom have very little or no income at all at the moment; at a time when it is much harder to obtain food.     To prevent people in our community going hungry we are having to purchase additional food every week.     We have no ongoing funding for the Food Bank apart from the 50p voluntary donation that users make for their food; and the supplies we get from FareShare  which whilst excellent  can not meet all our community's food needs in this crisis.     In the last weeks we have spent on average about £800 more each week to obtain the food needed for the Food Bank; our reserves will soon be completely spent. We need more money if we are going to continue supplying people in food poverty in our community with the food they desperately .

We are an Ecuadorian family who wants to kick-start a fundraiser for the Latin American community in London  who have been directly or indirectly impacted by the coronavirus and find themselves and their families in crisis economically being pushed below the poverty line.         What we would like to do?  We would like to raise funds so we can buy and collect food supplies and toiletries and give them to those who are in need in the Latin American community.  We need the funds urgently and continuously for the next three months at least whilst the covid-19 crisis stabilises.       Why is this important?  As the lockdown in London began in a matter of days  we fear many Latin American people in London  equally as the rest of Londoners  are suffering greatly  many may have either lost their jobs as many work in hospitality and catering or may be waiting on what's next for them once lockdown eases. Many may be now below the poverty line suddenly.       What do we need?  Cash donations allow us to buy food at low prices directly via our chain of suppliers  or  Food and toiletries donations  or  vehicles (cars  bikes  vans) to collect and deliver food and toiletries parcels      Support us!  We Latinos are supportive and charitable  welcoming to those in need  so let's get together turning an uncertain situation into an opportunity to help each other.  We hope that other Latin American organisations and institutions  leaders  such as Cllr Maria Linforth-Hall Southwark & Directora de “Su Mano Amiga”  Cllr Belgica Guaña  businesses and the normal Latin person in the street join us. Let the 'invisibles' be seen and help. We can make a true difference at this time and let's not forget we all need a hand sometimes.    We are very grateful for all your help!   ¿Quiénes somos?  Somos una familia ecuatoriana que busca poner en marcha una campaña de recaudación de fondos para la comunidad latinoamericana en Londres  afectada directa o indirectamente por la crisis relacionada al Covid-19. Existen miles de familias que hoy atraviesan un momento crítico económicamente y cuyas finanzas han sido empujadas por debajo del umbral de pobreza.    ¿Qué nos gustaría hacer?  Estamos trabajando en la recaudación de fondos para poder adquirir y recoger suministros útiles para el diario vivir  como alimentos y artículos de aseo  para su entregárselos a las personas más necesitadas en la comunidad latinoamericana.  Para hacerlo  buscamos fondos de forma urgente con miras a continuar con la campaña los próximos tres meses  que serán críticos  y al menos hasta que la crisis se estabilice.    ¿Por qué es importante?  Debido a que las restricciones en Londres iniciaron repentinamente  tememos que muchos latinoamericanos en la ciudad  igual que el resto de londinenses  están sufriendo mucho. La posibilidad de que miles hayan perdido sus trabajos debido a la naturaleza de sus empleos (muchos trabajan en el sector hotelero y gastronómico) y la incertidumbre sobre el futuro de ese sector laboral en los próximos meses acentúa este momento crítico y  de repente  los enfrenta a niveles preocupantes de pobreza.    ¿Qué necesitamos?  Las donaciones en efectivo nos permiten comprar alimentos a precios bajos y más convenientes  directamente  a través de nuestra cadena de proveedores  O  Donaciones de alimentos y artículos de aseo  O  Transporte (coches  bicicletas  furgonetas) para recoger y entregar paquetes de alimentos y artículos de aseo    ¡Apóyanos!  Los latinos nos caracterizamos por nuestra solidaridad  somos caritativos  empáticos y siempre damos una mano a quienes más los necesitan. Esta es una nueva oportunidad para reunirnos y convertir una situación incierta en una oportunidad para ayudarnos unos a otros.    Esperamos que otras organización es e instituciones latinoamericanas y líderes  como la Cllr María Linforth-Hall Southwark y Directora de “Su Mano Amiga”  Cllr Bélgica Guaña Newham  empresas y la persona latina normal en la calle se unan a nosotros. Que quienes hoy son ""invisibles"" sean vistos y nos ayuden a ayudar. Podemos hacer una verdadera diferencia en este momento al no olvidar que todos necesitamos una mano a veces.    ¡Estamos muy agradecidos por toda su ayuda!    ",True

Fortunately for most of us this is only a temporary situation.     Sadly many families have been financially hit hard by the lockdown. In particular the Refugee and Asylum Seeker community have not been able to work in lockdown and are not eligible for benefits and furlough pay. They have had to rely on Food Banks because they can't afford to shop at the supermarket; and the demand for these services is growing rapidly.     Barnet Refugee Services set up a Food Bank in North London (Edgware) at the beginning of lockdown to ensure Asylum Seekers and Refugee families don't go hungry. In their first week of opening they provided food packages to 120 households  and now there are over 200 families depending on this service.

After a succesful shop for The Axminster Food Bank Christmas 2018 and another for The Salvation Army Christmas 2019  we were hoping to do one at the beginning of the year  however in the light of Covid-19 we feel like this is a critical time to pull together to try and support our local communities and those most vulnerable.

This vital local resource has seen an overwhelming increase in demand since the onset of COVID-19. In April alone   the Community Fridge provided vital ‘food support ‘ to over 500 families across West Lothian.           These families are facing real ‘gut wrenching ‘ hardship and the Community Fridge has seen an unprecedented demand for the vital support they provide . This is a difficult time for everyone in society but some families are facing the daily challenge of accessing food and supplies for their children and the most vulnerable in our local community . It is no exaggeration to say they are quite literally relying on food banks like the Community Fridge to survive.           John and Grant are local boys who truly understand the area and the daily challenges and choices local families are facing and how these challenges have been further amplified by this pandemic.           Their personal and professional ethos is unselfishly about helping others   providing support and a ‘helping hand’ wherever they can. The thought of vulnerable families and young children going without access to food saddens and terrifies them . Through ‘More Than Fitness’ they’ve routinely provided support to the fridge. Over the last 3 months they’ve put on ‘food bank bootcamps’   free online classes for companies in return for a food bank donations and much more . However   they both realise this current situation requires a much bigger effort and response .           So   these extraordinary times and the associated local need will result in an extraordinary effort from both !           This challenge is a further continuation of their efforts to strive to achieve an outcome where families across West Lothian and Edinburgh have access to the food they need. To ensure no family or individual has to face the nightmare scenario of not being able to feed themselves  their children   or vulnerable relatives . These families should not have to go without   no one should.          Please support the guys at ‘More Than Fitness’ and help raise much needed funds to support the Community Fridge at Ladywell Baptist Church. No family should have to worry about where their next meal is coming from   a small donation in support of the guys can help take that worry away . Thank you !",True

We are Forty Clothing from Glasgow  and we’re trying to do our bit during these harrowing times.      Every Saturday since the lockdown began  our Managing Director and DJ extraordinaire Harry has been entertaining our customers and followers alike from the comfort of his own home. For one hour a week he plays his favourite tunes in the hope of brightening people’s weekends while we’re all stuck in the house. We’ve also been trying to promote health and safety and social distancing through our social channels to all of our amazing followers and offering free gifts with orders placed on our website  as well as starting our weekly Big Forty Quarantine Quiz as our way of helping and putting smiles on the faces of others at this time.      But we realise that more has to be done. At this time  people and businesses are struggling. People have lost their jobs and their income  others have no childcare and support. Many people are struggling with both their physical and mental health. Key workers are risking their lives every day  often in low-paid jobs. Charities are losing out on the vital donations they need to maintain the incredible work they do.       We’d love to help these people in some way  and for this reason we are raising money for a food bank drive. Food banks are there to help those who are struggling no matter the cause  and provide them with the basic necessities they need to survive. While times are tough for us all  food bank volunteers are continuing to do their bit for society  and although we all wish there was no need for food banks in our society the sad truth is that many people rely on them to get by - and at this time they may be more stretched than usual.      Every week we will support a different food bank. Using the money raised  Harry will buy and donate the items requested by the food banks on behalf of all the Forty Family. We understand that times are tough right now for many of us  but if you do have anything to spare we would massively appreciate your help. We’ll also keep you all up to date with the process so you know that your donation has helped and made a difference to the lives of people here in Scotland.    The first food bank to benefit will be Newarthill Food Bank - from Harry’s hometown.      In the meantime  stay home  stay safe  stick together and stay apart!    Thank you and we’ll see you soon      Forty Clothing ❤️",True

Due to the pandemic  countless numbers of small and local businesses have been forced to close - with barbershops/hair salons being examples of the businesses that are suffering the most. Now  the normal response for the owner of a business like this would be to take advantage of rate relief  seek bridge funding for the business and also look for financial support being offered to people that are self-employed.    But not Ziggy...        Ziggy has converted the Barbershop into a Food Bank that is specifically focused on helping the elderly and other vulnerable members of the local community to have access to the food and sustenance they need in a time when it may be challenging to make trips to supermarkets or go shopping themselves.    We all know that local businesses like barbershops are massive pillars within communities as they are connected to so many people and aware of a range of local issues. So  who better and where better for a Food Bank to support vulnerable people to come from?        As it stands  Ziggy is not only travelling (on his own dime) to his shop  to the homes of people who cannot make it to his Food Bank and even spending his own money to buy food if he is short on donations from local people that are aware his Food Bank Exists. ALL WHILST HE IS LOSING MONEY AS HE CANNOT TRADE AND RUN HIS BUSINESS AS NORMAL.    So  now we need to support this local hero by helping to alleviate the financial pressure that comes from still having to maintain the utility costs at the shop  the transport costs that come with running the Food Bank and also to help access further food to support vulnerable local people.",True
