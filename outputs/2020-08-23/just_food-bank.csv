Last year, the Trussell Trust network gave out over 1.6 million three-day emergency food supplies to people in need, that’s a 19% increase on the previous financial year.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">When we started raising money for the Trussell Trust in 2017, 13 million people were living below the poverty line. Two years on, this number has grown to 14 million. People are going hungry every day for a range of reasons, from benefit delays (due to a drastically underfunded switch to universal basic income) to receiving an unexpected bill on a low income. This number is growing for a multitude of reasons but the responsibility lies in the same place each time. Our current government is failing us.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">Winter is always the busiest period for foodbanks, so we’d like your help to raise as much cash as possible. A tin of beans costs as little as 30p, so any donation you make however small or large will really help!</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">We wish that each year we wouldn't need to fundraise for this cause, it shouldn’t be down to the Trussell Trust (and many other similar organisations), there should be a system that supports and cares for people.</div><div dir=""auto""><br></div><div dir=""auto"">Please share this on all of your social platforms to help us achieve our goal.

,,,1188494,"Humanity First UK",False,2020-08-21,"In the UK there has been a 23% increase in the use of food banks. With the devastating effect of the Coronavirus on peoples jobs and income, the reliance of food banks has become far more evident. Latest figures by Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 177% increase in the number of people supported with 3-day emergency food parcels compared to May of last year.

Humanity First has set up its first UK Food Bank in Mirfield, West Yorkshire. A further roll out of other food banks is expected later this year. With local support they have managed to distribute food parcels to individuals and families as well as other food banks and organisations reaching a large number of people. 

However, to increase and expand the operation much needed donations required.

There has been almost no attention paid to the dire conditions people are forced to live in while in France.

Our organisation was set up as an emergency response project to provide food for displaced people across Calais when there were few services operating due to Covid-19. This emergency is ongoing.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>We are an organisation operating under the umbrella of L’Auberge des Migrants. With their help, we were able to set up and establish ourselves quickly, soon becoming a service people not only relied upon, but one which people trusted and enjoyed.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>Initially, the sole remit of The Calais Food Collective was to distribute dry food and cooking equipment so that people could cook for themselves. Our project provided people with autonomy over the food that they eat, as well as giving them the freedom to cook for themselves or amongst friends.&nbsp; We believe that cooking and eating communally brings communities together. In addition to the comfort cooking for yourself brings, the food that our service provides is varied, which means that everyone has access to a nutritionally balanced food source.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span><b>Since April, we have provided and distributed enough food for over 170,000 meals supporting close to 2,000 people through daily distributio</b>n.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>The current populations in Calais and Dunkirk constantly change, so we regularly adapt our service to respond to the volatile nature of the context we work in.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span></span></p><p><img src=""https://images.jg-cdn.com/image/f48e47bf-01b3-4295-89d2-fdb8f79c7e02.jpg""></p><p><span>Our service first operated as a ‘freeshop’: people could choose which items they take, and how much. Each time we distribute, we take different items to make sure there is a variety. Our service is culturally sensitive, for instance, we supported those observing Ramadan and aim to distribute additional items during religious holidays and celebrations. We listen to the communities and what they request, trying to meet peoples’ needs to the best that our budget allows.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span><img src=""https://images.jg-cdn.com/image/c06a7ad4-412c-4029-bba7-0aec4130fa26.jpg""><br></span></p><p><span>We founded this service with the help of the Woodyard, whose distribution of firewood gave people the means to cook our food. We would not have been able to achieve anything that we have without their support and cooperation.</span><br></p><p><span>On the 10th July, our service, as well all of the other organisations working throughout Calais, encountered an obstacle which is refusing to shift. One of the biggest evictions since the violent dismantling of the vilified and renowned ‘Calais Jungle’ in 2016. The 10th July saw the three biggest sites across Calais evicted during a single morning. People were forced onto buses, belongings were seized and destroyed, and fences were installed.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span></span></p><p><img src=""https://images.jg-cdn.com/image/aabb430c-d522-4dfe-8a27-4baf15c86ee4.jpg""></p><p><span>We responded in the best way that we could and spent the day searching for those still in Calais: needing food and support. After a few days of emergency responses, including cooking for over 1,000 in a makeshift kitchen and buying and distributing ready to eat items, a new camp formed. However, within 10 days this was also dismantled violently by police.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Since then, Calais has dissolved into a crisis of mass street homelessness. People can’t settle, access food or sleep rough without incessant police harassment.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>Due to the constant cycle of evictions, the Woodyard have had to suspend their services for the rest of the summer. As there are few permanent camps and settlements remaining, people can no longer make fires. This is amplified by the fact that many are residing in the streets of the city centre: street homelessness has surged across the city of Calais. We have rapidly adapted and changed the way that we work - shifting from solely providing dry food to working with partners on the ground to ensure everyone can access food and water.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span><img src=""https://images.jg-cdn.com/image/9a718d8a-45f7-42e3-910b-234d0b4aa4c5.jpg""><br></span></p><p><span>The state has an obligation to provide food. They do this in Northern France through a service called La Vie Active. However, since the outbreak of COVID-19 they have not satisfactorily fulfilled this obligation and their services and access points have drastically reduced. The largest access point for food has been closed since the start of the evictions on 10th July and shows no sign of reopening. The Calais Food Collective believes that denying food violates basic human rights. Since the start of the eviction we have campaigned for this service to resume alongside The Human Rights Observers (HRO), our partners on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>Water security has also been denied to people in Calais since the recent series of evictions. There is currently one water point available; it is an hour and a half walk away from where some people are staying and is surveyed by police which is a deliberate intimidation tactic. We have testimonies from people saying that accessing water at these points is not a risk they are willing to take, as they know that contact with the police means inevitable harassment and violence. Jerry cans and water containers are scarce as many were seized during the evictions. There is water available at the state food distributions, but only for the forty minutes in which they are distributing and often this service is suspended early or cancelled with very little warning.<b><span>&nbsp;</span>Due to this, we have started distributing bottles of water;<span>&nbsp;</span></b></span><span><b>we have distributed 12,600 litres in the past two weeks.</b></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>This is obviously a vast expense for us, but with 30 degree sun and no word from the state as to when they will adequately provide water there is very little option. In addition to distributing water, we are working with our partners Collective Aid to pursue legal action and pressure the local government to find a sustainable resolution.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>The situation in Northern France is volatile. We don’t know how it will change week-by-week. What we do know is that the hostile and violent policies of the French and British governments will not stop people from seeking asylum in the United Kingdom. These policies just make journeys more dangerous. We know that as a small, reactive and dynamic team we have the ability to respond to the situation as it changes. We have the responsibility to review and adapt the way we work to meet the current need. We are committed to ensuring that the people here receive the support and food security which right now is massively lacking. We are also committed to making visible the injustices perpetrated daily in Northern France.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>The British government is portraying people fleeing danger as criminals. Seeking safety is not a criminal act. Nobody should have to live in fear, without food or water.

We do not operate a voucher system, anybody who feels they need it can use our service. We try to offer fresh as well as non-perishable food where we can. Over the summer we have been located in Campsbourne School, and from September we will be located in Middle Lane Methodist Church. We grew out of Hornsey Mutual Aid, a group of local residents set up to help people in need during the COVID-19 Pandemic. We noticed a high degree of food poverty, and no foodbanks operate in the Hornsey area, so we got together to start this foodbank. All proceeds will go towards supporting the food bank.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank.

While I am fortunate enough to have a house over my head, and I can almost be a little choosy with what food I do buy, there are many people out there who were already suffering with lack of food access. And that was even before covid19 came along.

Well, I will also be supporting The Little Pricess Trust - my hair will be cut to meet their guideleines and I will store it until they are ready to accept donations. I have a lot of hair, and if I am going to do something to raise money whilst self distancing and isolating, why not do as much as I can?</p><p>If every friend I had on FB, LinkedIn and Instagram donated £1, then I would smash this target easily.

,,,1110522,"The Trussell Trust",False,2020-06-29,"<p>During lockdown, we completed the Girlguiding ‘Take Action - Make Change’ Skills Builder all about community action. Our final task was to develop a ‘pack’ of items that could be given to someone in need.</p><p>During our discussion we felt that because of the Covid-19 pandemic many families would be impacted by job losses or being furloughed that they may not be able to buy food and essentials and might need the services of a food bank. We researched food banks and discovered that last year, food banks in the Trussell Trust network alone provided more than 1.6 million emergency food parcels to people in crisis. More than half a million of these went to children.</p><p>With a budget of £5 we made a theoretical pack of supplies containing essential food items such as pasta, milk, oats, tinned vegetables and soups as well has household items such as detergent, shampoo and sanitary products. Adding in some treats such as lemonade and biscuits we were pleased with how far £5 could stretch. We felt inspired by our Skills Builder that we wanted to convert this into something real.</p><p>So, if you’re still reading this far, we are challenging ourselves to each run 50km or cycle 75km in total over the months of July &amp; August to raise money for the Trussell Trust, which has food banks all over the UK including in Woolwich and Plumstead where we live, and in normal times meet at Rangers.&nbsp;</p><p>Please consider sponsoring us for this physical challenge for a great cause.

This whole pandemic nonsense will hit those on low to no incomes the hardest and, right now, it’s tricky enough to find some of life’s essentials in the shops when you <i>can</i> afford them.</p><p>So as I sat here at home, unravelling at the prospect of being on lockdown, stuck inside, having to move house and have building work done in the midst of all of this, I realised I was being a bit of a whiny bitch.

,,,1140963,"FAST UK",False,2017-10-06,"<p>For the past three years FAST UK has helped to finance an emergency food bank for some of the poorest people and families living in the Rroma village called Apalina on the outskirts of Reghin. So far the charity has helped to feed over 200 families but we would love to help more!</p><p>After a past visit we were asked for some help by Pastor Attila Toth who informed us that many families within this village were trying to survive on just one or two small meals per week. In the summer months it is possible for families to survive on gleanings from locally grown crops but in winter with temperatures often dropping to as low as -32 degrees centigrade with snow on the floor this makes this way of living almost impossible.</p><p>With the money raised on this page as a charity we will send money to Attila so that he is able to purchase good basic food locally in Reghin. All of the food purchased will be given out to the most needy families according to the need.&nbsp;</p><p>On a recent visit this summer that I was on Attila told one of our trustees that the funds provided over the past few years have enabled people to have enough to eat through the harsh winters and in a few cases even prevent people from starving to death. After seeing the people living within the village in September 2017 and hearing many families stories, I feel very passionate about helping them and would love you to as well!</p><p>Currently the total we send to the food bank is £1500.00 per year but we would love to send more if possible so more people can be helped. The £1500.00 we give feeds approx 200 through the long winters which amounts to about £10 per person to see them through the whole winter period. This money not only enables people to eat but also to have a much easier time throughout the winter months as this is often the hardest time for families living in such a difficult environment and with so little.&nbsp;</p><p>Can you help some on eat well this winter for just £10?</p><p><font color=""#212121"">If you can help then that would be fantastic, remember&nbsp;no matter how much you can donate, every pound helps to feed a person for a day, week, month and winter.</font></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

,,,SC033690,"First Base Agency",False,2016-08-16,"<p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p><strong>AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE FOR ANY PATRIOTIC SCOTTISH DOG!</strong></p><p>OK, fair enough. This is a bit nuts. A lot nuts actually. See the picture of the blue football shirt? Well, it ain't just any football shirt. It is a Scotland shirt for the discerning, patriotic smaller Scottish dog. Believe it or not we have had forty of these donated and they are all in serious need of a good home.</p><p>Well in&nbsp;a few days time Scotland will be taking on the Auld Enemy at Wembley and your wee pooch must be desperate to wear the colours. So here's the good news. If you were to give any kind of donation to this page one of these canine shirts might just find its way to you in the post so long as you give me a bell on 077770 443483 to sort it out.</p><p>Yeah, I know. But these are times when frontline charities like First Base need to clutch at every straw we can find!</p><p><strong>ABOUT ME LIVING OFF ONE OF OUR FOOD PARCELS.</strong></p><p>I really don't want to make any kind of big deal out of what I'm doing here! I guess in a way I am about to put my money where my mouth is. In September I will live off one of the First Base Agency's emergency food parcels for half a week.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the picture above. I know. It isn't going to be so very hard, right?. And it shouldn't be so very hard. All of us at First Base are pretty proud of the emergency food parcels we have been handing out for the last 13 years. We are very much aware that the REALLY hard part of living off emergency food is being in a position where you NEED to live off emergency food. It is a very bleak place indeed to find yourself in. We see this every single day in the eyes of those who come into First Base.</p><p>I am lucky. I don't need emergency food. Not right now at least. So I am not asking for your support for any kind of recognition of me doing something remotely difficult. Instead I am asking for support for something much more profound. Over the coming eight months of winter over 3000 people will come through the doors of First Base. Each and every one of them will be in the miserable position of finding themselves unable to buy food to eat. And we will all do our very best to make sure each and every person who comes to us will leave the building with a bag full of the kind of food I am about to live off for a few days.</p><p>But there is a problem. A pretty big problem. As I write these words we have enough funding in place to just about keep the doors open until the end of December. Then nothing. January nothing. February nothing. March nothing. Three long, cold winter months when hundreds and hundreds of people will need us to be there to provide emergency food.</p><p>Sadly this is a problem we are only too familiar with. Every frontline charity in Britain knows how it is to live on the edge of a funding cliff. It is hard and it is stressful. Our local community is utterly amazing when it comes to donating food. Last year we received over £40,000's worth. When I spend my three days eating emergency food I will be lucky enough to have a fresh loaf of bread donated by Greggs and a pack of ham donated by Brown Brothers. The list of our food donors is a long one and we feel honoured to be supported by so many.</p><p>However the bags of food that arrive every day will never pay our electric bill. Or the phone bill. Or the rent. Or wages. Or the detailed accounts we are legally and rightly obliged to produce for the charity regulator. Or fuel in the tank to deliver made up food parcels to the 20 collection points we bow have across the region.</p><p>These are the boring bills which cover the nuts and bolts of keeping the doors of any front line charity open. They are boring but unavoidable. And the money to cover these boring bills is our life blood. By hook or by crook we need to find £20,000 before the end of March to ensure our doors stay open. It won't be easy. Anything but. However it is a situation we are only too familiar with. We have faced down this kind of funding crisis many times over the last 13 years and we are confident of doing so again. Never once have we turned away a single person who has come to us for emergency food. Not once. We're all pretty proud of that record and we have no intention of allowing such a thing to happen in the coming winter.</p><p>So. How can you help? Well there are two options. Of course you can donate a few quid on this page and if you do so we will be hugely appreciative. Or maybe you might want to go a stage further and do exactly what I am doing - live off a First Base emergency food parcel for half a week and raise so cash either with a page like this one or by using more traditional sponsorship forms. So how would that work? Easy. You can call me on either 07770 443483 or 01387 279680 or you can e mail me at markglenmill@aol.com. I will then deliver you a three day food parcel and sponsorship forms should you need any. Tell you what. I'll throw in a full signed set of my back list of books as a thank you. Then it is a case of eating emergency food for three days and chasing in a few donations.&nbsp;</p><p>So that's that I guess. Please support us either by donating to this page or by starting up a page of your own. Maybe I will see you soon with a box of food and a bag of books!</p><p>All the best</p><p>Mark</p>",127,2,"2020-03-31 20/2018-05-23 60",https://www.justgiving.com/MarkSimonFrankland,2020-03-31,12556,15000,"I'm raising cash to make sure the First Base food bank survives the winter"

I recently signed up to volunteer for one of Urban Community Projects' initiatives, the Camden Mobile Food Bank, to deliver food donations to vulnerable families who live on local estates. I signed up for the initiative because of 2 major reasons:<br><br>1) More so than ever, this is a time when&nbsp;the recipients&nbsp;really need our help as many of them, be it the elderly or ill,&nbsp;are confined to their homes and are unable to collect the food parcels themselves. &nbsp;<br><br>2) I myself have been fortunate enough to be a recipient of other people's generosity of time and financial resources, and I know from firsthand experience that a small act of kindness has the power to make a significant difference to another individual's life.&nbsp;To the extent that I&nbsp;am able to, I would like to keep this 'cycle of generosity' alive. <br><br>I am appealing to you because alongside my volunteering to deliver food, I&nbsp;have created a page&nbsp;to help raise funds for <em>Urban Community Projects </em>so that the charity is able to continue carrying out essential services to vulnerable members of our community, at a time when it is most needed. If you are able to, I ask that you please donate through the&nbsp;<em>Just Giving&nbsp; </em>website to&nbsp;support <em>Urban Community Projects</em>. <br><br>I will match your donations by committing to&nbsp;doing as many food delivery trips as I can possibly squeeze in outside of my work hours. &nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance.<br>Sello </p>",57,57,"2020-07-10 30/2020-06-23 20/2020-06-17 20/2020-06-10 50/2020-06-09 50/2020-05-29 50/2020-05-18 50/2020-05-12 100/2020-05-07 30/2020-05-06 30/2020-05-04 50/2020-05-04 15/2020-05-04 50/2020-05-03 30/2020-05-01 100/2020-04-29 100/2020-04-25 50/2020-04-25 30/2020-04-21 20/2020-04-21 200/2020-04-21 30/2020-04-21 100/2020-04-21 100/2020-04-21 25/2020-04-20 20/2020-04-20 50/2020-04-19 30/2020-04-19 20/2020-04-17 50/2020-04-17 100/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 10/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 50/2020-04-16 30/2020-04-16 20/2020-04-16 50/2020-04-15 40/2020-04-15 20/2020-04-15 30/2020-04-15 50/2020-04-15 50/2020-04-15 20/2020-04-15 20",https://www.justgiving.com/Sello-Lekalakala,2020-07-10,5475,5000,"A Helping Hand "

My wife chose to volunteer with the foodbank, while on furlough from her job in Kingsbridge, and has seen the enormous pressure they are suddenly under. I think the numbers of people being helped have jumped from around 25 to 110 per week. They have already had some very kind donations but, as you can imagine, the demand is using up the money fast. To try and raise money my children came up with the idea of singing a song&nbsp;</span><span><a href=""https://youtu.be/qBhFYFel4lw"" target=""_blank""></a></span><a href=""https://youtu.be/qBhFYFel4lw"" target=""_blank""><span>here</span></a>&nbsp;<span>so please give it a watch and, if you can, donate to this worthwhile cause.</span></p><p><span><b>Why you really should care</b></span></p><p><span>I wanted to mention one last thing that has really stuck with my wife. when she visited a family recently. The main earner was self-employed and his business had been forced to stop. As you may know, that means the family will not receive support until June. The lady that answered the door ended up in tears as she explained that she never expected to be in this situation. I have to admit it was very moving to hear her story but thank goodness the Foodbank has been able to help. Please help if you can and if, like the lady above, you find yourself in need, get in touch.

I would love to raise £1000 pounds for the Food Bank in Worcester to help put a smile on numerous family faces this Christmas. Can you spare £5.00 and go without that bottle of wine, others can't even afford a loaf of bread to feed their children and we sit eating takeaways in front of the TV in our lovely warm homes. Please help me by SHARING this post and donate what you can.... The more we share, the more people we reach, the more we can raise and the more people we can make SMILE! Come on Facebookers lets do sometime productive and help the people who really need it!.<br><br>"" I took my dogs for a walk last night and found myself walking and walking after over five miles I found myself at a local pub! The dogs were welcome in and I sat alone in the corner waiting for my husband to pick me up when I got talking to a stranger. One hour later it transpires that the guy was an ex- serviceman who due to PTS had found himself living locally in a tent, we got talking and although his life was tough he took nothing from the government but did odd jobs in order to provide for himself. I brought him a pint and later my son and husband turned up, he offered to buy us all a drink which I decided as we were driving, he still came back from the bar with three orange juices. We have so much and he has nothing but yet he still brought us a drink which he could not afford. We all have so much in life and yet others have nothing and yet they are willing to share what they have! My son learnt so much tonight, on the way home he asked if we could give all his old toys to other people for Christmas that didn't have things for Christmas! Tomorrow I am off to do a weeks shop and leave it with the landlord to give to that man as last night was a truly moving experience not just for me but for my entire family! A Ramon night but such a humbling evening...

Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year.

Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure.

Were working closely with our network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how we can best support each food bank in the coming months to make sure that theyre able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.

Women have to rely on food banks for sanitary items, due to their vast expense. Issues with universal credit have left many families without any money over the Christmas period.

It's a huge milestone for us, especially given the current global pandemic and the impact it's having on small businesses like ours around the world. &nbsp;Because community is one of the most important things to us as a business, and a team, w<span>e want to celebrate by giving back. Over the next 12 months, we will be undertaking 40 good deeds, big and small, to support our local community, other businesses and charities close to our hearts.&nbsp;</span></p><p>We're kicking off by walking, running, cycling and dancing 400 miles in 40 days to raise money for The Trussell Trust. This is not your usual sponsored walk/cycle/run because several members of the team are self isolating - we're going to be getting creative and completing our miles in all sorts of ways, including exercise bikes, step machines!&nbsp;</p><p>We've chosen to support The Trussell Trust for this because we want to support the vital service that they offer. More and more people are being forced to use food banks because they cannot afford the basics in life. Last year, food banks in the Trussell Trusts network provided 1.6 million three-day emergency food parcels to people in crisis, with over 500,000 of these going to children. This was an increase of almost 20% on the previous year. Now, as the Coronavirus pandemic develops, its likely that increasing numbers of people will need support from their local food bank. As food bank staff and volunteers work to source and distribute food to people who need support, their resources are becoming increasingly stretched as they come under additional pressure. The Trussell Trust are working closely with their network of over 1,200 food banks to work out how each food bank can be best supported in the coming months to make sure that they're able to continue to help people in crisis in their local communities.</p><p>Anything you can give to help this worthy cause will make a difference. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for being part of our 40 year journey and for helping us give back to communities across the UK. We hope you are staying safe and well.</p>",8,8,"2020-06-05 60/2020-05-21 30/2020-05-21 50/2020-05-21 10/2020-05-21 20/2020-05-04 30/2020-05-02 40/2020-05-01 20",https://www.justgiving.com/SG400for40,2020-06-05,260,400,"Smith Goodfellow's 400 for 40"

I decided to set a challenge to some friends. There are several great efforts going on to raise money for the NHS charities, so I thought i’d go with something that is local to many of my friends and colleagues - this is the area right next to Dell Glasgow (remember that place!?)<br><br>Challenge is simple  (but not easy!) &amp; for the golfers out there, but anyone can try it! <br><br>Just like several similar challenges, the golfer needs to get 20 balls, place a bucket, basin or plant pot etc. 10 feet away. Film yourself hitting all 20 and for everyone you get in the bucket - donate (a minimum) of £2.00 to the just giving page below. <br><br>https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/carlo-cocozza<br><br>The idea is to get a lot of people taking part, so please post your video and nominate another garden golfer! <br><br>If you are tagged in this, you are nominated 😉 good luck!<br><br>Eg get 1 out of 20, donate £2 (or whatever you choose). <br>Get none in, donate at least £2 anyway.

An explosion in warehouses storing 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate ripped through Beiruts port on 4th August 2020. More than 150 people died, 5,000 were injured and 300,000 left homeless. With the economy already in dire straits and people struggling in the coronavirus pandemic, the disaster has led to a new humanitarian crisis. With your support, Islamic Help aims to assist the most vulnerable by providing desperately-needed food, water and PPE.

The damage to Beiruts port from the explosion disrupted food imports and supplies at a time when the countrys economy is already on its knees.
